[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech. Great panel. Mike Elkins here. Alex Wilhelm,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Carolina, Milanese. We're going to talk about the Ethereum merge it seems to have gone off
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.760]   without a hitch. Why? That's good for the environment, but bad for EVGA. Adobe is spending a huge amount
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.960]   of money to acquire a contributor and late breaking news. It looks like another hack. This time,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.360]   Grand Theft Auto 6. It's all coming up next. On Twit. Podcasts you love.

[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:10.560]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech, the show we cover the week's Tech news of which there is
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.240]   a stunning amount this week. So we will get right to it joining us Carolina Milanesi. She is
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.400]   a founder of a I guess is it an analyst? Are you an A? Is it face fair to call you an analyst?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.720]   I am an analyst. Yes. But also the founder of the heart of Tech which is more than analytical.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.760]   I guess you could say that. Yes. There's some social impact there. Yeah.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.320]   Heart back into Tech and principal at Creative Strategies and was at the Apple event last week
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   where it was 113 degrees. We'll talk about that in just a bit. Also with us, editor in chief
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.960]   TechCrunch plus and good friend Alex Wilhelm who is on his 20, you said 27th episode.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.720]   I think this is number 28. So we're getting up towards 30. At which point I think I'll demand
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.120]   like some sort of like shirt or maybe a hat. That'd be fun. Did we not send you the Feds yet?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.920]   I think 30 you get the Feds. Oh, okay. So just a couple more. So in two months time everybody,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.160]   I'm going to have a Feds. Watch out. Mike Elgin has the Feds which he has worn in Feds which is
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.280]   fascinating. Hello Mike. And I was the only one wearing a Feds. They all wore baseball hats in Feds.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.880]   Mike is today in Spain getting ready for his Gastronomod adventure in Barcelona.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.640]   That's right. Tomorrow. The Seaside which is a beautiful town just out of Barcelona.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.040]   Yes. Very nice. Great to have you. And I will be in Feds next week in Morocco.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.200]   Yes. Are you going to do the Morocco Gastronomod? The experience starts in about three weeks but
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.280]   we'll be there next weekend. Yeah. This is like your busy season. I didn't realize. Yeah. We're
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.440]   we're trying to catch up from the COVID doldrums. It's hysterical because I was looking at pictures
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.080]   from the Wahaka experience which we did and I realized that's almost a year ago now.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   So we got to get moving. That was October. Yeah. It was for Halloween. Yeah. It was the day of the
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.800]   day. So it ended up the end of the month. That was really fun. Boy, it was fun. Oh my goodness.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.960]   Mike, how are you so trim given that your job is going around the world and eating delicious things?
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   The secret is that the cameras only gets me from here up. I hate them. That's the secret of
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.520]   seeing trim. I hate them. I don't know how he does it. It drives me crazy. I gained weight in
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   Wahaka. Like we were eating chocolate and coffee and tortillas and oh my god. That's the best I've
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.160]   ever. So good. All right. I said there was news. We got to do it. I guess the first story.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.720]   I thought we might be like doing wall to wall coverage of the Ethereum merge. Like oh my god
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.120]   Ethereum is crashed. It went so smoothly. Thursday Ethereum, which is the I think now safe to say
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.080]   while Bitcoin gets a lot of the attention. Ethereum is probably the biggest, I don't know what its
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.120]   market cap it is, but the most popular of the Bitcoins is what most NFTs use ETH ETH ETH.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   It moved from the very energy costly proof of work system on Thursday to the proof of stake
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:38.640]   system saving. They say 99% of the energy used and and I'm sure there's a big sigh from the
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:48.480]   from the world at this putting a lot of Bitcoin miners at a business. Alex, is this part of your
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.120]   portfolio to cover crypto? Yeah. Yeah. In fact, I have a dedicated crypto reporter on my team.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.400]   And so I've been tracking this pretty carefully and what kind of shocked me the most was the
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.120]   smoothness of it. The Ethereum merge the move from proof of work to proof of stake, which is a
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.840]   different way of kind of figuring out what transactions are legit and handing out newly issued tokens.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   It was pushed back and pushed back and delayed and delayed. It became almost a joke like when
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.400]   will this ever happen? And then it finally did and seemingly fingers crossed for everyone else out
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.560]   there without a hiccup. I was very impressed actually. The bad news is all those guys who spent a lot
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.800]   of money on custom rigs with giant GPUs and a six to do mining are now finding it unprofitable.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.760]   So here's the thing. I think that's not a bad thing. Yeah.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.320]   It's not a bad thing. Anybody who was doing that was simply ignoring the environmental costs,
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.960]   which was well documented. They knew what they were doing. They were basically just,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:59.200]   I've heard statistics like the mining of Bitcoin generally was vastly more energy-consuming than
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.920]   all the savings from solar energy combined in the world. So I'm not too torn up about the fact that
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   they sort of lost it. Plus, as you pointed out, they had plenty of warning that this was coming.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.800]   You want to hear a crazy stat. This is from Statista. The average energy consumption for
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:29.360]   a single Bitcoin transaction was 2,188 kilowatt hours, 2,188 kilowatt hours for one transaction,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:38.720]   which is the little bar to the right, 148 kilowatt hours. That's 100,000 visa transactions.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   So Bitcoin is basically unsustainable. Now Bitcoin is still on proof of work. It's still using all
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:54.800]   that energy. But according to PC Magazine, it's so expensive now to mine Bitcoin. Nobody's doing it.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.280]   It's just hard to find a place where energy is so cheap that you can do it profitably.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   The Ethereum move is really a point of leadership by Ethereum, where it's getting a ton of press.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   And now that they're doing this, the rest of the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency communities
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.840]   will have to respond to this, because it's a world in which you can burn that kind of energy
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.520]   for Bitcoin mining transactions, et cetera, et cetera. I just think it's untenable. It's
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.960]   unacceptable. It's socially unacceptable. And they're going to have to do something about the
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.440]   massive energy consumption. And again, Ethereum here is pointing the way. So it's really a positive
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.160]   thing that they did that. It was a very risky thing. Of course, there's Ethereum miners who are
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:51.760]   making money with proof of work, who were upset. There was talk of a fork. Did the fork happen?
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.560]   Alex? So there have been forks of Ethereum before, but what's really interesting about the situation
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.280]   and what Mike's talking about, the pressure, essentially from this successful merge to take
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.360]   the remaining chains that are on proof of work and move them over to proof of stake,
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.560]   is that it's not just a technology conversation. It's also almost a religious conflict, because
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.680]   if you talk to some of these Bitcoin maxis or people that really put Bitcoin above all,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.560]   just because of how it functions, proof of work is a very important component to why they think
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.280]   that. And so the argument, and I'm not saying that I endorsed this, but the argument is that now
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.520]   that Ethereum has moved to proof of stake, it's effectively more centralized. And you can argue
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.040]   that different ways. But the power of Bitcoin, such as it is described by its fans, is that,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   yes, it is hard to mine. Yes, it is very energy intensive, but it's so spread out around the
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.720]   world that it's essentially bulletproof. And there's some reasonableness to that, but I end up much
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.920]   closer to where Mike is, which is saying that, guys, can we not? If it's a possibility, burn all
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.120]   this energy for effectively, no reason? There are. You could buy in a Bitcoin miner rig that would
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:05.680]   heat your house in Scandinavia. It was a little literal. I mean, I'm not joking. It was a stove
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.160]   for your house that incidentally would also like Bitcoin and generate that much heat. And that's
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.040]   why it's not profitable. It's not economical, because electricity is just, I mean, the people
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.640]   were really making money with Bitcoin mining were in China next to hydroelectric dams, or the cost
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:28.000]   of energy was virtually zero. So this PC magazine says, they've talked to a lot of miners. The
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.080]   merge, kill it all off. All my stuff is idling now, said one miner. They look at other coins,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.920]   Ergo, Ravencoin, that still are unproof of work, but they have so little value that mining them is
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.720]   unprofitable. Almost all the profit I didn't realize this had gone to Ethereum. So this was a very
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:57.280]   important thing, very risky. And it worked so amazing. Well done. Well done.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.000]   There's a tie though between climate change and what you just said, because if you look at Chinese
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.120]   weather in the last couple of months, there's been a historic drought in China, which has led to a
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.720]   decrease in the flow through dammable rivers. And in essence, that's led to a power crunch in part
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.040]   to the country over the last couple of weeks and months. So all that cheap power that used to be
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.240]   used for mining Bitcoin before the Chinese government banned that ended up kind of going away. And so
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   there's a full circle of cause and effect here with humans trying to do things that I appreciated
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.640]   the irony of even if it was quite sad to see an entire country go through such a staggering drought.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:39.040]   Yeah. Well, we're going through it here in the West as well. So one of the side effects of this
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.880]   is a lot. There are a lot of GPUs on eBay right now. And the price of GPUs is tumbling.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:55.680]   The world has changed. In fact, it's cost Nvidia substantially. Another story I think somewhat
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:04.880]   related. One of Nvidia's biggest OEMs EVGA, I think more than half of the Nvidia cards was sold
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:12.640]   by EVGA is is ending its relationship with EVGA with a G force with with Nvidia.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   So they're going to sell them until they run in a stock, but they're not going to make any more.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:23.600]   They make power supplies and other things. Apparently there was a little battle, a little,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:31.360]   a little bad blood between Nvidia and and EVGA. They were upset that Nvidia was undercutting
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   their prices. They were upset that they're suddenly the profit margin collapsed as the GPU market
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:45.440]   collapsed as Bitcoin mining collapsed. And so they're just getting out of the business. Here's
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:53.680]   here's the gross margin. The light blue is the people who make Nvidia cards based on the
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:00.400]   Nvidia platform and sell them. The blue one is Nvidia. Its margin went up while theirs went to
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.800]   almost nothing over the last 20 years. I'm in awe of this chart. Carolina, my presumption is that
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   one doesn't have to be an analyst to be able to look at that chart and go, I'm out of this business.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:20.960]   Yeah, that was pretty straightforward. Yeah. Yeah. Nvidia themselves hurting their stock prices
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.040]   have tumbled as well. They had an excess inventory of cards. They will next week have GTC,
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.760]   their big conference and they're expected to announce the 4,000 line of video cards they've
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.320]   been using the RTX 3000 for the last couple of years. So, you know, but it's now it's mostly just,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.720]   you know, gaming Nvidia does have a good business in self-driving vehicles.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   And AI. I'm curious about this. So I need to buy a new gaming PC, which I know is always
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.280]   dicey territory on Twix. Everyone here knows more about PCs than I do. But I didn't for a while
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.800]   because, you know, all the Ethereum kiddos were buying up all their graphics cards and I didn't
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.640]   want to get into that fight. Is now a good time to build a new PC or should I still wait? I'm not
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.080]   sure where we are on chip shortages. Well, there are a lot of GPUs out there, but I think a lot of
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.680]   them have seen some heavy use. They've been road hard and put away wet as the same goes. So I
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.360]   don't wouldn't go to eBay to get one, but it has certainly, I think, tanked the prices. When the
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.480]   4,000 is announced next week, probably will come out for a month or two. You probably see 3,000
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.560]   prices go down and a good 3080 is going to get you a very it's going to be good for a gaming rate.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.800]   You have so you're in your little see, I know more about you than you.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.160]   You're now in your little house out in the backyard. Yes, where I used to son in my youth.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.200]   And as I remember, there are quite a few little gaming things. You just sit out there and play
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:58.800]   games until somebody notices and then you files copy. Oh man, I if yeah, that would be great.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:06.640]   I hear about it. I hear about research, Alex. See, Carolina's on something there. No, but people
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.560]   always talk about how people have these jobs. They don't do anything. I have never managed
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:17.040]   to find one of those jobs. And so no, I the game you have to right here. You have to. I mean,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:22.080]   I'm I'm leading the team. We're doing a big conference. I'm in charge of a SaaS product like
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.040]   I just gave you time. I just know. No, no, I'm dreaming now, like imagine waking up and like playing
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.960]   games and having fun and not stressing out about results and stuff sounds lovely.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.280]   What game are you playing or will will you be playing on this brand new gaming rig?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.200]   Oh, I mean, this is a bit nerdy, but if you're if you're a gamer and you like city building
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.120]   simulations, there's a new game out called farthest frontier, just captured my heart and my soul,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.160]   my eyes and my hands. I'm obsessed with it. It's a survival builder. So it's like,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   it's designed to make it hard on you. Oh, I'm playing it. Yeah. See, I'm a ballheim guy, big
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.600]   valheim guy. And I've been playing lately, satisfactory, which is similar. It's like, it's a fun game.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.680]   It's a no man's lad. Just streamed a bunch on Twitch. It's a no man's land kind of here on a planet,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.800]   and you have to start mining, gathering and mining resources. This looks this looks a little more like
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.880]   has kind of age of empire graphics. Yes, it does. And there's different difficulties.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.600]   It's come early. There is combat. You get attacked by large rating parties. You have to build walls
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.680]   and hire soldiers. And it's very complex. It's definitely still an early access, though,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.960]   just as a warning point, like the game is still being expanded, tweaked, improved, and so great.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.160]   Yeah. Does it actually look like this? Yes, it looks just like that. Satisfactory, though,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.880]   that's the first person builder for factories, right? Yeah. See that threw me because I played
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.760]   factorial, which is top down. This is like factorial, but it's first person. Yeah.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.560]   That's like saying it's like racing a car, but you're facing backwards. Like, how does that work?
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:03.040]   No. All right. I'll just show you a little video from last night's stream. All right.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   Apologize for the audio. I was trying to figure out. So see, I am wielding manufacturing things.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.960]   I'm sitting up power lines. I've got a conveyor belt bringing in my mining, coming down from the
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.520]   hill there, building stuff, building more stuff. So yeah, see, there's my, that's my little,
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.720]   I don't know what that is. It's a smelter, a schmelter. It's taking the coppers coming down,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.920]   and they conveyor belt and the schmelter, but I got to get power to the schmelter.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   And then I have the, it's a very fun game. I didn't know Leo that we were the exact same nerd
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.640]   in two different bodies. It's saying, if this isn't your style of game, we're sorry, but we
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.440]   instead of killing people, we're, oh, but watch out because there's this little guy's going to
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.200]   get at me. And I have to, so there's a little bit of survival involved. I say, but, but not,
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.800]   not a huge amount. I mean, you can handle this rodent pretty easily.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.960]   Is it stuck? He can't get up the wall. I'm just telling him, I'm just telling him right now,
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.840]   because I died. He killed me and there's a box with all my stuff in it. And I got to get around
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.040]   him and get the box with my stuff anyway. You know, who, this is not the show for that. This is not,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:25.040]   this is Leo Alex and Leo's gaming show. I apologize to Carolina and Mike, neither of whom have time
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.000]   to waste on this guy. I'm going to play for this frontier. That looks, that's really good.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.960]   Just came out. I'll, I'll refund you if you don't like it personally, because I'm, I'm obsessed.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.040]   But anyways, um, graphics cards, computers, I think we were somewhere around there. Oh, yeah.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.120]   You should be able to play that pretty easily. Yeah. Get a 1080. You'll be fine. No, I play on
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:54.960]   a AMD, uh, Ryzen, uh, seven with a 30 80, uh, on a 55 inch LED. I don't need a real life. I've got
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.760]   a virtual life. I just go and I play and I play and that's it. You know, you know, Leo, I, I, I'm not
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.560]   into video games at all. I've played him before, but I really don't play them these days. Don't you
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:13.600]   want to build a little town in the farthest frontier? I heard about a genre of games that I didn't
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.680]   know existed, but I read about it in wine enthusiasts, which is basically virtual winery games.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:26.000]   You heard of these? You have to, you, you set up the terroir and then you, you plant your vines and
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.680]   you'd go through all this stuff, all the struggles and tribulations of a winemaker. Sounds fascinating
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.040]   to me, but this to me reminds me of like railroad simulator where you drive a train. Right.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.280]   Railroad tycoon. Uh, there's farming simulators. I'm not shocked that there's a wine simulator.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.600]   There's all, there's a game that just came out in which you build your own university and deal with
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.560]   all the, the hijinks that come up with like hiring professors and so forth. So Mike, gaming is now
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.560]   so broad and so niche that no one's not a gamer. They're just someone who hasn't found their game.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.880]   This is a game, however, that I shall never play pen and teller as a joke some years ago,
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:11.840]   met a game called desert bus and the whole premise of the game is you'd get in the bus
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.880]   and you'd drive. By the way, your driver is Alex. Hey, hey Alex.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:25.040]   Why have we crashed yet? No, no, this is the game. This is the game for hours. This is an eight-hour
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:36.480]   video on YouTube. This is the game. Wow. Oh, it's night. It's night. Okay. So we just, you know,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.200]   it's a little change of scenery. Uh, I don't even know if you have to steer to be honest with you.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:48.400]   It's just, it was a parody, but it's kind of legendary now. Buss desert bus. It was on a Sega.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.320]   This is a playthrough, by the way, which means that it's an eight-hour video of that. And then you,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.000]   I guess you arrive. I guess you arrive. Let me see at the very end.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.920]   Do you get to Los Angeles? I don't know.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:12.640]   If you're all the audio stream, imagine the worst graphics you've seen in your entire life.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:19.120]   No art and annoying sound effects. Yeah, that's it. Look at that. Look at the mileage,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:27.680]   the mileage meter is ticking over though. We've gone 7,000, 179.3 miles. Wow. It's 7, 17 at night.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.240]   And the desert's pretty much an unchanging landscape. Eight hours in.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:40.080]   I don't think it's going to be a best-seller pen and tellers desert bus. It's kind of legendary,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.000]   to be honest with you, but it's not farthest frontier. This looks good. I'm glad you mentioned
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.400]   this. All right. Where were we? GPUs. The GTX 4000 next week from Nvidia. GTC.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.360]   We will probably not cover that stream, but I think it'll be something to watch. And it might be,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.440]   I think you're going to see a general drop in older video cards because of the 4000 and because
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:12.880]   of this Ethereum merge. Is the loss of EVGA a big deal? Because I was on some gaming subreddits
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.400]   and people were pretty cut up about this. And to me, as one level nerd above knowing that,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.160]   I was a little perplexed by X. I thought they were all Nvidia cards and turns out I was wrong.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:29.200]   And I don't know. Nvidia is a foundry. So they design them. And then they have a bunch of people
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:37.680]   who make the cards. EVGA's revenue is 80% GeForce GPUs. So it's huge because they're basically
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:44.400]   turning their back on their business. 80% of their business. The press kind of played up the
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   acrimony between these former partners. But the reality is that the business is changing
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:23:00.160]   in a bad way. So the part that Nvidia is doing is great, as you can see from that chart. With that
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.760]   chart doesn't show you, it shows you the declining gross margins for the manufacturer. But it doesn't
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.960]   show you the rapidly rising costs for design and manufacturing and all that stuff. So it's
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:20.400]   really the risk here is that the price in the future, where there's a glut now, because what
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.320]   we're talking about, but there's a risk in the future that the price of these cards is going to
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.600]   go through the roof because they're so complex now and so difficult to design and manufacture that.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.040]   It's hard to believe that any company is really going to want to be in this business,
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.320]   unless they're really getting much higher gross margins than we see here.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.480]   It's just not a great business anymore. The Nvidia,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:56.720]   at the end of September 20th, they will announce the Lovelace architecture, which is probably aptly
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:04.560]   named. And what they've been trying to do for the last two years is find a new market for
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:12.080]   their chips. Smart cars, self-driving vehicles use Nvidia chips to a great degree. So does
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.320]   artificial intelligence, machine learning. So I guess it's really about a transition to some degree.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   They're not alone in this, right? Well, I was trying to do the same thing. After dominating the
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:31.280]   smartphone market and other smartphone market flattening, they need to look at something else and
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   driverless car is where they're going next. Intel is in much the same boat, right?
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:47.680]   They hit rock bottom this week and they're desperately trying to figure out what to do next. They've
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:54.880]   kind of split their business into foundry and fab. They've decided for a long time their value
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.960]   proposition was we design and we build our own chips. That integration though, some say,
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.160]   Ben Thompson has been quite vocal about this, kept them from innovating at the speed of the
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.680]   company like TSMC, which only builds chips was able to innovate. TSMC had all this revenue for
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.600]   companies like Apple and they were able to take that revenue, invent new processes,
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.280]   come up with some very sophisticated chip manufacturing stuff that Intel couldn't do,
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.400]   didn't do, they didn't have that revenue to do that. And so they lapped Intel and Intel's,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.160]   you know, under Pat Gelsinger, they're a new relatively new CEO has decided, well, we're
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.480]   going to try two businesses. We want to be a foundry. In fact, he said, we could make apples chips.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.520]   We want to make apples chips. They're breaking ground on a giant fab. Now that the chips act
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:51.040]   passed, the $52 billion subsidy act from Washington passed a couple of weeks ago until now is going
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.240]   ahead on its $20 billion factory because some of that will be federally subsidized in Arizona.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:05.440]   We are in interesting times. That comment drives me nuts because if they could build apples chip,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.920]   why haven't today? They seem to consume less power and kick maximum. I have to point out,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.640]   Apple didn't say, oh, yeah, you can build our chips. No. They said, well, yeah, we're going to keep,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.560]   they pretty much buy up as much of the production this TSMC could come up with. And it's to their
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:28.240]   credit. Apple just released and you were there, I know, at the event in Cupertino a couple of
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:34.640]   weeks ago, Carolina, they just announced the new iPhone. It's hard to tell because Apple doesn't
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.880]   give unit sales out or anything like that. And it is true. If you didn't order on Friday,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.520]   love last week, you may not have picked one up on the 16th as I did. You might be waiting till
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.360]   November at this point. I haven't looked at the lead times, but I think Apple was able to make
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.680]   as many phones as they want, you think? Well, even even if you ordered on Friday as I did,
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:09.440]   for the 14 arrived, but the pro is due on October 4th for me. So, yeah, let me just let me pretend
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.280]   to buy another one and just here's a pro max. I bought it in gold because that was the most
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   available. Sometimes you have to finagle. Apparently black is the one that I thought it would be
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:27.600]   purple, but black is the one that is highest demand right now. Yeah, let's see, I still have to check
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.800]   some boxes, no trade in blah, blah, blah. I'm going to buy it outright. I'm going to choose any
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.120]   care. You kind of click a lot of boxes to find out when you're going to get this, no Apple care.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:44.080]   Finally, October 25th. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Is right. So maybe they aren't able to get as many chips as
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:51.200]   they'd like out of TSMC. I don't know if it's if it's supply versus demand. I think that
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.880]   although I'm sure that Apple took this into account that the dynamic island,
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:05.680]   as much as I wish still that they gave it a different name, is really getting a broader appeal than not
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.040]   just the camera. I think the pro max has always been the device that was even for people that really
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:18.160]   wanted everything and more from the camera and the larger size. Now, now you have the 14 plus
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.840]   that would take care of people that just wanted a larger model, but not necessarily all the bells
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:31.280]   and whistles and the price point that comes with it. The dynamic island just gives a different vibe
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:38.720]   to the whole phone. I think it's just broadened the appeal. I'm not surprised that the pro is
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.320]   into November for delivery. If you combine the fact that early adopters tend to ask for higher
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:54.080]   devices and buy higher spec devices, that's what you have in pre-orders usually. People don't
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:01.600]   usually rush into pre-order for the entry level models. I should also point out that it may not be
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:10.800]   the TSMC A16 or A15 for the Apple 14 and 14 plus that are in short supply, but these legacy
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.720]   nodes, this is actually the bigger problem is these older chips, nobody's making them or they're
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.240]   making them slowly or there's a shortage. It may just be like the accelerometer chip.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:28.400]   That may be the problem. That may be the shortage. I like the dynamic island, by the way, Carolina.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.040]   Did you like it? I do too. I don't even mind the name, although it's a little Gilligan's island.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:42.160]   It sounds like a reality show. The other thing that is a wild card for Apple and for lots of
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:48.320]   other companies that are trying to sell electronic products at massive scale like Apple does
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.360]   is China, which has become a very unreliable place because of their zero-covid policy,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.840]   which still exists. If somebody sneezes in a factory, they shut the whole thing down,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.720]   they travel everybody inside and they stay that way for three weeks or whatever. It's really
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.840]   about a deal and it's largely driven at this point by Xi Jinping in the upcoming
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:15.040]   Communist Party conference where he's going to be installed as emperor for life or whatever.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.600]   He doesn't want any sort of covid bad news and so he's willing to
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:27.440]   jettison their economy to a certain extent to keep the covid numbers down. The other place where
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:34.240]   this affects manufacturing is that some of these lockdowns, some of these slowdowns are still
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.960]   happening in Chinese ports. Not only are electronics having to come out of Chinese ports, many of
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   the components from elsewhere outside of China have to come into China so they can be put together
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.160]   with Chinese components by Chinese workers and then shipped out. If there's slowdowns in the
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:59.040]   ports that they lock down the ports because of covid or whatever, it's likely that it's not going
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:06.560]   to be that bad that there's no way for Apple to know exactly what's going to be shut down,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.280]   what's going to go into lockdown. It's just unpredictable at this point.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.040]   Of course, Apple is as a result building plants in Vietnam and India, Brazil,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.200]   they're trying to expand out of China but that's going to take a while.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.640]   I should point out that you can get the low end iPhone 14 Tuesday.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:35.440]   I guess it's always the case that the early sales are two dummies like me, the enthusiast
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.240]   who buy the higher end phones and the less expensive phones are pretty much available.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.000]   In fact, sweet, you could get it tomorrow if you wanted to go down to the store.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.600]   I have a question, Leo, because I was watching the Apple event as I always do and paid attention
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.760]   and I can buy a new phone if I want and I have a purple 12, I think. I think it's a purple 12.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.760]   I don't know. I like it. It's fine. It's not a pro. It's not a max.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:06.080]   I'm cheap and take terrible photos. I'm not the target demographic for this, but I'm just curious.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.960]   I was so sorry for you with only a small camera bump when you could have a massive camera bump
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.160]   on your phone. I took it out of my case for that dramatic point because I don't have an
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:26.560]   iPhone all the time. Do you like it? Because to me, this feels more like an unusual process for buying it.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:36.640]   Okay, then. I'll speak and I'll let Carolina, who is more expert on this, but I think you are
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.440]   fine with what you got. I think this has been the case for about three or four years with Apple
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:48.160]   that we're really at a plateau. Okay, they had the dynamic island, but that's kind of like putting
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:55.600]   fins on a Cadillac. It's a aesthetic thing, but it isn't added to the real functionality of the
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.560]   phone. It's got a faster processor. I noticed Face ID is faster than on my iPhone. I went from a
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:07.200]   12 as well. My iPhone 12, I noticed maybe the camera in the hands of people really know what
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:14.240]   they're doing. You could take advantage of those 48 megapixel pro-rob photos and do something
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.720]   interesting. I've seen some really interesting things on the halide site and stuff, but most
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.840]   people aren't going to notice any difference. I think it is a thousand dollar expenditure. Most
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:30.480]   people won't need to make and because of economic woes probably won't make. So I expect Apple
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.760]   to have a little fewer sale. What do you think, Carolyn? Do you think this will be a slow quarter
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:42.560]   for Apple, slower than usual? I don't think so for a couple of reasons. One, I agree what you said
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:49.760]   as far as the enhancement. For a lot of people, if you had the 13, you're fine. It is not really
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:59.120]   that you need to upgrade. Certainly the 13. Let's remember that the phone is still a very emotional
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:05.920]   purchase for a lot of consumers. It is part of your status. It is a way to show that you have the
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:13.680]   latest and greatest. There's that visual part of you that has nothing to do with that whether or not
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.920]   you need it or if it's any better than what you had before. You just go through the motion. I think
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:25.840]   there's a lot of carrier support right now, not just for the latest model, but even last year.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.960]   If I can get everybody onto 5G networks, they will. You see a lot of promotions.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:40.400]   Lastly, very few people in the US still buy a phone at right. They all have it on an installment
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:50.960]   plan. Upgrading your phone doesn't really see a huge payout as it used to even when you have to buy
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:58.240]   and pay tax on it and then do your installment payments. For a lot of consumers, you're talking
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:05.920]   about adding $5, $6 maybe to what their payment for last year was last year model. I don't know
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:14.240]   that Apple would necessarily feel the pain of the recession because they already have the higher
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.880]   chunk of the market from a disposable income perspective to consumer. They never
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:30.240]   seem to suffer. Overall, the mobile market has always been pretty resilient because we are so
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.400]   dependent on phones. Although you might see maybe a slow down in replacement, so a lengthening of
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:42.000]   the cycle of maybe two, three months, I don't think that the market will suffer.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.480]   It's an excellent point. There's not an economic decision. It's an emotional decision.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.200]   Apple is really good at chipping away at market share a couple weeks ago. They rose to about 50%
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:05.760]   for the first time. In the US. One of the things that I think is driving that is other Apple devices
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.880]   become so compelling. The M1 MacBook Pros were super compelling to the people who switch around
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:19.680]   between a Microsoft device or Chromebook or whatever. People like me, I switch from a Chromebook to
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:26.320]   a MacBook Pro because I just had to have it. It was so good. Back in the old days, I used to switch
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.520]   back and forth between an Android phone and an iPhone. No more. The combination of the
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.920]   degree to which I love my Apple watch and the degree to which I need a MacBook now
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:45.280]   and I've always loved the iPad. It doesn't make any sense for me to have anything other than an
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.880]   iPhone. I think a lot of people are slowly making that decision. We were in
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.360]   Provence with some folks a couple weeks ago and I was just listening to the conversation.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.600]   These are not super techy folks in the most part and they were talking about their phones.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.880]   About half had iPhones, about half had Android phones. But the Android phone users were all
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.840]   saying, "Yeah, my next phone, I'm just going to get an iPhone." I think there's a lot of
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:19.040]   trading over from Android to Apple that is just kind of a constant. They just are always growing
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.560]   their market share. Again, I think it's a larger Apple environment that drives that.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.320]   You said something interesting currently. I want to pursue. You said there's a lot of support
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.520]   from the carriers because they want to move people to 5G. Is that a marketing thing or is there a
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.040]   technical reason they want to get on the 5G networks? What is their instance?
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:45.600]   Well, the 3G network is shutting down. You still have some users that have phones that are so old.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.120]   Yeah, they sent my mom on the phone because she was on sprint and they were going to turn off
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:58.560]   that network. They just sent her a phone. Then there's just an efficiency from a network perspective
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.440]   that for the carriers, they just want to move as many people as possible on the 5G network
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:13.840]   just for efficiency reasons. You've seen even the trade in numbers this year, 800 to $1,000. Although,
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.480]   I'm not quite sure what you need to trade in to get that. You probably need to trade in
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:29.920]   a 2013 Pro Max to get that number because I traded in a iPhone 12 Pro Max and I got $320.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   Nowhere near D8 and $1,000. But they're the most generous that we've seen so far.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:44.720]   I have to say, I was skeptical about 5G Apple was promoting it like crazy two or three events.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.600]   But now they are.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:54.160]   I'm on T-Mobile. I have family members on Verizon. In both cases, that mid-band 5G is becoming
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.680]   more and more available. It really is fast. It's 100 megabits, 150 megabits. It's as fast as you'd
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.200]   ever want. It's certainly as fast as your home network for a lot of people faster.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:10.000]   Mike, I want to follow on what you said though, because you're traveling around the world.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.200]   I believe it in the US that people were affluent, more affluent country, they're buying more iPhones.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   But that's not the case around the world. Android is still dominant around the world.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:34.160]   Absolutely. There's been a flurry of analysts' charts showing what percentage of your annual
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:43.600]   income you have to spend to buy an iPhone. In the US, it's 1.5% on average, something like that.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:50.640]   In some countries, it's 50%. Even some wealthy European countries, it's 3%, 4%, 5%.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:40:01.520]   You really don't see the uptick for iPhones abroad here in Spain. You see them, but it's not
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:11.840]   like in the US. They're a relative rarity. It's purely a cost thing. They're pretty cheap in the
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:18.000]   US. I think the only other countries that are cheaper are Luxembourg as a percentage of income.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.360]   Countries like that. This is an I/O statistic.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   US is 1.84% of your annual income. But you go to Nigeria at the top, 69.12%. Of course,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.080]   nobody's going to buy an iPhone 14. There's no way you would do that unless you're a very wealthy
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:47.680]   Nigerian. The global market really belongs to Android. There's also a big difference in markets
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:54.800]   outside the US of the percentage of people that have a pre-pay contract versus a monthly contract.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Once you go to pre-pay, you don't have all the advantages of paying instalments and discounts,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:09.200]   because they can't lock you in. That is obviously favoring more aggressive price
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.880]   and Android phones. There's also more variety outside of the US. I always get depressed whenever
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:22.160]   I go over to NWC in Barcelona and see all the other manufacturers. I remember when I lived in the UK,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:31.760]   there's much more variety of brands and models and price points that there is in the US. That's
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:39.040]   always been the case. That's the carriers also, because the carriers here really push certain
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:45.040]   brands. They push the big flagship phones. They make more money on them. I think you walk in the
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.880]   door at any carrier store, you're probably going to be offered an iPhone first. I was really
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.600]   curious by Mike's comment about Luxembourg. I just did a little bit of research.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:01.920]   I'm doing the research. That's good. I'm an American. Most of my knowledge of your
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:08.000]   upcoming Serma Crusader Kings III. Here we are. Luxembourg's population is 632,000.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.160]   Here in the United States, we mock several states for being essentially blips, Rhode Island, Wyoming,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.880]   etc. Rhode Island has way more population than the whole country of Luxembourg. I'm going to
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:28.560]   walk around with my... How straight? There you go. Thank you. 80% of those are EU government people.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.080]   Is that really who lives in Luxembourg? Interesting. It is. It's a bigger employer.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:43.840]   Their economy is really skews toward big dollar financial companies. It's true, there are
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.720]   neighborhoods in Los Angeles that are bigger than Luxembourg.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:53.440]   Shout out Luxembourg, though. Can I get like six people on a goat and
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.280]   form my own country and join the EU? Because apparently the standards are low population-wise.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.880]   This should be a high-year-old country. I am going to get emailed from
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:06.560]   Luxembourgians now who are going to be pissed to you. That's fine. What language is it?
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.640]   It's a lovely country, though. I've never been to... Where is it French? Is it French language?
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:16.560]   French language. I'm sure it's gorgeous. It's actually all in the country. It's a duchy.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.080]   So let's get that straight. It's very duchy.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:27.920]   Surrounded by Belgium, France, and Germany, that's where the Ardennes forests, the rocky
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:34.800]   gorges of the Moulertal region and the Mosel River Valley. Oh, it's near Brussels. That's why it's
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   EU. How did the shout-out on one of the cheats and I thoughts? Here's Google's offering me.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.120]   This people also ask, "How did Luxembourg get so rich?"
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.720]   Well, the European Union apparently is pouring money in there via bureaucrats.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:57.520]   Yeah, at a favorable tax regime. I'm moving to Luxembourg. It sounds nice. This sounds good.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.120]   And cheap iPhones, too. There you go. Well, no, the iPhones cost the same, but they're
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.560]   there as a percentage of your income. They're cheap. All right, let's take a little break.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.360]   Wow, I have learned so much in this show. This is fantastic. Carolina,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.280]   Mina Nancy is here. She is an analyst and clearly knows of which she speaks. I want to ask you a
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.600]   little bit about the Apple event when we come back and just the experience of being back in
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:28.000]   the Steve Jobs Theatre. Alex Wilhelm, also here. He's editor in chief of the new Tech Crunch Plus,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.920]   which you launched, right? I joined six or eight months after it came out. But I've been working
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.960]   on it since late 2019. Nice. Does the ghost of Mike Errington haunt the halls there?
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   You know, we've been bought and sold by so many megacorps TechCrunch over the years that I think
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.200]   we've had to reinvent our soul several times and I think it's gotten better over time. Who owns
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:57.840]   Tech Crunch? Currently, we are part of Yahoo, which is the former Verizon Media Group, which was formed
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:03.280]   out of the collision of Yahoo and AOL, the back when it was called OTH under Verizon.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:10.000]   And now we're owned by Apollo, which is a private equity group. Yes. Okay. So really, almost all
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.240]   the tech publications now are owned either by a public equity, either Red Ventures or Apollo,
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.560]   right? Yes. Yes. This is why substacks still always no matter how much they make me mad,
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.720]   we'll have a place in my heart for building an indie place for people to scribble.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.000]   Yeah. Speaking of indies, we have our favorite scribbler, our Gastronomad,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.560]   Mr. Mike Elgin is here in Barcelona, actually, C-Chase, just outside of Barcelona this week,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   on his way to Morocco. And you still write for the tech press, but you're freelancers.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:49.760]   You don't have to worry about that equity. Right. I've been writing for some of the usual suspects.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.400]   I've added a couple new folks. And I also love substacks. So, substack has been Betty Betty good
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:02.240]   to me. And yeah, I have a lot of fun writing on that for the same reasons that Alex pointed out.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:07.840]   So yes, it's great. It's great to be a freelancer and have a diversified income streams and all
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:14.160]   that stuff. Really, really enjoy it. So you moved Mike's list to substack win. Two years ago.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:22.720]   Wow. Okay. Yeah. So, and that was a good move. Yes. Very good. Nice. I mean, Mike's list is a
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:30.240]   bad idea in general for New Zealand because it's so hard and the end result, most of it is so
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.600]   frivolous. I read a serious piece and then I have a bunch of like funny stuff. And the funny stuff
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:42.480]   is so hard to do. It is totally not worth it. But I mean, it's worth it because I personally enjoy
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:51.600]   it. But as a, you know, as a as a effort to impact ratio, it's it's a little off the charts. But I
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   love it. We're glad you do it. I appreciate it. You still do Mike's nice list, right? Or Mike's
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:03.120]   nice photos. What is it called the Mike's? It's called the nice book. Nice book. Yes. And I
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.880]   occasionally dip in there and add some fresh things. It's a replacement for Facebook.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:15.040]   It's a nice Facebook. What I'm trying to do is Google Photos. And so, yeah, it's it's it's good. I
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:21.280]   there there's I've got a few hundred people who follow it regularly. And yeah, it's it's pretty
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.360]   great. This is all my personal photos and stuff. This is the place to go to visit
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:34.000]   all the various places Mike visits now. Yes. And do you miss do you miss Google Photos at all? I mean,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.840]   Facebook at all? Not at all. I they actually this is kind of an interesting thing. They they
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.920]   actually locked me out. So I was going to do the thing where once a year you're going and
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.080]   reactivate your account, that deactivate it, just keep ownership up. They got tired of that. They
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:57.440]   just like locked me out. And so we're on to your game, Mike. So now I'm just like, forget it. I don't
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.920]   miss it. You know, I don't miss it. Although I was at a dinner last night where four people,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.520]   I was the only one not on Facebook. And they were all talking about how fun it is. And I felt a
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:13.600]   little left out, I have to say. Yeah. Well, one of my favorite Facebook. Pardon me?
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:20.400]   I do have a special Facebook that is fun. No, I guess that was my I should ask them. What do you
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:28.960]   mean fun? Really funny. There's a subreddit that sort of mocks pseudoscience and like, you know,
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   outrageous claims flat earth. There's all this kind of stuff. And it's called Facebook science.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:40.480]   That's the name of the suburb. I'm following it right now. It sounds like a good a very good name.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:48.960]   Let me do slash r slash Facebook science. Oh, I forgot the last I put the slash in the wrong spot.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:55.440]   We're gonna take a little break, come back with more with our fabulous panel. But first,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:02.640]   a word from noom. One of the people we were at dinner with last night. I didn't recognize.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:08.800]   I hadn't seen him because of COVID. I saw him maybe two years ago. And I he went on our cruise.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.280]   And and I messaged him. I said, I thought you were going on the cruise. I don't see you. He said,
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:19.440]   I'm right here. He lost 60 pounds. He shaved his beard too. But he lost 60 pounds. And he said,
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:26.240]   how did you do that? He said, noom to which Lisa my wife said, I love noom. And I said, I love noom
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   to noom. Our sponsor for this segment of this weekend tech is a great way not to diet, but to
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:40.960]   understand why you eat how you eat. And so that you can eat more healthily when we decide to lose
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:46.880]   weight. It shouldn't just be about a number on the scale. It should be about learning to eat
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:54.400]   right and noom's psychology first approach focuses on that they empower you to build a more
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:00.960]   sustainable habit of relationship with food that has lasting results to date. And it really works
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.880]   it worked for me. I lost 20 pounds. Lisa didn't have as much to lose, but she's kept it off. She's
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:11.120]   at the lowest weight. She's been in 30 years. Noom weight has helped more than 3.6 million people
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:17.920]   lose weight. But every one of us is different. And that's what's so great about noom. Your daily
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.880]   lessons are personalized to you and your goals. The program is based on scientific principles,
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:28.400]   things like CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, which really is about helping you understand your
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:34.000]   relationship with food. Thanks to Noom, I realized that, you know, I ate pretty well when I was paying
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.040]   attention. It was the fog eating that was getting me. I wasn't almost wasn't even aware of it. I'd
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:45.200]   come home and I'd stuff some food in my mouth because I was hungry or tired or tense or stressed.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:53.040]   And it was that extra cow those extra calories that were putting me over the top. Noom does not say
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.320]   you can or can't eat any particular foods. And I really liked that too. In fact, early on in Noom,
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:03.120]   you know, you get with Noom, you get you get the app, you track your food, you have your
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.640]   lessons in there, the little readings, and you can set it to be as many minutes a day as you
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.600]   want just a few minutes or I think it's no more than 15 minutes a day of reading. But you also get
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:17.440]   a counselor and you also get a group that you can cooperate, you know, work towards goals with
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.320]   and things like that. I told my counselor, it was in the first maybe a couple of weeks of Noom.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.880]   I feel terrible. I eat a hot dog. She said, what's wrong with that? No, no bad foods.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.720]   Just, you know, keep on keep on doing it. What you're doing.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:38.160]   It's a non restrictive food program that focuses on progress, not perfection. You choose what
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.120]   support you want from five minute daily check ins to personal coaching. Off days are totally
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.200]   okay. In fact, as I progressed through Noom, they started bonusing me was so great. They say,
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.760]   okay, you could do anything you want today. It's a bonus day. But the funny thing is,
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.640]   even though I had the freedom of eat all the junk I wanted, because I've been doing Noom,
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.520]   I kind of had this awareness of what I was eating and I didn't go wild. It was kind of nice to know
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.120]   I could have if I want. Noom weight helps you get back on track no matter what happens. 95% of
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.200]   customers say Noom weight is a good long term solution. Lisa has been on maintenance for a year
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.240]   and it's really still working for her. She's she's still active. It's very interesting. She's
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:22.720]   I'm kind of impressed. They published more than 30 peer reviewed scientific articles to show users
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.600]   other practitioners, scientists, the public about what they're doing and how it works and why it works.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.520]   It has totally changed my relationship with food. I'm much more conscious when I eat. One of the
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.440]   things I learned from Noom, Lisa and I both do it. We put our phones away. We turn off the TV. We
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.520]   sit down. We chew when we enjoy our food. We taste it. We sometimes we close our eyes while we're
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.560]   eating it and makes a huge difference. Stay focused on what's important to you with Noom weight's

[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.200]   Noom. For all you've done for us, we really appreciate it. Thanks for supporting this week.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:14.160]   In tech, I'm pressing the join button on Facebook science. If I can't be on Facebook,
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:19.440]   at least I can be on Facebook science, right? At least have the worst part of the music.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:25.360]   You mean the best part because out of context, it's comedy. In context, it's terrifying. Right.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:33.200]   Right. They have 50,000 subscribers. Here we go. Look at this quarantine reduces pollution and
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:42.160]   proves flat earth. Well, there you go. There you go. This is great. This is all the stuff I've
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.600]   always wanted. I should show this on Facebook. Oh, I don't have an account. Oh, well. Oh, well.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:57.280]   So other big news, little guy, his name is Dylan, lived up the road a bit. I grew up in Sonoma County.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.360]   He's 30 years old now. When he was about three, the family bought him a computer. He really took
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.800]   to it. He loved it. Wasn't a great student. It wasn't until he got in that first robotics
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:14.560]   program in high school that he kind of really thought about technology. This is really cool.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:24.400]   He couldn't get into Cal. He didn't have great grades in school. He did get into Brown University.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.360]   I'm not sure how, but he got into Brown University. So he went there. You may remember a few years ago,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:37.600]   a guy named Peter Teal, who had a little bit of money because Peter Teal was an early investor
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.760]   in Facebook. Do you remember this? Mike, you probably had about 2012. Teal put together a
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.160]   fun saying, if you drop out of college, I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars. Yes. And the
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   HBO Silicon Valley series mocked that as well. They had a character in here there who was
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:00.240]   VC. He was like, no, don't go to college. Stair will idea. Yeah. That was ill advised.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:06.480]   So Dylan took the money. He was in his junior year at Brown. And with a friend of his also at
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:12.880]   Brown, they started a little company. Their first idea was drones to monitor traffic laws
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:19.040]   flopped. So they thought, what else could we do? And they thought, well, you know, maybe there's
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.520]   not maybe there's not a business here. I don't know. But you know, we got we got a little money. Let's,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:31.440]   let's design a web based graphics design program. They called it Figma, a design platform for teams
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:37.760]   who build products together. Didn't make a lot of money at first. They were in a above a gas
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:43.600]   station, a small office. I'm sorry, above a bar, a small office who got so noisy after three o'clock
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.480]   on Fridays, they had all had to go home because the bar was just too loud to get any work done.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.600]   Until a few years ago, he was, you know, living in the Mission District in San Francisco,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.280]   buying $1 cup of coffees on his way to work, working really hard. But it things started to turn
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.800]   about four years ago. They were able to raise money, enough money, in fact, to value the company.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.760]   I think at about $100 million. Which good money, right?
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:21.360]   Then a few years after that, it continued, I think, because of mostly because of COVID.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:29.040]   Yeah, they had a valuation around, they got them to wow, $10 billion. Still, you know, a lot of
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.680]   times founders raised this money, but doesn't mean they're going to live a lavish lifestyle.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.840]   But that was good. And that COVID really helped this little design company do very well.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:43.440]   Adobe started to notice because this company started to take money out of Adobe's pockets. In
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.720]   fact, last year, $400 million in revenue. And you have to think that most of that money that went to
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:56.960]   Figma was money that Adobe didn't make on Photoshop and Illustrator and InDesign. So Adobe started
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:01.840]   to think, well, we got to do something about this guy. This week, Adobe announced they're buying
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:09.760]   Dillon Fields company for $20 billion. One of the largest acquisitions, I think the largest acquisition
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:17.360]   of a web company ever, he has 10%. He's got $2 billion, half of it in cash, half of it in Adobe
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:23.520]   stock. That's too bad about the Adobe stock part, because Adobe stock tanked as a result.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:29.600]   But this is one of those stories where, you know what, this guy did all right. And I'm kind of happy.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:33.440]   Now, it's not a done deal. They still have to get through regulator approval and all that.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:41.520]   It'll probably go through. And timing is everything because basically, the reason I'm certain,
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.400]   the reason that Adobe really wants this company is that right now with remote work,
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:53.280]   with digital nomads, many of whom are digital creators and designers, and with the need to
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:58:01.840]   collaborate in the cloud like this offering enables, that's where it's at. Adobe is nowhere in that
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:09.280]   space. And so Adobe is still kind of living in the past of when everybody shows up to an office.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:16.320]   And those days are over, essentially, for many, many creators. And so, this is a golden idea.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.560]   Just it's one of those ideas that's exactly the right idea at exactly the right time.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:25.840]   And they are really, you know, it's really paying off for this guy.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.880]   Certainly better than drones to monitor reckless driving.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.520]   I think that was a good one. It's funny to remember Bill Gates's first
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:41.840]   travel data. But if there had been drones, maybe it had been drone related traffic.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.400]   So the market really didn't like this. I think Adobe's stock went down something like 17%.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:54.320]   But in a way, you know, look, I don't like the subscription model. I've found other programs
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:02.160]   to use in Photoshop and Lightroom. But Adobe had to do that. They had to move from the boxed software
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:07.760]   to subscription as much as people didn't like it. And I think as much as people don't like the
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:13.280]   idea of them buying Figma, they probably it's probably an existential crisis for them. You think,
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.560]   Terri, acquisitions is what Adobe does best. If you recall Photoshop was an acquisition.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:18.960]   That's true.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.360]   I think what the market didn't like is the evaluation, not necessarily the purchase.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.200]   Twenty billion dollars.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:36.080]   Yeah. I think that, you know, and they waited, say, six months as people settle into a more
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:43.200]   hybrid versus remote workplace, that evaluation could have been lower. I think that's what people
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:51.440]   are taking, you know, a negative kind of take on the deal versus whether or not Adobe is doing
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:56.160]   the right thing. Because aside from what Mike was saying about, you know, hybrid work is here to
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:04.560]   stay, it is also true that we all are more creators than we were before, right? Content has become
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:12.480]   part of what you need to come up with no matter what job you have as a knowledge worker, right?
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:19.920]   And I think that's the other trend that we see that I think Adobe is taking, you know,
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:27.760]   is looking at taking a chunk out and not to have special skills. So you don't have to necessarily
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:35.200]   have people dedicated to, I don't know, coming up with social media designs for your ads or your
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:41.840]   post or, you know, coming up with infographic for a new report that you've done. You know,
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:50.080]   all of that is now part of, you know, a writer's job or especially for smaller companies where
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.560]   you don't necessarily have dedicated people doing that. It really is perfect timing. You couldn't,
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.520]   you know, this is a company that benefited hugely from COVID.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:11.120]   But do you think that Adobe had to do this, Mike? Well, I do. I don't think Adobe has it in them
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:18.240]   to create something that would be just like this and do it quickly enough. Or I'm not even sure
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.200]   they could ever do it exactly like this is pretty lean company. And it's a pretty, you know,
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.640]   it's got a lot, it gets a lot of praise for its usability and its user interface and so on.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:37.040]   Now, I suspect that the reason that the market isn't thrilled is that they don't trust Adobe
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.680]   to own this company in the right way. They're saying all the right things. They saying we're
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.840]   going to keep it completely separate. We're going to keep the team in place. We're not going to change
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.760]   anything. We're not going to change the pricing. We're not going to do any of that stuff. But
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.800]   whenever a company acquires another company, they always say those sorts of things. And they might
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:05.040]   stick to it for a year or two in two years. This guy is going to probably leave and start another
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:11.920]   company. His contract will be up. And after a year or two or three years, the promises,
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.960]   the mindset that they had when they made the acquisition is all gone. And they will use this,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:25.440]   the people, the technology, the customers and all that stuff in whatever way suits Adobe's interests
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.000]   and their shareholders and so on. So, you know, the fact that they're saying they're going to keep
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.520]   the pricing, okay, they may or may not. They probably won't. In a few years, they'll probably jack
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:42.400]   it up and make it expensive like every other Adobe product. They may move to Adobe-like payment,
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:50.160]   you know, subscription models and so on. But for the time being, it's, I think it's a good move for
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:59.600]   Adobe simply because this is where the world is. And it very well could be that this product could
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:07.760]   become Adobe's flagship product in five years. It's possible. Time will tell. Now, the best
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:14.560]   case scenario is they do a lot of integration so that Adobe tools work seamlessly within this
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:21.760]   environment. And that would be great. But I think it's good for everyone involved. I think it's
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:28.240]   likely that the regulators will allow to go through. And, you know, I think it's kind of, the only
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.760]   downside is a lot of the customers for Figma. One of the things they loved about it was that it was
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:40.320]   like that. It was not Adobe. It was not Adobe. Yeah. Exactly. They were almost certainly refugees
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.280]   from Adobe, right? Yes, exactly. So it's a bummer for those people. Well, is that good for Canva and
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:57.120]   Sketch and the other companies in the same arena? I guess. I mean, who knows? The number of alternatives
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:03.680]   is sort of narrowing. Yeah. So. And let me ask you, Alex, is it a good because you cover business?
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:13.280]   It's OK. So 20 billion dollars. That's a kind of a significant amount of money for a company that
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   only has four and a half billion in revenue last quarter. That's more than their annual revenue.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:31.280]   Furthermore, it's a lot more than Figma makes. It's a R.R. last year was 400 million, as I said.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:38.560]   It takes a lot of 400 million to get to 20 billion. It absolutely does. But I don't think
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.840]   you should think about that in those terms. I don't think revenue is the number you want to use in
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.920]   this case. And I say that as someone who's a huge fan of using revenue multiples to value
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.600]   companies. Yeah. Yeah. Multiple of a beta. But this is a multiple. I can't remember. I saw the
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:59.120]   number like 50 X. It's a 50 X. A R R for the end of Adobe's fiscal year, which ends November 30th.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:05.360]   But what matters here more is Adobe bet roughly 13, 14 percent of its market cap on Figma. Huge.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:11.120]   Because it was worth like 170. It's been sold for its buying for 20. To me, that is actually a
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.840]   pretty reasonable chunk of the company to bet on something that could become the sort of threat
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:21.840]   that Mike's describing. And the thing that's been stressed to me by folks in the space is that it
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:28.480]   isn't like Figma was out to immediately cannibalize all of Adobe's revenues. But instead, because it
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.560]   was designed to be worked on in a collaborative environment and had a fundamentally different
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.520]   architecture than Adobe product which are designed for a single person use. And so Adobe needed
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.440]   something for the future and a defensive capacity. And critically, Figma is casual or positive. So
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.240]   once you buy it, it doesn't continue to leech from your cash flow. And I think that is a pretty
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.720]   important distinction. And it's growing at about 100 percent per year. So 100 percent per year growth,
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.680]   sure, it's expensive. But you're only betting 13, 14 percent of the company. I think it's a great
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.880]   move. I think investors are being morons. I love it. I think you're a point. I like to say that.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:07.280]   It's defensive, right? I mean, go ahead, Caroline. No, I was just going to say the point that Alex
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:12.240]   just made about the back end. And now that is organized for true collaboration. I think
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:20.320]   it's critical, right? Because that might actually well be the one of the reasons for Adobe
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:26.160]   acquisition because they can take then their products as well, a use of the same back end,
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.760]   presumably, or parts of it to deploy that for better collaboration, even on their products.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.520]   Because this is the when we talk hybrid work, everybody gets fixed on the you're in the office,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.560]   you're at home. That's not really what it is. The hybrid work is how you work and how much more
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:48.800]   in the cloud our workflows are. And this is not going away, right? So for Adobe to get
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:55.840]   to be part of that, to empower people to truly collaborate in this new environment,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.280]   I think this shit seems like a very good shortcut.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:06.480]   Yeah. The sad thing, though, Carolina, is that I think it's a smart deal from Adobe's perspective,
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.880]   right? Like to me, they had to pay a premium on the lost private valuation. We all expected to go
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.280]   for relatively high amount given the quality of the business itself, etc. But I bummed that
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   Figma didn't turn them down and try to kill them because the whole point of startups,
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:26.160]   like why I care about them, why I watch these little baby companies is because they potentially
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:31.440]   grew up to become incumbent killers. And in this case, Adobe used historically-horted wealth,
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.400]   which is fine, it's corporation, to essentially buy out the competition. And so we're not going to
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.200]   see Adobe get superseded. We're going to see Adobe more entrenched. And that just
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.600]   makes me consider that one reason, Lena Khan and the FTC may stop this.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:53.040]   They're looking at Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. Same thing to kill a rival.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.680]   And they're wishing they could roll that back. They're wishing they had looked at it a little
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.800]   bit more closely when it happened for a bill. It was a billion. I remember we were
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:08.320]   going away, a gassed at $1 billion. So do you think this new regulatory
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:14.880]   attitude in Washington might stop this for that reason alone? Because it is about to put a competitor
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.920]   out of business? Yeah, the only thing I'll say is here, and I know Mike has a strong opinion. I
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.200]   want to get his take on why he's so positive on the deal going through. But the reason why I
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:32.480]   would be in that direction is that no one talks about Adobe in Washington. If you read transcripts
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.640]   of congressional hearings and so forth, it's the big five American companies and TikTok.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:42.560]   And I don't recall Adobe coming up once. It's kind of a side show, because it's not a platform
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.160]   in the operating system sense. It doesn't have a social network that politicians can
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.000]   grandstand against. And so it kind of sits to the side and does its thing. So maybe Lena Khan will
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   keep her fire focused somewhere else. And if she does, then it goes through. I never thought I'd be
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.560]   voting for an opinion here, but I hope she does block it because then Figmo had to go in because
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.520]   that way, and it'd make me happier. Figmo was poised to do an IPO and decline because of the
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:15.200]   bad environment for tech IPOs. Give it 12 months. It's fine. I only know Dylan a teeny little bit.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.800]   I had dinner sitting next to him at Sequoia once, I think. He was a different venture capital
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.320]   firm, one of them. And he was over the ages ago. And he was perfectly lovely. But I just want to
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.120]   say one last thing before I hand off to Mike to talk about the deal. But like, I live very much
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:35.760]   near Brown University and Providence is claiming this one is ours. So does my town come up in the
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:42.000]   news press? Here we are. And take that, Cal. It turned him down, Cal. He was, we should point out,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.640]   a Brown University dropout, however. Oh, of course enough. He showed up here for a bet. He's had
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.000]   the coffee. It's fine. Just as I'm a Yale dropout. And I don't think New Haven's welcoming me back
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.360]   head with open arms. But anyway, the people who are really celebrating on San Hill Road,
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.680]   index ventures, gray lock partners and KP, those are the big VCs. I'm sure Peter Teal still has a
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.280]   pretty big stake. They will all have a giant payday. And of course, Dylan himself now in the
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:16.160]   three comma club. So Mike, you have an opinion about this? I just I want to
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.680]   to support what Alex said, which is that basically,
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.480]   antitrust, big, big antitrust action, big moves like blocking an acquisition like this
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.760]   has become political. And I don't think Washington has the understanding to
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.600]   basically is kind of arbitrary to a certain extent, what they block. And they tend to go out for the
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.840]   big, the big name of social networks and the big tech giants. And they don't, they barely know
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:54.800]   who Adobe is. They don't really care that much. There's no constituents demanding that they,
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.360]   you know, stop their steamrolling of the industry. Nobody really cares about this.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.680]   And so I think it's just going to go through simply because they want to pick their battles
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.160]   and the battles that they want to have are with Apple, Google, etc.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:16.960]   Bigger fish to fry. It was only nine months ago that Dylan Field, the new newly minted billionaire,
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.080]   tweeted, our goal is to be Figma, not Adobe.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:29.520]   You know, and that is such a that is such a soft statement to say against a competitor. He
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.840]   probably had in the back of his mind at all times that this could be a significant possibility.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:41.520]   And so, you know, even after the acquisition, even during the announcement, both they and Adobe
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.480]   are saying they're we're going to keep their independent cultures. They're essentially saying
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:53.200]   exactly what that tweet said. And so it was really, you know, the press is making that tweet sound
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:12:00.240]   like it's a, you know, shot over Adobe's bow in the past. It's nothing of the kind. It's a very,
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.000]   very anodyne, a harmless thing to say. There's also, I've also heard it said that you don't want
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.800]   the government to block this one because, and I'm sure this is a venture capitalist who said this,
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:17.920]   you really want to have people have that opportunity for the big exit because that gets more people
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.640]   to do startups. You think that's fair? I think that's baloney and annoying.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.560]   Go public. Make your own exit. Again, I agree. You don't have to sell to an aging giant that
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:34.080]   barely pulled off a SaaS transition to have the Silicon Valley model work. In fact, that's not how
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.840]   the majority of the wealth was made in Silicon Valley is made via IP as a companies that ended
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.440]   up becoming new giants, not selling out for a smaller dollar amount than you could in another
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.160]   two or four years. Not that I blame Dylan for collecting the bag to be clear. Like, shout out,
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.440]   if someone offered me $20 billion, I would sell like kids. It's pretty hard. Both of them. Yeah,
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.560]   it's pretty hard to turn that down. Even if you think, well, I might make more
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.360]   next year. I know that's hard to say no to. I don't work. I want to work.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:09.760]   Graylock and KP are kind of Dylan. We'll be very happy if you would accept that, right?
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.640]   But this is what Silicon Valley has become much more short-term. They all want the next thing,
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.880]   and they don't have a lot of patience for the current thing. This is true of Dylan.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.520]   Like I said, in a couple of years, two or three years, he's going to have another
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.560]   startup that he wants to be a hot startup. Then, of course, all the venture money
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.400]   wants to just turn that around. This is a big, big payoff for them, bigger than they probably
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:38.720]   expected. They want to take that money and invest in the next such thing, and they want to accelerate,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:45.520]   accelerate, accelerate. The days in which a bunch of engineers
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:54.160]   leave Fairchild semiconductor and found Intel, that world has been transformed into a much
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:02.000]   faster, much shorter-term thinking culture at the same time because of that culture,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.680]   because it's toxic. There are lots of new entrepreneurs who are trying to avoid VC,
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.720]   and are trying to bootstrap their operations, make revenue right away. This was almost one of
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.320]   them because they're actually not like Uber or something like that, just burning cash. They
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.880]   were actually making money. A lot of companies are trying to do that without the VC pressure.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.800]   The VCs are pushing for this sort of exit, and somebody like Dylan is probably pushing for this
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:36.640]   kind of exit. It's a bummer for all the legions of fans of this platform and also the employees
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.320]   of this company who are kind of missionaries. They've really been on a mission to
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:50.640]   change how digital collaborative work happens. It's kind of a bummer for them, to a certain extent.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   But this is how Silicon Valley works. This is the best case now scenario for Silicon Valley.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:03.040]   This is Silicon Valley working the way most people who are serious players in Silicon Valley
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.320]   wanted to work. Figma was a huge success in terms of market share. They had 77%
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.480]   market penetration for product design tools. That's got to be what's scared Adobe. Adobe had a
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.720]   competing product, Adobe XD, which really hadn't gained the same kind of traction.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.360]   It must have scared them that they could get their lunch eaten. I know a lot of designers
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:34.320]   who are very unsettled by this, who love Figma, hate Adobe and are not happy about it.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:42.400]   It was a very Facebook like acquisition where they had a really hot competitor upstart
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:50.960]   who they tried to compete against failed. They just bought them. This is the Facebook playbook.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.200]   They copy the rival. When that doesn't work, they buy them.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.960]   Hunter Walk, who's a smart seed capital of VC,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:07.200]   pointed out that when crews got snapped up by GM six years ago, people said a billion plus
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.720]   wow. But the answer was the same as with this acquisition of autonomy is the potential future
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.400]   of your auto industry. You're not strong in that area. What percent of your market cap is it worth
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.920]   to acquire? What could be the thing that's going to put the nail in your coffin?
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:34.240]   For GM, it was 2.5% of their market cap. It's even bigger for Adobe. I think it is an existential
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.960]   crisis for Adobe. Can I just wait here quickly? Hunter Walk is a friend of mine and a really
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.080]   lovely human. It's fun to see him crop up on Twitch. Rare is the time in which that part of my
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:51.120]   work life ends up on the show. I want to say one thing about the acquisition and how it's been
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:57.520]   structured. I just double checked this. According to Adobe, Dylan's going to say the CEO of Figma,
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:04.960]   but he's going to report to David Wadwani, who is the president of Adobe's digital media business.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:14.320]   He's not reporting to the CEO. Is that what's up? Yeah, I said the same. It's not reporting to a CEO.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.360]   So what does that mean? If you want me to play for the JV team, he's down an entire
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.280]   layer of management, which is no freaking joke at a big company. I currently can back me up here
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.080]   or not. But when I read that, I was just perplexed. Why do you spend as much of your market cap and
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.360]   then put it underneath a lieutenant? Why doesn't it report to the actual boss? I think it could be.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.000]   Especially if you're saying that they're going to stay independent and basically you want them to
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.160]   continue to operate the way that they have been. You can only do that if you go the CEO back in
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.480]   you. That's a clear signal. They're not that they're going to put Dylan up on the roof having
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:55.440]   lunch with the other guys. They're going to suck Figma into the creative cloud. That's that.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.640]   And Dylan, I hope you enjoy your three-year handcuffs. The problem is, I'm sure Dylan,
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.400]   he's 30 years old. He's a young guy. He thinks, "Oh, I can do it again." The case of people actually
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:14.560]   doing that is the numbers of the, I think it's pretty low. Their timing is so impeccable.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.760]   You came up with the right idea at the exact right time. It couldn't have worked better.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.800]   The chances of that happening, that's like lightning in a bottle, right? Or no?
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:32.320]   Well, you're right. You're right that it's rare to have another mega hit. But he also has the leisure
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.160]   to pursue his passions and remain a billionaire. He might want to go back to the drone thing.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:44.720]   America's Cup yachts or build drones. Exactly. It's big in China.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:51.680]   If you look at the money that the Wii Works CEO is getting out of their mess.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:19:00.480]   Yes, that's stunning. So here's a guy, I mean, all I know about Wii Work I learned from the HBO
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:06.960]   or the Apple TV series when it crashed. So correct me if I'm wrong on this. But here's a guy
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:13.600]   who was a very good talker who basically had a real estate, a commercial, a rental business that
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:19.840]   he convinced people was a tech company, got massive buy-in from SunSone at SoftBank,
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:27.200]   who very foolishly, I mean, trashed his company by buying in giving Adam Newman so much money.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.680]   Eventually the guy was such a train wreck. They had to fire him, but he negotiated,
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.320]   I think a billion dollar walk away fee. Then a couple of years later after smoking a few more
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:45.760]   joints, he started buying up a commercial real estate and no, not even commercial rental properties
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:55.200]   in Florida. He just raised $350 million from Mark and Tristan to do rental, to do the Wii Work
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:01.520]   of Apartments, I guess. I just want to say that that was fine, Leo. Talk about what I'm
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:06.720]   failing up. I take exception with the smoking more joints thing as a dismissive. We're talking
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:12.160]   about Silicon Valley. I think if that's going to be a preclusion for success, everyone's fired.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:18.720]   At least he stayed married to Anne Hathaway. So you got to admire that, right? That takes some
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:25.920]   work. I don't know because of the show. Rebecca is his real wife, Anne Hathaway.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.800]   Yeah, I was like, that's not the case. That's wrong. I'm telling you when they do the story of
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.640]   Twitter, I want Jared Leto to play me. It might be a fat suit. That's okay. He's done that before.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:41.280]   But Jared did a very nice job. Was he crashed anything like the actuals? I feel like it was
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:48.480]   pretty accurate from what I remember. It was a biopic version of reality. I think
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.640]   I think that was actually a fairly sympathetic portrayal. Oh, really? You thought that was
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:04.080]   more sympathetic than he deserved? Well, yes, I do. I think it was more sympathetic than most
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.560]   people would give them only to the sun sun. Masayoshi Sun wouldn't have been so kind.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:16.640]   I sure. The worst part about the Andreessen deal to me is not that they're trusting
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:25.680]   this barefoot supernova, as it were. The idea, I think, it doesn't make any sense. If you recall
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.240]   from the movie, his first idea when he was an entrepreneur college or whatever that was,
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.840]   was to have housing, sort of collective housing. He's got to do the same things.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.120]   Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's kind of a evolved version of that. And I think it's the kind of
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:46.000]   the thing that makes me nervous, it's the kind of thing that Silicon Valley people who live and
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.600]   breathe Silicon Valley, people like Mark Andreessen would think is a great idea.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:57.360]   Adults want to live in this sort of the community scenario. And I don't think they do. I don't think
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:03.440]   adults do want to live in a community. It's used to have boarding houses, remember the 20s and 30s
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:09.040]   and stuff like that. We're over that. People want their own autonomy. If they have roommates,
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:13.760]   they want to choose them and not have a company choose them for them. I just think it's a terrible
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.800]   idea. I don't think it scales. Now, the problem is that he took all that
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.400]   we work money and he owns the property. So to a certain extent, he's going to this like Ray
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.480]   Crock. He has this huge advantage because he personally owns the real estate.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:34.640]   Right. The problem is possible. The financial issue with we work is he had long-term leases
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:42.000]   on these commercial properties, his office properties. But he did not have long-term commitments
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.520]   from his tenants. And as soon as COVID hit, all of a sudden he's still got to pay the lease and
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.160]   he's got no revenue. I mean, it was a terrible business model. Maybe he learned, "Oh, I should
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.040]   own it instead. I'm not convinced it's a..." And co-housing, which is what you were talking about,
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:04.720]   was huge for I know people who did it in Silicon Valley. The idea that it's like kind of like a
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.680]   commune, but you have your own house. And this is really what people want because this is how we
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:16.400]   lived in tribal society. And what? Well, I feel like I understand kind of the...
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.240]   But the thing is in practice, same problem with communes. Mike and I have been around long enough
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.200]   to remember communes. It was a good idea in principle. But then...
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.000]   But they all fell apart. They all fell because they had other people.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.200]   Yeah. Hell is other people.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.800]   Adam Newman reinvented the HOA, a famously lovely system in which no one's jerk.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:48.640]   Oh, God, the HOA. This is the... Yeah, hard pass. Yeah. This is the condo association.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:55.440]   Yeah. It was really hard when we were looking for a place here in Georgia, actually, to get away
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:03.360]   from that because there are so many communities where the grass has to be a certain height.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:11.680]   And... That's very... That's very... That's very Atlanta. In fact, I remember driving through
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:18.720]   these suburbs of Atlanta and it's perfectly groomed. It's just... It's really interesting.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.440]   Yeah, I guess that makes sense. It's all HOA agreements.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:29.280]   People are famously jerkish in these HOA communities. You read these horror stories
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.720]   and people still move into them. I'm with Carolina. I refuse to let someone else tell me
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:38.640]   how tall my grass can be. I'm not allowed to swear on Twitch, so I'm not going to. But like,
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.560]   imagine a string of profanity about how I really burn my house down and listen to Billy Bob
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:49.200]   tell me what color it can be. Like, also, whose life is so fricking, flipping, fracking, small
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.480]   that they spend their time going around to other people's homes to tell them what to do with it.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.040]   Like, do you literally have no personality, hobby, friends, family or connections?
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:06.160]   Please. Do the human... Just go away. Carolina, did you end up in Buckhead or did you keep going out?
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.800]   We're in Marietta. Ah, that's a little nicer. A little more real, probably. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.560]   I always felt like Buckhead, I was a giant Nordstrom. Like the whole town.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:23.440]   It was just Nordstrom. It was very, very stepford wife. All right, let's take a little break. We'll
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.160]   come back with more great panel. Mike Galgan, so nice to see you. I wish I were in Barcelona with
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:34.960]   you or Fez next week. I'm so jealous. Where are your Fez and Fez? You'll be the only one. I will.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.720]   They all look at me and go, "What are you doing?" I remember those. Carolina Milanesé,
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:47.520]   who is our favorite Italian. Great to have you from the heart of tech and creative strategies. Do
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:54.000]   you go back to Italy on... I think you do, don't you on a regular basis? Not thanks to COVID, but I was
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:02.240]   there in the summer. I took my kid to Paris and then we went to see my mom, who I've not seen
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.840]   since we're beginning of COVID. And of course, as soon as I got to my mom's house, I tested positive.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.720]   Oh no. So I spent my week in Italy in my old kid bedroom. I'm so sorry. Yes. That's okay.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:22.400]   We were talking last night about the place to run for climate change. My sister's been saying,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.520]   "My sister has been trying... Apparently, if you can prove Italian ancestry,
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:34.400]   you can get a grandfather into an Italian citizenship." My sister and the people we were with were
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:40.000]   thinking about, "Maybe we should do that, pursue her Italian ancestry." And the place to go, my sister
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.520]   insists for climate change is the Lake District because you've got the Alps, you've got the lakes,
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:50.720]   the climate is perfect, and you don't have to worry about sea change. So I think my sister's
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:59.200]   headed there. It's very pretty. We're Genovese. Are you Milanese?
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:09.280]   I am, or at least part of the family is. But yeah, you know what they say about Genovese?
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:16.880]   Oh no. Should I ask what? You're like the Italian version of this cottage, who's very tight with
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:25.440]   money. I agree with that. We're very tight with money. My great grandmother had a villa in Genoa,
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:34.800]   which kept to herself. We never got to see it. Alex Wilhelm is here. He's living in my old villa
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.160]   in Providence, Rhode Island, EIC of TechCrunch. Plus it was so nice. Alex and Liza
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:47.840]   hosted me and gave me a tour of the old stomping grounds. And it was just an amazing remembrance
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:55.040]   of lost things past. I just want to add that if you're not watching The Lord of the Rings show
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.080]   on Amazon Prime, whatever it's called, rings of power, whatever, the dwarves appear to be Scottish.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:06.240]   The dwarves are Scottish. Right. Yes. The little hobbits are Irish. So they have these accents that
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:12.240]   like I'm trying to like not like very strange. It's hilarious if you like Scottish humor,
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:19.520]   which I'm a big fan. But yeah, languages are fun. Yeah. Do you like that show?
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:25.920]   I've decided just to enjoy it. Yeah, maybe that's what I should do is sit back and not.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:32.560]   I just I'm really liking the house of the dragon a lot better. The game is pretty cool.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.280]   I'm behind on that. But I both say I was such a dweeb for the first Lord of the Rings movies that I
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.840]   was showing up at like midnight showings and I owned the DVDs with all the back, you know, how they made
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.000]   me. I would think you hate this. You know, no, it's fun. It's fun. When when she when he says my
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.040]   brother's name is Isldoer, you go, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, he's I know who I know what's coming.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:02.000]   It's going to be interesting. Cast it into the fire. No, I mean, yeah. So so to me, it's it's
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.480]   lightweight. It's fun. It was way too expensive. You can tell they put a lot of money into the
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.680]   wrong things. But hey, you know what? It's Amazon's money. It's not mine. I don't care. I just want
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.440]   to be entertained. I have a billion dollars of Amazon's money. Yeah. Carolina's right. I think
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.400]   we've already funded the production of that show with our purchases. But you know, it's kind of
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:29.120]   Amazon's money and I, you know, it's fun. You know, why not? I am I have to quote Marcel
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:35.120]   Proust when I went back to visit the old house, the old man, he says, I felt myself reliving a
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:42.720]   pass which was no longer anything more than the history of another person. Oh, that's sad. But it
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:49.360]   was, you know, well, I thought I would get this, you know, freezaw of flooding memories flooding back.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:55.520]   And and I and I did, but it's your house now. It's your place. You're starting a new life there.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:00.880]   And I think it's actually kind of cool. And I'm not big on nostalgia. So that makes sense to me.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:05.760]   Especially with physical things. But I'm nostalgic for my San Francisco apartment,
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.600]   which was never much more than a couple of square feet. And I was there for eight years and I still
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.840]   have an enormous amount of affection for it, even though it was kind of a piece of crap. So,
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.400]   how's this seem a little bit different? I miss my I miss my North Beach apartment
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:25.360]   that had a bridge view. I and it was tiny. It was a studio. But yeah, yeah, I do miss those days.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.560]   It's something about living in the city. I don't think it's like that anymore. I don't know.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:35.760]   Mike Elgin, who is living in every city around the world. Alex Wilhelm, Carolina,
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.640]   Mina Nasey. We will be back with more and just a little bit. Our show today brought to you by
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:48.720]   Mint Mobile. I love you. See that the TV ads that he does for Mint Mobile. They're so good. I just
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:31:00.080]   love it. They do wireless. Right. They save you money. And I mean, I have to say, when I first heard
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:05.760]   about Mint Mobile and that was $15 a month for premium wireless service, I said that. No, come on.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.000]   There's there's an upsell somewhere. There's there's secret fees or something. I thought,
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.760]   what's the catch? But you know what? I've been using their service now for almost on my second
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:18.320]   year of Mint Mobile. And because their secret sauce is the first company to sell wireless
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:24.880]   service online, only they're cheap. They're like the Scots and the Genovese. They they're cheap.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:32.080]   They cut out the cost of retail stores. They pass along those sweet savings directly to you.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:37.200]   And I am so happy. I was able to get an iPhone SE from them for 15 bucks a month.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:44.960]   Wireless service for 15 bucks a month, 30 bucks a month, unbelievable. And you get a phone. That's
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.800]   great. So you can bring your own phone if you want. They're going to give you the best rate,
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.920]   whether you're buying for a single person or a family. In fact, at Mint family line started two
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:58.080]   lines and it isn't actually have to be your family. It could just be your friends, your roommates,
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:04.000]   your college sweetheart. All plans come with unlimited talk and text on the nation's largest
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.120]   5G network. I'll tell you now it's it's T-Mobile. So if you get great team mobile service where you
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.840]   are and you probably do because they're really doing a great job, get it for less.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:19.520]   Unlimited talk and text high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network. Look at your
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:25.440]   bill. Find out how much data you use every month. Then don't pay extra by just the data you need.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.800]   You get four gigs a month for 15 bucks. That's a lot. They do have unlimited plans.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:37.280]   You can bring your own phone. You keep your phone number if you want, port it over. Premium
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.680]   wireless service starts at 15 bucks a month. And for most people, that's all you'll ever pay.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.720]   That's an amazing deal. And if you want more, you can get more. See there it is. Four gigs for 15,
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:53.520]   10 gigs for 20, 15 gigs for 25. I think that's the one I got unlimited for 30 bucks. To get your
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:57.200]   new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month, again, just look at your bill, figure out what you need.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.880]   Don't pay for more wireless than you need. Get the plan shipped to your door for free.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:10.480]   mintmobile.com/twit. Check out the family plan. That's a great deal. Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:18.320]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at mintmobile.com/twit. They do support e-sim.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:23.680]   That is important. You're absolutely right. They do support e-sim. So if you got yourself
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.720]   one of the new iPhones that knows it has no SIM tray, no problem. In fact, that was a
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:33.760]   thank you, Mint Mobile, for your support, by the way. And everybody you support is by going to mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:40.320]   That was Carolina. One of the things that Apple kind of like the courage port, taking the
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:45.280]   headphone port out of the iPhone, taking the SIM tray out. I think a few people went,
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.400]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:56.320]   Well, the carriers, I'm sure, they went, "No, no, no, no for many, many years," because
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:04.000]   they don't like it, obviously. They prefer when people can switch easily from one carrier to an
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.720]   average. Do they? Because if I were a T-Mobile or Verizon, I wouldn't want them to,
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:13.760]   "Oh, yeah, I don't like you. I want to switch to AT&T with one push of the button." That would be
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:20.480]   scary. Right. They would prefer when you have the SIM cards. I see you. They want the SIM. Yeah.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.680]   From a security perspective, from a consumer point of view, obviously, it's much better, but
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:32.640]   it's also freeing up some space within the phone that is being used for a bigger battery
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:38.960]   or could be used for other things going forward. I know that there are some people that are concerned
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:47.280]   about traveling. If you like, "Mike is in Spain, what if you wanted to just go and get a SIM?" Well,
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:55.280]   you can't just go and get a SIM, but you can activate up to eight e-SIMs on your phone. I think it's
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:03.200]   up to two at the same time. There are ways, and I think that e-SIM is the way forward. Apple always
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:11.680]   has this strength from a negotiation perspective to really twist the carrier's arms and let them do
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:18.320]   what others have been trying to do. Because e-SIMs have been around for a long time, especially in
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:27.200]   other markets, and multiple SIMs as well. But for the US, it's one of the things that consumers
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:33.440]   don't necessarily think about too much, but in markets like Europe. You can get eight different
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:38.720]   virtual SIMs in the iPhone, I'm told, and any two can be active at once. Correct.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:44.240]   I mean, as long as the... The travel that's amazing. Yeah. If the countries you're going to
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.480]   support e-SIM, what are you doing, Mike? Is that going to be a problem? Well, I'm still on Google
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:54.800]   5, but Amira is going to be embracing the e-SIM thing. There's various servers. I've got the
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:01.600]   name of the leading e-SIM company. But basically, these e-SIM companies are about to have a really
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:08.320]   golden era because now you just go to the website, you find the country, here are all the options,
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.680]   here's the prices, it can be prepaid, it can be whatever, and you just download it. And it's
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.920]   fantastic. I mean, if you think about the user experience from fumbling around with a SIM card,
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:26.000]   some of us who are technical enthusiasts and so on, we have the little pin thing,
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.280]   you push it in and then it slides out. And then you have to know which is it this way or that way.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.520]   Normally, we would be having our traditional iPhone party this week, where I bring the poker,
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.640]   and everybody brings their iPhone, and I poke that out of line and pass it down and pass it down
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.400]   and pass it down and pass it down. And we don't have to do that this time.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:53.360]   Look at the experience you had upgrading. It was so easy. So the way I got this phone,
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.320]   the only way I could get a phone day and day was to go pick it up at the iPhone store down in
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:04.000]   Marin. So I went down to Corda Madeira and I was a little nervous because they give you a QR code
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.880]   for your appointment. You have to be there between 330 and 345 in my case. So I show up, I show the
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.480]   guy my QR code, and he says, get in line, I thought, Oh God, there's all these people ahead of me.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.800]   I timed it was eight minutes. When I bought the first iPhone, it was more than eight hours in line.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:27.760]   So eight minutes, not so bad. But here's the amazing thing. It said, okay, see your old phone.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.920]   Do you want to transfer the T mobile account from your old phone and new phone? Yep. I said,
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.160]   yeah. Said, okay, you're good. Phone calls will now start ringing on your iPhone 14.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:41.120]   It was that easy. At the Apple store, they said, yeah, at the Apple store, they said,
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.520]   would you like us to help you? It was very impressive. Yeah, it was so easy.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.560]   And I hope it's that easy. If I say, I'm going to move this over to T mobile,
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:57.280]   or, or, I mean, Mint mobile, I hope it's equally easy to do that. Yeah. You know,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.800]   but that's clearly the future. And that clearly makes way more sense than having, you know,
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:10.080]   end users, you know, swapping out for one, for one thing, you think about who is not really in
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:17.600]   position to do that. Yeah, from his unassessibility perspective, yeah, etc. Yeah, exactly. It's just a
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.600]   big problem that is very difficult to deal with. This is a situation where in the future, you can
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:30.320]   just say, you know, like, as with your case, would you like all this stuff? Yes, I would. And then now
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.520]   you have everything that your old phone used to do, including the carrier is now on your new phone.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.600]   That's the way it's going to be. That's the way it should be. Yeah.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:44.000]   And let's remember that carriers ship you out. Synchards every now and then, because they're
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.760]   not capable enough, right? You don't have enough memory. And so every now and then,
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.120]   you need to upgrade your SIM to make you pay usually $10 for the pleasure of you continue to
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.240]   pay their bills. So, you know, it wasn't really efficient. I, both Verizon
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:07.440]   and T-Mobile said, you're going to need a new SIM. This is a year or two ago to use our 5G
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.560]   networks. I thought, really? So there's something in there that says, you know, you got to be
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.800]   upgraded. So I had to go into a Verizon store and get a new SIM and all that. So that was a kind of
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.880]   pain. Now, I hate to tell you, Mike, that Morocco is not an easy does not have an easy
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:28.720]   SIM carrier. So that's going to be the problem. Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany,
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.160]   Hungary, India, Japan, Poland. But by the way, not every carrier in these countries, Romania,
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:40.800]   Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and in the US, most carriers, support
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:51.040]   e-Sims. But the quick transfer, and not quite so many, right? So just because they support it,
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:58.080]   doesn't mean it'll be as easy to do. And then there are other activation system. Look how this
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.600]   is kind of complicated. So, but it's going in the right direction. So I think, I think,
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:08.240]   you know, three, four, five years, this would be a, this would just be a nothing burger of a,
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:14.320]   of an issue. And everybody will catch up. Morocco will have them. I think, I think this is the way
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.960]   it's going to go. And it's great. I mean, the way, you know, I've been using Google 5 for a long
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.000]   time and they're, you know, they're all on regular SIMs. I don't know if an MDNO can use a,
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:31.040]   a e-SIM or not, probably can. But the great thing about Google 5, and especially now that they
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.680]   have unlimited is like, you just tell them, Hey, send me five of them and they send you five SIM
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.680]   cards. They're, they're free. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's been pretty great. So for traveling, I love
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:47.120]   five. In fact, that's why I keep a pixel six for traveling. Yeah. Yeah. We use, I have a pixel three
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:53.600]   of all things, which we use as a, a hotspot in places where, you know, we have all these devices
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:59.840]   and don't necessarily have any other connection. It works great. Mint mobile is an MVNO and they
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:05.280]   do support the SIM, our sponsor, I was just talking about. So I don't, I think MVNOs can.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.040]   Right. I mean, it's obviously up to them. They definitely can. Yeah.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.400]   I have a question about all of this because I've just been a, a Verizon customer for 1000
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.400]   years because I'm lazy and I've never really switched. They just take more of my money every year.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:27.440]   Right. Thank you very much. I mean, I'm the idiot who had a Comcast router in my apartment for
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.440]   eight years and I didn't realize I was paying like 10 bucks a month for. So like, I'm, I'm not,
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:36.480]   I'm not the smart customer here. My question is about the moved e-sems and listening to the
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:41.760]   conversation, it seems like it's easier to generally speaking swap. So does this mean that Apple is
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.840]   setting a little bit of precedent to later on free us somewhat from our locked in carrier
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.760]   contracts? Or am I misreading or perhaps being too optimistic about what this change could be
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.080]   in the long term? There was some speculation that Apple might want to be there, just like Google does
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:03.040]   have their own system. Yeah. But to me, this move seemed to eliminate
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.480]   the physical sim. That's the bigger move than the e-sem part because they already had an e-sem,
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:14.560]   they had both. But they moved to eliminate is kind of like how they eliminated floppy disks
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:19.520]   and stuff like that. Ever is that, whoa, wait, what are you doing? And so you can't imagine a world
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   without three and a half inch floppies. And Apple said, nope, floppyness is the future, floppy
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.680]   lessness. And so we're just going to cut them out. And that's what this is really all about.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.640]   They're shocking the industry with this thing saying no more sim cards. We're dying. It's over.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:43.200]   Yeah. Well, I think they're still though, because we're talking about the sim, but then we don't
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.480]   talk about the number, right? And so yes, you can switch, but there's also number portability
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:56.080]   that come into play. And I don't know the carriers have said necessarily what they're willing to do
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:01.760]   going forward when it comes to ease. So in other words, yes, I can switch. But whether or not, you
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:06.800]   know, where I'm going is going to be able to give me the same number or if I have to pay something
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.600]   in order to take the number with me as is the case today with most carriers. And floppy disks are
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:25.920]   not dead. I might add technology is take a long time to die. Didn't Japan just change from a floppy
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:32.480]   disk based document system? The government, I think. Yeah. And there was a great article,
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:37.680]   which I think we talked about on Twig, we spoke with the last person standing in the floppy disk
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:45.840]   business. This is from ion design dot a IGA dot org. This guy, nobody makes floppies anymore.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:53.040]   But this guy at floppy disk.com still sells them. He buys them at auction. He buys them on eBay.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:44:02.880]   He sells floppy disks. So if you need floppies, go to the floppy guy floppy disk.com.
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:11.840]   Really in Japan, I you know, people imagine that the government is using them to store data to,
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:18.080]   I guess, to load programs or whatever people used to do with floppies. But what's hilarious is a
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.680]   lot of Japanese government agencies require people to submit documents on floppy disks.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:31.360]   Yeah, crazy, right? The Japanese equivalent of facts here in the US.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.880]   Yeah, we're still stuck. They invented the facts. We're stuck with that too.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:41.680]   Yeah, that will never die. But I will say in 2019, the US nuclear arsenal stopped using floppy
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:47.760]   disks. It's a good point. If the army can get off a technology, we all can. Let's kill floppies.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:54.080]   Let's kill facts. Like, I mean, come on, people. What decade is this? Or really,
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.360]   what millennium this guy is floppy guy. The AI G.A. asked him, what's the most in demand?
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.600]   He says, the most of the man is a standard 1.44 megabyte, three and a half inch blank floppy disk.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:11.680]   I would say the most valuable are currently the 720 kilobyte double density disks. And of course,
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.480]   there are specially eight inch disks for which there is a very small demand in which we only
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:23.440]   have a small inventory apparently 10 or 12 years ago. He says, I bought a couple of million disks.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:31.440]   And we basically been living up that inventory ever since. Didn't Will Smith make a movie about
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:37.600]   this called the pursuit of happiness? Essentially? Hey, he's living, he's living large. He's living
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:44.000]   the life. Mr. floppy disk. Yeah, God bless him. I had, I had a zip drive. My dad has a zip drive
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.120]   in his office. I heard those coolest things. It was like a hundred megabytes on a desk. I was like,
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.880]   yeah. Now I upload like, gigabyte sound files for every podcast. Maybe that's what Japan's moving
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:59.840]   to from the floppy is the zip disk. That would be appropriate. It would be an upgrade of a sort,
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:04.160]   but you know, Dropbox is public now. I think we've all figured out how to do this without physical
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:11.280]   media. So it was the digital minister of Japan who said, you know, they haven't stopped doing it.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:17.680]   He said, we've got to stop doing it because this is crazy. There's still, according to Time
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:25.840]   Magazine, 1900 government procedures in Japan that require a floppy disk.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:35.600]   The Japan's digital minister, hey, at least they have a, I don't think we have a digital minister.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:43.440]   Unless it's that guy with the super church down in LA, Taro Kono said, we will be reviewing these
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:49.760]   practices swiftly. Why does one even buy a floppy disk these days? Well, we know now where one
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:58.160]   gets a floppy disk. Crazy. All right, I want to take a little break. Is it time? Yes, it is.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:04.240]   We have much more to talk about with our fabulous panel, but I don't want to keep them too late
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.840]   because, hey, it's Game of Thrones night, you know, we got it, we got to have our priorities.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:17.360]   So you haven't watched that yet, Alex? I have watched an episode and a half, but video games
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.680]   that you mentioned, that's a better, that's the show to watch, not the Lord of the Rings, the
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.320]   House of the Dragon. You have to pay attention in House of the Dragon and Lord of the Rings.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.800]   I'm not a little hobbits. Okay, no. So you've watched all of the Lord of the Rings.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:38.320]   No, I've watched four episodes. I think that's one I haven't seen. Okay. Okay. So
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.720]   the guy in the start, do you think that's Gandalf? So that's my hypothesis. That
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.000]   are it's Saruman, but I mean, it's one of the things that we know because we
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.800]   Oh, so you haven't gotten the most recent episode where we meet someone. Oh, no, I haven't. That's
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.680]   when I had my COVID vaccine on Friday. So yesterday, I was on the call. Spoiler alert. Yeah,
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:03.120]   I think it's a spoiler. You know the Saruman's going to show up. Who's making all the orcs?
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:10.880]   Well, I mean someone who doesn't know that Saruman Sauron. Oh, maybe Saruman. Oh,
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:16.560]   Saruman was a white wizard. He was the original white wizard in the name of his
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.120]   Gandalf to gray. He came back. He's Gandalf the white, right? I think it's Gandalf because
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.600]   remember, Gandalf has a soft spot in his heart for the hobbits. And that's right. That might be
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:31.200]   why, right? He he he also had a soft spot for the Halflings leaf, which I believe means that he's
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.840]   the next, uh, so I can buy CEO by your earlier launch. He likes to smoke smoke that to back
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:43.840]   as they say. I should. I shouldn't. I shouldn't. A little too much lower. I should. Today brought
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.240]   to you by Blue Land. You want to do the right thing. I know you want to do the right thing. We do
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:52.160]   two. We're trying to eliminate single use plastics in our house. We don't use, you know,
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.240]   plastic bags anymore. We use paper bags, all that stuff. But there is an area of single use
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.960]   plastics. It's really appalling. Did you know that an estimated five billion with a B plastic
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:09.840]   hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year and COVID we moved and moved away from
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:17.200]   the bar soap to the hand soap, but you use it up, you throw it away five billion, thrown away every
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:23.440]   year. And if that's not bad enough, most of what's being transported in those bottles is water 90%.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:32.880]   The active ingredients only 10%. So here's a better way. Blue Land, Blue Land. We now do all our
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:39.360]   squirters, all our surface cleaners, our window cleaners, laundry detergent, dish detergent,
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.240]   everything from Blue Land. Blue Land is on a mission to eliminate single use plastics
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:49.520]   by reinventing home essentials that are good for you and good for the planet. You buy the,
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:55.520]   what they call their lifetime bottles. They're beautiful forever bottles for the hands up their
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:00.400]   heavy glass so that you could squirt them. And for the surface cleaner and the window cleaner,
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:07.600]   it's light plastic, but they last forever. When you use them up, instead of throwing it away,
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.960]   they send you little tablets, like a little fizzy tablet that you throw in there, you add
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.960]   your own water. So they're not transporting all that water uselessly. And you've got a whole new
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:25.920]   bottle of this. It's so great. They smell great. They work great. And, and, and, and Blue Land's
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:32.800]   innovative tablet refill solution takes one tenth the space of a traditional bottle. So,
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:38.000]   the shipping and all of that, it's much simpler. Fill it with warm water. Refills start at just a
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.440]   couple of bucks. I'm on a subscription plan. So I get the refills when I need them. Oh, oh, oh,
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:47.200]   oh, one of the things you've got to get is the toilet cleaner tablets. You throw it in,
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.680]   you go do some other stuff and then your toilets all clean. It's amazing. Those run out fast.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:56.560]   They've got more in stock. I think Blue Land is a great idea from cleaning sprays to hands up to
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:02.880]   toilet cleaner to laundry. We use their laundry tablets, sent free laundry tablets. So, you know,
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:08.320]   that we don't know, no sensitivities, no allergies. A great, I recommend this. In fact,
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.760]   I did it for my daughter when she moved into her new apartment. Get the clean essentials kit.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:15.840]   It's a great housewarming gift. We got it to start. I said, Oh, oh, this would be good for Abby.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:21.920]   Everything you need, you get Blue Land products in refreshing signature scents like Iris agave,
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:29.120]   fresh lemon, eucalyptus mint, and they have seasonal scents. This is for the fall, they've got apple
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:35.120]   butter. Wouldn't you like to wash your hands and apple butter? Vanilla chai. That's actually a nice
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:42.240]   one and maple pumpkin. Right now you get 15% off your first order. You will feel good. It works.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:45.760]   The only thing you have to get rid of now, the only thing you have to throw away now
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:51.840]   is your notion that this, these environmentally good products are not effective. They are very
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:55.760]   effective and they are not pricey. You're going to save a lot of money because you just buy the
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:03.840]   tablets now, right? 15% off your first order. Get the whole kit. Get started at blueland.com/tuit.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.680]   I would say get the clean essentials kit. So you have all of it.
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:16.960]   Blueland.com/tuit. We thank them so much for saving the planet and for supporting Tuit.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:24.000]   And you can do the same for both by going to blueland.com/tuit. Thank you, Blue Land. I really love this
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:31.280]   stuff. We use it everywhere. How was it, by the way, Carolina at the Steve Jobs Theater because they
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:37.280]   hadn't had an indoor in-person event since before COVID? Was it a little weird?
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:48.000]   It wasn't. Everybody had to be vaccinated and prove a COVID test, a negative COVID test
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:54.960]   before being admitted. So it felt, I think it felt weird for a second just because of the amount of
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:53:00.560]   people I was around and most people, I would say 90% of people were not wearing a mask.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:06.720]   But it was so nice to see a lot of the people that I normally see at events, especially
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.960]   having been away from California for a year now. It was just a family reunion.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:21.120]   So that was nice. And compared to, so I was there for WWDC as well. And that was a bit different
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:27.200]   because it was mostly US press, whereas this time they had a lot of international press. So it was
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:36.400]   nice to see reporters from the UK and Italy that I had not seen for a while. So it was a great
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:43.040]   environment. Yeah. There will probably be another one. I don't know if you're going to fly out again,
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:49.680]   but I think it's pretty good sources are saying that it's going to be an October event.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.960]   They will have a new iPad Pro, a new iPad regular, the iPad 10, I guess it'll be.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:05.920]   They'll have new M.2 computers. Unknown. If it'll be, I'm sure there'll be laptops,
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:11.680]   but it's unknown if they'll do an iMac Pro maybe or a Mac Pro or waiting. They said they'd get a
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:15.120]   Mac Pro out this year. So all that's probably not too far off.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.280]   Whoo. Are you going to fly out again?
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:28.480]   We'll see probably. I think what is interesting is that they are clearly not moving away from the
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:35.280]   video production part of the event. So in essence, we were all sitting in the theatre watching TV.
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:44.800]   But you know, there's such a high production value in what they put together, especially
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:52.240]   if you looked at the part about the Apple Watch Ultra and talking to the different
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:55:00.800]   climbers and the divers and everything else. There was a lot there. The people that had been
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:07.840]   impacted by having a watch or an iPhone save their life in critical situations. There was a lot
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:16.800]   there that they just cannot replicate just from being on stage. I confess I bought an
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:24.400]   Ultra even though I haven't climbed a rock in a while. I probably can't run more than a couple
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:30.880]   blocks without losing my breath. And I certainly am not going underwater anytime soon, but it's a
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.520]   nice looking. Well, I even got the band that stretches over your wetsuit.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:41.520]   Like I'm going to be doing that. Is this just an aspirational purchase?
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:47.360]   But my point being, I bet you 90% of the sales of this watch are people like me, right?
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.200]   One hundred percent.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:56.640]   The truth is what you're saying, Leo, is you don't need this watch. But my universal theory of
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:02.560]   all of this consumer electronic stuff is we don't need any of it. We don't need a smartphone.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.240]   We should have a mouth. It makes us feel good. That's what Carolyn is saying.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:14.160]   It's an emotional purchase. Yes. Right. All right. I'll take Apple's side on this one. This is a
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:20.800]   rare one for me. My Apple Watch band broke. Yes. And I do not have it because I need to buy a new
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.200]   one. And I fidget with it too much. And so I break them every six months. It's just whatever.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.240]   I've been moving a lot less because I do not have the guilty
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:37.200]   and I'm definitely more. So for me, I respect Mike's perspective here and I generally agree with
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:43.200]   them. But I will say the lower tier of many of these gadgets brings base functionality. It's
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:49.280]   very useful. You wouldn't catch me. No, I agree. No, I agree. In a new Apple Watch 8 Pro Max Ultra
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:55.440]   HD, whatever. I'm not into Windows Vista branding. But I will say that the base stuff is pretty nice.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:00.160]   Well, and you would like to know retroactively when you've ovulated. I think that's important.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.320]   I mean, I just after a couple years of infatolary.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:09.280]   It's actually you. That's a good point. That's a very good point. You've been doing all of that.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:14.880]   It's a no joke. It's super useful. I thought it was really interesting and very attuned
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:20.160]   to the political mood that Apple, when they started talking about the Watch,
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:28.000]   talked about the Watch for women. It was the big segment. Well, actually, I think they did one
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.640]   better earlier because they said this is not about women issue, this is a family issue. And I so want
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:41.520]   people to really talk about whether it is about having babies or talking about abortion as a family
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:50.400]   issue both ways. It's not just about us. I appreciated that. I don't know how many people
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.880]   picked up on it, but they made the point in the presentation.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.960]   Yeah. Unfortunately, what they didn't tell us is in order to do the retroactive ovulation,
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.440]   the cycle tracking, you have to watch the watch to bed for five nights before it can
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:13.200]   measure your relative temperature. And especially on the ultra, that is not an enticing prospect.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:19.280]   It's actually super light. I don't know if you try to invest. No, I haven't tried it. No.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:27.840]   It is very, very light. I have a very small rest and I posted this video on Instagram and TikTok
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:36.800]   because it does look a little bit big on my wrist. But I was very surprised how light it was. And I
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:45.680]   think that from a design perspective, aside from the wannabe Ironman people or Ironwomen people,
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:54.160]   there is a broader market that is for women that even if it's large, and there are a lot of women
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:59:00.720]   actually that like bigger watches because they have a small rest. And so that kind of compensates.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:06.800]   It's a statement. It's a fashion statement. Yeah. And the watch is more comfortable to wear
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:12.160]   while you're sleeping than it is comfortable for the person you're sleeping with when you roll
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.080]   a walk, you just walk some of the face of big piece of my sapphings.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:22.320]   Crystal's fine. So that's all I care about. It is weird that you I mean, this is a limitation.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:26.720]   And of course, Apple is very good at these events of promoting the excitement of it.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:31.040]   And all the things it's going to do. But this is a limitation of measuring temperature on your
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:37.280]   wrist with a watch. It's relative. It's not your actual temperature. And it needs a base
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:41.520]   that's going to require five nights, at least of sleeping. It doesn't measure your temperature
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.160]   while you're awake for a variety of technical reasons. It can't. So it has to do it while you're asleep.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:52.320]   What's interesting is that the quantified self movement and separately, the smartwatch
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:58.800]   movement have been have skewed very, very male historically. But especially the quantified
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:05.840]   self movement, it's a bunch of tend to be younger men who are into that sort of thing. But this is
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:13.520]   a quantified self thing that is probably compelling for a lot of women who want to start families
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:18.800]   or just want to know what's happening with their menstrual cycles. And so I thought it was really
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:25.760]   brilliant. It was a brilliant way to combine new hardware with artificial intelligence
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:29.920]   and something that has a real world benefit, but also has this really compelling like,
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:36.400]   I want to know what's happening with my cycle. I think since the beginning of time, women have
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:41.680]   wanted to know when is one of my fertile, all that kind of stuff. So I just think it's a stroke of
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:47.280]   absolute genius for them to open with that and really emphasize it and also back it up with a
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:53.440]   product that we'll see how it actually works in real life. But this is a major, major
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:02.960]   way to sort of broaden their market by, you know, sort of like that's been dominated by
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:07.680]   men wanting to wear the smartwatches more than women and men wanting to do quantified self
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:13.520]   more than women. Now here you have a watch and a quantified self idea that's that's going to be
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.440]   really appealing to a lot of women. I believe it's really they're going to sell a lot of these
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.400]   based on that. I love what you said, Carolina, that it's not about women, it's about families.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:29.520]   And actually, I would go even farther that Apple is really positioning itself as a company that
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:37.680]   cares about its users and wants to protect its users with a crass detection, with the cycle tracking.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.640]   And let's not forget that all of the period tracking apps that you get on your iPhone and
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:50.000]   other devices, a whole lot of them leak information about information that could be hugely
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:58.080]   problematic in this post rogue world. So Apple without saying at all is really very strongly
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.040]   creating this impression that we care about you and you can trust us and we're not going to
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:11.760]   rat you out. So this is something you can use with us because it's safe and they're really
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:15.440]   pushing that. And I think that's smart of them. They've doubled down on privacy over the last
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:19.760]   few years now. And Tim Cook's always said health is going to be a very big part of our business
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:24.560]   and so it's certainly a tentpole business for them. Now it's even more. It's like,
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:32.160]   this is the company that cares about you. I think I joked in the past about how Apple is
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:38.400]   basically safe keeping his base as we all age. Yes. We started out with
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:44.000]   it's going to get the youngsters to the new youngsters. But if you have it, I was saying,
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:52.240]   if you have a teenager who is starting to drive and the iPhone is already the most popular phone
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:59.120]   in for Gen Z years, it's a no brainer that you want something that is not necessarily your
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:06.400]   insurance gizmo on your windshield, the measures whether or not you're a safe driver or not. And
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:12.240]   then they increase your premium or whatever it is that they do with the data that they collect.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.840]   Well, the bad cynical take is that they want to keep their customers alive and buying Apple.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:25.120]   That was my point. Yeah. You know, for detection, they want to get to me before I die.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.640]   I won't weigh in on whether it's I mean, it's clearly a marketing strategy. So I won't weigh in
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:36.000]   on whether it's legit. I don't know what their real intentions are. I mean, their only real job
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.120]   is to make money for their stakeholders. But it is certainly a good marketing position to say,
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.400]   hey, here's a company that's going to protect your privacy, going to protect you,
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.800]   cares about you and your health. That is a nice position to be in for any company.
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:57.520]   It's a position Google is an in. Samsung is not really effectively promoting this.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:03.280]   The problem that I have with this Apple approach is they were really big on privacy for a long
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:07.840]   time. They changed the way consumer privacy works with applications and tracking and so forth.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:12.160]   And then after they had whacked everyone else's business, right? And by the way, new ad products
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.280]   have Apple. Yeah. And so here's the thing, an ad based business, if you are a platform company,
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.480]   will lead to constant product compromises down the road. And so I'm very concerned that Apple in
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:26.640]   a search for growth, going back to the world, a new iPhone, sell better than the last one conversation,
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:31.120]   will have to essentially compromise its own principles when it comes to generating
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:36.000]   revenues, which depend on data. Totally, totally legitimate. And that's why I'm saying,
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.920]   I know it's a good marketing strategy and I don't know what their real intent is because you're
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:45.760]   exactly right. And look what it's done to Google, frankly. Google went from don't be evil to let's
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:54.240]   be as evil as you possibly can. Block ad trackers in Chrome. I mean, do everything they can to own
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:05:00.320]   the browser ecosystem and then make it impossible for people to protect their privacy in it while
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:07.120]   pretending to be private. And they took Google search. This like one of the best things humanity
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:12.320]   had ever made and turned it into a really low grade ad engine. Like if you use Google search
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:17.760]   on mobile, it's like add, add, add, it's also search for add. And then like 14 squirrels down,
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:23.040]   there's the Wikipedia page you wanted. How did they manage to become the thing that they were
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:28.800]   trying to kill? It's like ask Jeeves in 2022. It's ridiculous. Well, in fact, it was, wasn't it
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:34.640]   Larry Page who in the early days of Google said, well, you can't do ads because it'll corrupt you.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:41.600]   And and they did. And he was right. Yes. Ads used to be on the right rail and they had results
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:45.200]   in the thing. And then they're like, what do we put the ads on top? And then slowly made them
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.640]   look more like search results. It's just they're doing the constant.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:58.080]   They're doing something similar now to where they are basically this is how I this is how I
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:05.280]   frame their move to cut area 120, their research arm, basically in half, they're going to start
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:12.960]   doing that weird story. Well, this is basically, if I if I'm understanding what they're doing and why,
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:19.760]   the whole point is, well, all these little unique innovative things that we've come up with aren't
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:25.440]   making any money. So let's just double down on the stuff that is making us money today. And the AI
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:30.320]   stuff that's going to make us bank in the future. And all this stuff about experimenting and like,
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:36.240]   trying new things and throwing. There's no use for it. Here's the thing that people don't realize.
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:40.560]   I think Google has 175,000 employees or something like that. They have a ton of employees.
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:50.240]   They're currently down to under 100 in area 120. Oh, wow. So, so we're talking about 100 people
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:54.880]   out of that many employees out of all the billions that they make. And they want to cut that in half.
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:02.400]   That's how uncommitted they are now are to innovation. It's really kind of horrible. And it's,
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:08.720]   to me, it's akin to this idea of transforming Google search into it, an ad delivery system.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:14.240]   And doing it for the money, just going for the money, it seems to me that that's what they're
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:19.360]   backing off of innovation is. We know these areas, these limited areas, where we can make a ton of
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:24.640]   money. Let's just do that. Because that's what we do. We make money. The in the early days of
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:30.560]   Google, they were quite famously had the 20% time where you are expected 20% of your time one day
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:36.960]   out of the five a week to work on a passion project. That's what that's what created Gmail.
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:41.120]   That's what created maps. I mean, a lot of the best Google products came out of that
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:49.840]   area 120 model was we work on the 20% products 100% of the time. That's where 120 came from.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:55.200]   And now it's what 60% right because we're just going to cut it in half. This week, Google,
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:02.000]   it's rumored, but I believe said we're not going to do a pixel book. They asked last month the
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.760]   Google hardware laptop division. Project Loon got sped spun off. And now they're cutting 120.
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:15.840]   There are indeed arm in half. Is this what happens to late stage startups? I mean, is this
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:18.560]   kind of an inevitable part of the life cycle of a company?
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:24.720]   Oh, ah, this is a really good I've been thinking a lot about this lately because as companies
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:29.600]   reach kind of a maturity point of growth with their initial product that wins them the market for
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:36.160]   Apple, it was backs for Google, a search now alphabet, etc. They tend to have to dilute the
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:40.640]   consumer value proposition in that core business as a way to keep juicing growth,
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.320]   which is why on Google search on mobile, there's more and more ads before you get to results
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:49.520]   because they need to drive more revenue to keep their investors happy. And I know that I'm a
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:54.640]   capitalist at heart and I cover the public markets and private markets for my job. But I
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:59.200]   wonder if a lot of companies wouldn't do better if they just stayed private. It didn't have to
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:07.200]   sacrifice consumer value for shareholder value long term. Is Apple going through the same thing?
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:13.760]   Yeah, bro, they just had a whole app. I believe they announced a new camera on their phone.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:19.920]   Right. Is it the innovators dilemma? I mean, Google makes so much money in search
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:25.520]   that it stymies anything else. Initially, it funded everything else.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:34.160]   But then Sunar Pachai and their CFO Ruth Porat said, "Yeah, but we're not making much money on that
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:40.640]   other stuff. So let's just, you know, I think there's a big difference between Google and Apple
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:47.440]   that makes it hard to say they're going through the same thing. Apple has been a hardware company
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:54.080]   at heart all the way and Google has always been a software company. And yes, Apple is doing more
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:10:00.400]   in services and the revenue is moving more and more towards services and they diversifying.
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:10.240]   They also are broadening their product portfolio. And I never actually believe that Google was
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:18.960]   serious about hardware. The way that the made by Google team operates just doesn't
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:25.680]   fill me with confidence. That's why Tony Fadel left. Sorry. That's why Tony Fadel left when they
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:32.880]   bought Nest. He said, "Yeah, and if you're looking at how the Pixel team has come together,
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:40.720]   you know, kind of Motorola lens that where an HTC kind of jumped together,
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:46.800]   you know, I'm not surprised that they're getting out of the tablet and a PC.
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:54.400]   The tablet market is pretty much Apple and a little bit of Samsung and Amazon, depending
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:11:01.680]   on the markets, right? And the PC market, although it's going way better than it was before COVID,
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:05.920]   is still extremely competitive. And I just don't know that people are necessarily,
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.520]   you know, kind of creating lines waiting for a Google PC.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:17.520]   I love Rick Osterlo came over from Motorola heads their hardware division.
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:20.400]   But these days, it feels like he's beaten down.
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:28.400]   Well, the problem, I think the problem is you can't underestimate the influence of charismatic
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:36.080]   founders and what they're interested in. The Google founders, Larry and Sergey were like
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:40.880]   Elon Musk is big thinkers. Let's do something gigantic. Let's somebody come with an idea and
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.200]   say, "Yeah, what the hell? Let's do that." And so Sundar Pachay is not that kind of guy.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:50.160]   And he also is not the kind of guy who gives a rat's heiny about the consumer market. You see
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:55.680]   him slowly moving the ship of state toward enterprise, government contracts, that sort of thing,
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:01.920]   and away from consumer plays. You mentioned the cancellation of Loon.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:10.880]   Loon was originally, we were told, was going to bring the internet to remote villages
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:16.160]   around the world by reeling it from balloon to balloon and bring it to a place where they
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:19.920]   didn't wouldn't have the infrastructure on the ground. We could deliver it from the sky. This was
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:27.920]   the promise. It was a utopian idea to expand, eliminate the digital divide and expand the
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:32.880]   internet by bringing it to people in far-flung areas. Well, now what they're doing with that,
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.920]   they realize that the most valuable technology they have is the technology that
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:44.080]   used lasers to transmit data from balloon to balloon. So now they have a new startup. They spun it
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:50.720]   out as a startup called Illyria. And what this is going to do is they promise that they have this
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:57.040]   hardware technology called typing. And it's a software called SpaceTime. And basically what
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:05.120]   they're going to do is they're going to have this laser-based data communications network for space,
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:11.120]   for underwater, for all these places where you can't have physical infrastructure.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:16.320]   And what that means though is that they're really going to go after mainly government and military
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:21.120]   contracts. They're going to go after huge companies that are doing stuff in space.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:27.760]   Is it Microsoft basically doing the same thing? Yes, exactly. Microsoft is on the same long-term
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:32.640]   trajectory where they just don't succeed with consumer market. They don't want to play in that
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.600]   market. They love the big enterprise- It feels like they've lost interest in Windows. But boy,
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:45.920]   they sure love those military contracts. Yes, exactly. They salvaged their HoloLens contract
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:51.040]   with the Army. We thought that was a lost cause. But that's what they really love. They love to
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:57.600]   get together with like-minded business people. And then when they sell something,
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.760]   they sell $3 billion worth instead of just trying to slug it out with the whole world in the world
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:10.640]   of consumer markets. Now, Apple has a unique position in the sense that the enterprise market
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.840]   and the consumer market is practically the same thing to Apple. Human beings using the devices.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.240]   That's the way to look at it. It's a really interesting perspective and it really works for Apple.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:29.440]   But Google and soon-to-upper-child leading Google, they're losing interest in the consumer market,
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:33.440]   I'm pretty sure. Although, admittedly, Apple was a hardware company,
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:38.800]   but I want to say was because a lot of what Apple is doing now is focused on services.
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:44.000]   They've understood they've saturated probably the market for hardware.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.440]   What they're trying to grow on is average revenue per user through services.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.560]   Does that kind of software? I don't know what that counts as, but it ain't hardware.
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:57.760]   Well, the services are essentially recurring revenue points.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:02.560]   You sell the watch once every couple of years. You'll sell a phone every couple of years,
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:08.240]   but you get the monthly income every month from those owners. That's good money.
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:14.320]   Yeah. I think that if you're thinking about Apple 1 from a subscription perspective,
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.080]   it's not going to take long before in that Apple 1, you might have a hardware piece
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:25.040]   that you also, whether it's the iPhone or something else, but you're already
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:34.000]   subscribing to it. You see that with the Apple card. I bought all my hardware on Apple card,
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:41.120]   and I'm paying monthly installments. That's it. They know that they got me for
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:46.960]   the first time ever paying off. For the first time ever, I'm hearing Apple card advertisements
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:52.000]   on podcasts. I don't know if it's going to be sex buying those or Apple. It's got to be Apple.
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:59.600]   They've been slowly moving into financial services, but that's very lucrative.
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:06.160]   Yeah. I get 3% back on all my purchases because I buy on the Apple card.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:10.000]   In fact, those are-- But even though this says, "Stop it,"
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:15.120]   these are purchases we want to-- "Thug, stop buying on your personal Apple card." I said,
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:23.680]   "But Lisa, I get 3%. But I do think that Apple sees the services, especially financial
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:28.560]   services, is gravy on top of their core competency." Well, that's where the growth is going to be.
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.600]   But it's where the growth is going to be. But in order to make it really grow,
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:38.960]   they also have to grow the hardware and everything else. They're basically in the content consumption
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:45.440]   device and software and service business and the content creation device business.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:48.720]   And that's why they're two of their big things coming up in the future
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:57.600]   is augmented reality, which is a content-- the mother of all content consumption platforms,
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:00.640]   if you will, especially the ones that you're going to wear all day that look like ordinary
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:07.520]   glasses that are coming in a few years. And then the Apple car, a self-driving car is the ultimate
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:11.920]   content consumption device, essentially. And they want to--
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:18.400]   In the living room, on wheels. Yeah. In fact, they've done a lot of tests to show what the
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.560]   screens would be like in the living room that you're riding around in in your Apple car.
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:26.080]   That's-- There's nothing else to do. Forced attention, exactly.
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:29.680]   And he's quite jogging as well. And you pay for it all with your Apple card.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:37.280]   No, no, I refuse. We finally had to get a new car recently. I don't know this is a non-sequitur,
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.680]   but kind of off Mike's point. Cars have gotten so good. We went from a manual transmission
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:47.520]   2007 Volvo to a relatively recent Outback. And this thing's like a spaceship. So I'm actually
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:51.360]   bringing this all-driving car. I'll take it. The like, what we got now is pretty good.
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.280]   What kind of dog is that? Everybody wants to know.
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:18:00.560]   Oh, I'm sorry. This is Magnolia. She's our nearest rescue. The dogs have learned that they can
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.640]   push the door open in my office when I'm working in come play. And so they've been doing this
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:08.880]   throughout the show and I've been trying to-- We're recording. Sometimes, shoot them out, but Maggie
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.560]   just wanted some snuggles. So-- Hold the Magnolia up a little bit so we can-- Is she a poodle mix?
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:20.880]   Little teary there. Shih Tzu, silky terrier, some havenies. She's a rescue from Chicago.
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:28.560]   She's my light and joy in my office. My office mate. So was she there when I visited her?
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:31.920]   This is-- She was. She was. No, she-- We've had her for about a year and a half now.
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:37.520]   She's one of my French friends called Gorgie. She's a girl for Menorgy.
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.160]   I don't know how to respond to that one.
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:52.080]   I don't either. I'm not in other words. Yes. Yeah, she's-- No, I got the subtext. She is a mix of
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:57.520]   many things and she's 100% proud. Although, I do think we have a show title. I don't think--
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:02.800]   She's a Gorgie. All right, I'm going to take a break. I'm going to take a break because I'm embarrassed.
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:08.000]   And when we come back, the final few stories of actually some of the biggest stories,
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.640]   one that's just breaking right now, this week in tech is brought to you by ITProTV.
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:19.680]   I saw many of you who listen to our shows are love technology, right? I mean, why would you
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:24.160]   listen to a technology podcast unless you cared about technology? And I have spoken to so many
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.760]   people who said, you know, I listen to the shows and I thought, I don't like my job. I should get--
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:36.720]   I should be getting IT because I love this stuff. Well, let me tell you where I send them ITProTV.
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:42.160]   It's the best way to get the best possible IT training, whether it's for your first job
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:47.440]   and getting those certs you need to get that first job like the A+ cert. Or if you're in IT to
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:51.680]   accelerate your IT career, learn a new language, learn a new networking system,
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:59.440]   learn a new operating system, ITProTV makes it fun. They hire experts in the field. That's really
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.640]   important. That's job one. These people have to be working professionals in IT. But then,
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:09.440]   they also have to have a passion, a love for what they do. And that's what makes ITProTV's
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:14.080]   content so engaging, so fun. These are people who love what they do and they communicate that
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:20.080]   passion to you in just the best possible way. They've got seven studios working all day,
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:23.920]   Monday through Friday to make new content because everything's constantly changing.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:30.400]   So when I say they have a 5,800 hour library of IT training on demand, it's not always the same
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:36.560]   hours. There's new stuff all the time, new operating systems, new tests, new questions,
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:42.160]   certs change. But ITProTV is always up to date, more up to date than any other place you can go.
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:46.160]   And that's that commitment with those seven studios running Monday through Friday.
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.240]   All the training episodes are in 20 to 30 minute chunks because they've learned.
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:54.480]   That's pretty much your attention span. You could do it during lunch, during a break.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:21:00.320]   You watch an episode and you're learning, but then it doesn't stop there because they've got
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:06.800]   virtual labs. You can set up, for instance, a Windows server in your browser on a Chromebook,
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:10.880]   set up a Windows server and Windows clients. And you know, if something goes wrong, you just
[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:15.360]   close the tab and start over. They've got practice tests. So you could take the exam before you take
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:22.080]   the exam. They help you get job. They support you every step of the way. And you can watch
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:29.920]   wherever you want on your computer, tablet, Apple TV, Roku. It's easy to watch whenever you've got a
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:34.720]   moment. One reviewer said it's easy to understand what they're saying. It's well explained. The
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:39.280]   classes are very smooth along with the notes and transcriptions. I forgot to mention that. You
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:44.240]   get complete transcriptions by wrapping their own experience in with the course. It makes it
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.800]   easier to comprehend the hardest topics. They also make sure you feel confident enough to pass the
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:54.400]   exams. That's awesome. Another reviewer said, best website to study IT and cybersecurity related
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:58.400]   courses. I like the part where they make a few courses free for a weekend. In fact, they are
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:04.720]   doing that every month. Every month, IT Pro TV offers free webinars you can watch. You'll find
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:08.240]   them if you go to the website, there's a fact we're looking right through the list of them right now.
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:12.880]   You can watch all the past webinars on demand. And if you're around in the right time of the
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:19.280]   month, you can you can join them and ask questions too. IT Pro TV also has plans for teams. So if you
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:23.360]   have a business with an IT team, you know how important it is to keep them up on security and
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:29.760]   networking and all the skills, the best place for them to learn is also IT Pro TV. We've known these
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:36.160]   guys Tim and Don since they started this company almost 10 years ago now and they are so good.
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:42.160]   They're just the best in the business. You get 30% off when you sign up at itpro.tv/twit
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:51.120]   and use the code TWIT30. 30% off when you sign up at itpro.tv/twit. If you use the offer code TWIT30,
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:57.120]   IT Pro TV, build or expand your IT career and enjoy the journey. I think you're going to love
[02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:05.280]   IT Pro TV and you're going to love your new job. I hear from people all the time who say thank you
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:14.000]   for IT Pro TV. Hey, we had a fun week this week on TWIT. I think Victor has prepared a little movie
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:21.440]   for us. Watch. I got an alert yesterday. Yes, here at my desk. Was that your first quake?
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:27.520]   That was my first earthquake. Oh, it was a very mild quake, I must say. That was funny. People
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:32.320]   was like, that was nothing and I'm thinking, dang, what does a bad one feel like? Previously
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:40.480]   onto it. Mac break weekly. Nothing says we wish we had named the notch so people call it
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:46.400]   something that isn't the notch like calling us the dynamic island. Like they lost control of
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.600]   the narrative there and they're like, no, no, no, it's an island, people, a dynamic island.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:57.280]   This week in Google, Matt Mullenweg is, you all know, the founder of automatic,
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:01.600]   co-founder of WordPress. You know, one of the things we did out of Tonnev,
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:06.320]   Refriger2 in Tumler, once we bought it, was cleaning it up. You know, there was a lot of hate
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:12.400]   speech on there. There's a lot of kids, you know, talking about self-harm or drugs or other things
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:18.880]   and like, you can't, you need to garden the space. You need to curate it. All about Android.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:25.520]   After an apple event, there is usually the Android reaction, right? Brace yourselves. We're
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:30.080]   going to see a lot of dynamic islands coming to Android here in the coming months. Not jealous,
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:37.760]   just saying, I'm not jelly. Twit. I don't want that. I want that.
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:47.840]   October 6th, actually the Pixel 6 event, Jason Howell, Ron Richards and I will be getting up early
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:52.640]   to watch that Google event coming out of Brooklyn on October 6th to see what the new Pixel 7
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:59.360]   and the new Pixel Watch are like. Yeah, I keep rooting for Google. I really like their hardware.
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:13.680]   So maybe they'll pull out something. Wow, this story just breaking. A PC gamer is reporting
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:21.040]   that a user on the Grand Theft Auto forums has posted a 3 GB file full of 90 videos of Grand Theft
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:31.280]   Auto 6 footage. The user is named Teapot Uber hacker, claims to be behind the Uber hack last week,
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:37.200]   which was a complete social engineering hack and just shows how vulnerable every company is.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:43.840]   They tricked an Uber employee into giving them access. It just keeps happening, right? It's almost
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.960]   impossible to stop. They had two factors. It didn't matter. They just, I probably said,
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:53.040]   hey, we're from the IT department. We're just checking this login. Can you login for us?
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:57.200]   Okay, good. That looks good. What's the code that they just sent you? Okay. All right,
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:02.240]   that looks all right. We're good. And now they've got full access, right? I don't know if that's
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:08.400]   the same technique they use to hack Grand Theft Auto 6, but this has been a long-awaited game.
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:18.400]   And apparently, according to Bloomberg reporter, the leak is real. Jason Schreier confirmed it
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:25.360]   through sources at Rockstar. They're being posted to YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, online gaming forums.
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:31.760]   I don't know. You look like you might be a GTA player, Alex. I don't know.
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:37.120]   No, I mean, I have historically played GTA games going back to the era, which they were actually
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:42.880]   top-down 2D, but not in a very long time. What's interesting is how this sort of leak you might
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:49.520]   think would be always well received amongst gamers, but it's actually not. So there's a game coming
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:55.840]   out called Victoria 3, which is a grand strategy, political sim, essentially. And it comes out in
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:59.280]   a couple of weeks, and I've been looking forward to it. So I've been tracking the news and a build
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:05.040]   of it leaked a couple months back. And the community behind the gaming company and also the game
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.040]   itself were a little peevish about it because the developers were kind of banged because it was an
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:12.640]   older build and it didn't show off what they built. And they didn't want people to get the wrong
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:16.880]   impression of what the game's going to be. And so you would think these leaks are slam dunks for
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.760]   the communities, but they're a little bit more complex than that. But in the case of GTA 6,
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:26.640]   a game that has been in underproduction for apparently 700 years, there's a lot of pent up
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:31.680]   demand. So I'm not entirely shocked that something finally broke. If it is the same hacker from the
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:39.040]   Uber hack, that's embarrassing for tax. It's embarrassing. It's actually Rockstar gets hacked
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.120]   pretty routinely. GTA 6 has reportedly at least two years away, according to the Verge.
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:51.280]   I'm sure Rockstar is bum because it's early unfinished development builds, testing.
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:59.120]   Yeah, this is never good for a game company. And I have to say, embarrassing. Yes. But also,
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:04.960]   you guys, we got to get this social engineering under control. You got to train your employees
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.960]   to be more skeptical. I wonder if it's possible. And I'm curious what Mike and
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:13.440]   Caroline to think about this, because it seems to me not an issue that we've solved,
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:19.440]   as long as we're using to find your... There's no solving human nature. It's human nature. Yeah.
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:24.160]   It's human nature. What you need is what you need is a wholesale embrace of zero trust
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:32.800]   architecture everywhere. And this will get us in the ballpark of not having
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:39.200]   Chinese spies working at Twitter, not having everything being leaked, not having everything
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.560]   being compromised all the time through social engineering, because people will always be people.
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:54.800]   We're on the brink of totally believable deep fake video that is affected in real time. There
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:00.240]   are people who are applying for jobs and doing interviews, and they're using somebody else's face
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:07.440]   to do the video interview. Deep fake audio is a big deal. So we really have to... We can't rely on
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:13.040]   training, as you said. I mean, we need a lot more training, for sure, around cybersecurity. But we
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:20.720]   have to embrace zero trust as just a baseline. And even the federal government is finally
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:27.280]   being forced through a Biden executive order to embrace zero trust. So zero trust is got to be
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:31.440]   the new baseline at all these companies. Or this kind of stuff is just going to be routine.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:37.120]   I would also say physical keys as opposed to phone or authenticator based,
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:43.440]   because two factor, because even if somebody convinced me they were from the security division,
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:47.840]   they wouldn't have this. And there's no way I can give them this Yuba key.
[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:52.560]   And so that would have stopped this cold. That's one way to do this.
[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:58.480]   And it's a very... I mean, that's a form of authentication that is very powerful.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:03.200]   But we need all kinds of different... We need to authenticate the users every time they access a
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.200]   resource or something. And force that authentication. Yes, absolutely. And strong.
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:12.080]   So we didn't really have time to talk about it, but the whole... All the congressional
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:19.760]   gnashing of teeth and ripping of hair over TikTok is a bit of a red herring, because basically,
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:27.920]   this idea that because TikTok is a Chinese company, that the Chinese Communist Party or whatever
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:34.400]   will have access to it, that mindset is a perimeter security mindset. They think, "Well,
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:40.560]   because they're over there and the Communist Party is over there, they'll have access." Well,
[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:46.800]   that's not how any of this stuff works anymore. There is no perimeter for any company anywhere,
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:52.720]   which is why you need zero trust. And so this grandstanding members of Congress drives me nuts.
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:58.800]   That's pure xenophobia when Josh Hawley says, "Your company has a lot to hide. You're a
[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:05.440]   walking security nightmare." And completely ignores the fact that Facebook is licking information like
[02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:12.880]   a sieve. I mean, just because it's a Chinese-owned company, that's not the problem.
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:22.240]   Chinese spies will get access to every social network as they can, and in other words, all of them.
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:28.880]   They are already compromising those companies. And the other worst bit of grandstanding is when
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:33.680]   they say, "Oh, how many Communist Party members do you have at your company?" Well, there's like,
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:37.680]   I don't know, there's like 100 million Chinese Communist Party members in China. That's what you
[02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:42.160]   do if you want your kids to go to a good school and all that kind of stuff. So they know they're
[02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:48.720]   Chinese Communist Party members working at TikTok. It's just a handring to the ignorant.
[02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:54.480]   By dancing, owning ownership. Yeah. So that's the distinction that doesn't quite work for
[02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:57.680]   American legislators. And to be clear, I'm not going to sit here and defend Josh Hawley in any
[02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:04.000]   capacity ever. But I will say that I don't think it's xenophobic to say that the government and
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:10.080]   economic rules that are set up in China are antithetical to the sort of transparency that we might want
[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:13.920]   in terms of everything from auditing corporate financials, which has been a big stick in point
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:19.680]   between the US and China for a long time, to data privacy and security. And given the sheer quantity
[02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:24.640]   of state-sponsored hacking and so forth, he's seen from the Chinese government, to me being
[02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:30.080]   skeptical at a very minimum of claims regarding data privacy matters. And given the amount of US
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:37.200]   data in play, yeah, go for it, Mike. There are three issues. One of them is gathering data,
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:42.000]   which is what they're obsessing about. Okay, they can gather data from any of the social
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.400]   networks. I don't think it's necessarily easier to do it from ByteDance than it is from Twitter.
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:50.800]   It's probably easier to harvest that data from Twitter. And what kind of data do you get from
[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:56.560]   somebody who's posting videos and what? Movement of troops, maybe something like that. The other
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:33:03.840]   thing is the oppression of pro-democracy people around the world, which the Chinese government
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:09.520]   is definitely interested in suppressing those people. And the third thing is propaganda.
[02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:14.800]   That's the real risk with TikTok. That's the main risk with TikTok, if there was a conflict. So,
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:23.520]   for example, if a China invades Taiwan or when they invade Taiwan, it seems like they really
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:29.040]   intend to do that at some point. And if the West gets into a conflict over that issue,
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:37.520]   it seems to me a no-brainer that the Chinese government would reach their hands into ByteDance
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:41.680]   and say, "You know what? We don't want any of this kind of stuff and we want lots more of that kind
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:51.120]   of stuff." And that is a real reason to be concerned about that. You can imagine if ByteDance is a
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:59.440]   Russian company, what Vladimir Putin would be making them do around propaganda. But all this
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:05.440]   stuff about data, the thing they're focusing on most is the data privacy. And that's the least
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:08.560]   of any, that should be the least of their concern.
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:10.720]   Terri-
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:16.720]   But the point that I don't understand and maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way is
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:24.480]   you're, I agree what you said, Mike. And in that case, you have a government that is asking
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:33.440]   you to do things. But when you're looking at Facebook and Twitter and Western social platforms,
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:39.680]   they might not have a government, but they have play years that pay them to put more of
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:47.040]   this and less of that on their networks. So it seems like the government is using two different
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:59.840]   weights to assess and then punish or discipline or, I guess, constrain this social media platforms.
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:05.360]   And for TikTok is because they're owned by a Chinese company.
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:11.040]   Well, it doesn't help to be an American company and the EU Google has lost an appeal
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:21.360]   over illegal Android app bundling. 4.1 billion euro fine was reduced from 4.3 billion
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:30.640]   because this goes back to 2018. The company imposed unlawful restrictions on Android phone
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.040]   manufacturers in order to promote its search engine on mobile devices, things like saying if
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:43.680]   you are selling a Google-ized version of Android, you can't sell the AOSP on Google version on
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:50.080]   others of your phones. You must pre-install Google search and Chrome apps and the play store,
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:55.120]   things like that. That is enough to sting 4.1 billion euros, right?
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:36:00.480]   Yeah, even for Google, I think, currently, that's enough money that they're going to sit up and go
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:07.200]   dang. Dang. Ouch. Well, again, we can't swear on Twitch. So I'm trying to make this a little
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:12.640]   more family friendly. They have tons of cash, but they use it for things like shareholder return.
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:19.680]   So to me, a 4.1 billion euro fine. Now, roughly $4.1 billion is material even for a company about
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:25.920]   scale. Yeah. Google has to wait two months and 10 days before it can appeal because this is
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:31.600]   on appeal. But there is one last appeal available in a couple of months, and that's to the highest
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:36.400]   court in the EU, the Court of Justice. I see no reason to think that Court of Justice will overturn
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:43.200]   this. I'm not sure I agree with it. Google says we're disappointed the court did not
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:47.840]   annul the decision in full and I do agree with this next sentence. Android has created more
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.120]   choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:37:00.560]   around the world. I can't disagree with that. Isn't Google kind of being punished because they have
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:06.640]   an open source version of Android? I mean, they'd avoid this if they didn't have AOSP if they just
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:10.640]   said, well, no, it's I mean, Apple doesn't get Apple requires all sorts of stuff for people
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.960]   to carriers to have an iPhone in their lineup. That's not illegal. I think it's because
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.080]   their justification, right? They're just apples justification is because we want to make sure
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:28.320]   that there's a good experience, that it's secure, all that kind of stuff. The thing that
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:33.680]   there are parts of this that make more sense than other parts, the part that makes the least
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:40.320]   sense to me is that I do think it should be fine for Google to say, okay, if you're going to use,
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:47.440]   if you're going to sell devices with our free open source version, then we're not going to license
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:53.680]   to you the Google version, right? And this is a point of contention. I think that's a reasonable
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:57.600]   thing for them to do for the same as you went out. Yes, for your experience. Yes.
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:02.880]   They're offering this free version. They're enriching all these companies and getting nothing in return.
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:08.240]   And so I think that's fairly reasonable. But they're also saying, okay, if you do use the Google
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:11.920]   version, you have to have our search engine, you have to have all these things installed,
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:15.280]   and this gets back to Microsoft and Internet Explorer and all that kind of stuff. There we go.
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:21.760]   If they're going to punish Microsoft for bundling Internet Explorer, maybe it's consistent to
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:26.720]   punish Google for bundling or forcing other companies to bundle their browser.
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.640]   So isn't Google offering more opportunity and more choice than Apple is?
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:36.880]   Well, but Apple is now open source saying that's not.
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:42.160]   So Google's mistake was being good and open source. No, no, no, no, no, I think you're doing
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:45.200]   this back. You're saying Apple's not in trouble. Therefore, Google shouldn't be.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.680]   I'm saying Google isn't trouble. Therefore, Apple should be.
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:53.280]   Well, maybe. But Google's big mistake here, it seems to be, is allowing Android open source.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:56.800]   And the EU is saying, oh, you're requiring Android open source.
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:04.320]   You're keeping people from using the effect that it even exists is a good thing, isn't it?
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:08.880]   There's no open source iOS. And as a result, Apple's not in trouble.
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:18.240]   So the way. So we Americans tend to think of how American law deals with antitrust.
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:23.520]   We see it as a competitive issue that harms consumers. Whereas in Europe, they see antitrust
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:27.040]   is an anti-competitive thing that harms other companies, competitors.
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:35.680]   And so the existence of open source and the subsidy of that product, if you will,
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:45.440]   by their non-open source version of Android is a bit anti-competitive from the European mindset,
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:48.960]   just the existence of open source. Because basically what they're doing is they're blocking other
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:53.840]   innovators from entering the market and having an inexpensive or free operating system.
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:59.520]   Most of the cheapest phones in the world use the open source version of Android.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:06.000]   And Google is kind of, it's a kind of a holding mechanism where Google has this brand name,
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:12.240]   it has this, Android has this brand awareness in the global market. And then they have this free
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:16.720]   version out there preventing new entrants in the market. So I can see that. But that's not
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:22.320]   even what they're doing here. They basically just don't like the whole scenario apparently.
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:26.400]   And they think that Google, if Google's going to have an open source thing, it should be available
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.720]   to all companies, including those that choose to use the non-open source version of Android.
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:37.520]   So I don't know, it's an ugly ruling and it's not really about Europe
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:45.280]   coming up with these ideas and then finding Google. Europe is like the US in that sense,
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:51.040]   it's other American companies are complaining to Europe and Europe's going, "Okay, all right,
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:55.120]   we'll go with the Microsoft point of view," whatever it is, or Apple's point of view, whoever's lobbying
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:41:02.560]   them. And so I don't like this ruling, I don't like this fine. I think there are other areas of
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:08.240]   like search advertising and stuff where they have a stronger case. This just seems fairly arbitrary to
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:17.040]   me. So the state of Texas has a law
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:25.680]   that declared social media platforms with more than 50 million monthly average users, in other
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:37.200]   words, Twitter and Facebook, are common carriers. And as a result, they should not be allowed to
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:40.560]   decide who can post and who can't post. They shouldn't be allowed to
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:51.600]   deplatform conservative voices. That law, of course, violates the First Amendment because government
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:57.040]   is supposedly not supposed to make any laws that abridge the freedom of speech, even of
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:05.440]   companies like Twitter. Nevertheless, so a number of companies sued in court. The Fifth Circuit
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:19.120]   Court, by the way, they in their in the initial court ruling, the law was temporarily put on hold,
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:25.120]   right? Supreme Court said, "Well, let this, you guys work this out." They said, "Okay, the law is
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:31.680]   blocked for now, but the lawsuit has to play out." Now, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:37.280]   Orleans has ruled in favor of the Texas law saying, "No, no, that's fine. What First Amendment,
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.840]   Schmerst Amendment. Now, of course, it's going to have to go to the Supreme Court.
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:46.480]   No idea what the Supreme Court is going to do with this. This is very similar to the Florida law,
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:53.120]   which allows which was ruled unconstitutional by an appeals court.
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:59.120]   So now you have two decisions by equal courts that are both going to go, I'm sure go to the
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:04.960]   Supreme Court, one for one again." There's an inversion here that I find interesting.
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:08.480]   During the net neutrality debate, conservatives were trying to argue that these
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:13.600]   Internet providers were not common carriers. And now social media companies, which have much
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:18.320]   stronger protections written in the Constitution, are now being forced to platform speech they
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:23.760]   don't want to. I like to view it that way versus their deep platform has to choose to not amplify.
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:27.200]   You have to publish this content. Yeah.
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:31.200]   This is also not about the censoring of conservatives. It's about the right of platforms to be able
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.440]   to police their own networks and what content is uploaded to it, which is a very important thing.
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:37.680]   Yeah. Otherwise they can't moderate, right?
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:42.320]   Right. Let's not fall prey to the Fox News framing of this and talk about how we're trying to save
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:46.400]   conservative speech. Conservatives are doing fine on Twitter. I follow a bunch of them because
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:55.120]   I keep my eyes open. But I'm in awe of the gumption of Texas and the sheer insanity of
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:59.600]   quote small government conservatives trying to use the government to force private corporations
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.920]   that they fought to and try as individuals and others to print court rulings as being
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:10.960]   forced to platform speech they don't want to. It's a bizarre world of right wing bull. Oh, sorry.
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:16.560]   The law, it's like Humpty Dumpty. The law means what I wanted to mean at any particular time.
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:21.280]   Right. These are just neo-fascist. These are not people that care about anything other than power.
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:26.480]   It's not internally consistent. It's not philosophically consistent. It's just, well, this is what I want.
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:31.520]   Make it so. It's the wrong to stand to approach the governance, which is terrifying.
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:35.440]   Unfortunately, we have a Supreme Court that is dominated by conservatives. So I'm not sure
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:40.240]   what's going to happen when this goes to the Supreme Court. Yeah. You know, we have never
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.400]   had in the Supreme Court an atheist. You know, that would be nice. First, it was having to be two
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:50.160]   thirds Catholic. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Yeah. Finally. All right. Show of hands. How
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:57.600]   many of you turn on closed captioning when you're watching TV? The young guy, the old guy,
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:04.000]   and the two middle guys. Everybody does very interesting article in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:10.640]   It turns out 20 somethings are turning on closed caption. I thought I turned it on because I
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:16.640]   couldn't hear. What did you say? What are they talking about? But in fact, at this point, recent
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:22.640]   surveys suggest younger generations are using closed captioning more than the old folks,
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:28.560]   not because of hearing problems, but they just, they can't otherwise, they can't pay attention or
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:34.720]   something. They talked to a 23 year old who said, "I can't think of a time in the past couple of
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:38.320]   months or years that I haven't had subtitles or captions on." He doesn't have any hearing
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:43.760]   problems, but he says, "It helps him focus on what's happening on screen even when I have the sound on."
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:50.080]   Yep. This is easy. Guys, we all have phones. We're on Twitter. We're watching
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.800]   Rings of Power or The Dragon show, and I get distracted so I look up. I can read much faster
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:01.040]   than people can talk. So I can just grab a block of text, send a tweet. It's so you can multitask.
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:02.720]   It is. Yeah.
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:11.040]   And it also comes from... I think it's part of it. Yeah, I was going to say that for Gen Ziers is
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:17.200]   also about the fact that because they do so much on phones and a lot of times in places where they
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:24.640]   shouldn't be doing anything on a phone, so the sound is off. So it's interesting that the 20 year
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:32.400]   old says even when the sound is on, because in most cases it isn't. I do it for every content I
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:39.600]   produce for accessibility reasons. It started, I think, I'm going to guess with Facebook in the
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:45.360]   newsfeed because companies like Taste Made and all the companies that we're doing, you know,
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:50.000]   these trying to make viral posts realize that people don't have their sound on by default
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.600]   when they're going through the newsfeed. So in order to capture their attention, they would put
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:57.280]   captions on there. So you can see the video and you can see the caption. Maybe you'll turn the
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:02.640]   sound on, but it doesn't matter if you do. And then TikTok followed suit. Instagram automatically
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:10.160]   generates captions on uploaded videos unless you turn them off. Snapchat users can turn on auto
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:17.040]   generated subtitles. And of course on their own, snaps have auto generated titles. And now both the
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:22.720]   Pixel phone, which was the first to do it a couple of years ago, and now thanks to iOS 16,
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:30.240]   in fact, I just turned it on on my iOS 16, have automatic captioning on all videos. I have to say
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:36.800]   Google does a lot better job on the auto captioning than I from six times. Yeah. Nevertheless,
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:42.640]   I guess we're going to have it put captions on all our podcasts too, people.
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:49.680]   There's another reason for this in addition to all the reasons stated already, which is that
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:57.040]   in recent years, sound design has gotten way more aggressive. And this has been pushed by Christopher
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:04.000]   Nolan primarily and then others following suit, where it's actually objectively dialogue is
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:11.120]   objectively less intelligible than it used to be. And there's a lot more content that we watch,
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:18.800]   where people have strong accents. So the combination of lots of other noise going on in the content,
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:25.280]   and people speaking in a way that's a much broader range of accents means that
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:32.960]   there's kind of like a sort of utilitarian reason to put on captioning. We just can't understand.
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:36.400]   I can't. It's not just all folks. Nobody can understand what's going on.
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:42.800]   Right. And also, actually. It's interesting though, that it doesn't seem that although
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:49.280]   this is becoming more prevalent, that people are not actually investing, I was complaining about
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:57.200]   this on Twitter just a few weeks ago, because my mom is visiting and she's watching Netflix,
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:05.680]   in Italian with subtitles in Italian. And although Italian is good, there's no correlation between
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:11.520]   what they say and what I can read. And it's not because it's wrong. It's just a totally different
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:20.560]   sentence. Because I don't think that content creators are investing enough to actually have
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:28.960]   good subtitles and things done properly, especially for those markets like Italy,
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:33.760]   where everything is dubbed. There was a great piece on the slash film
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:40.480]   came out last year, I think they've just updated it. Here's why movie dialogue has gotten more
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:46.640]   difficult to understand. And they blame a bunch of things. Some of it's because of people like Chris
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:53.040]   Nolan, director of Tenet, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight Rises, who wants to sound more natural.
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:56.960]   Robert Altman started this, wants to have, hey, that's the way life is. Everybody's talking at
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:04.800]   the same time. It's also actors who, you know, I think Marlon Brando started it, who mumbled a
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:10.880]   little bit because they want it to be more realistic. And then really, this is the third one, which is
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.240]   that the sound record is the person who's on the set often isn't respected enough. The sound
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:20.560]   record is should be able to say, hey, no one's going to be able to understand that dialogue.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:27.120]   Very often, the sound guy doesn't say that, or if he does, they say, no, we're moving on.
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:36.640]   So it is a big problem. And I think it is another reason why people are, this is an interesting one.
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:41.600]   I asked a sound recordist who called the radio show, and he talked about familiarity. He said,
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:46.160]   everybody kind of has heard this dialogue so many times. We all know what the person's saying. So we
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:50.800]   director and sound guy may not even notice that you can't understand it because we've heard it
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:58.320]   so many times. We know what he's saying. And then of course, there's the problem of 5.17.1, 1,000.1
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:02.560]   mixing, which means you have to have a center channel to hear anything. I think it's just very
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:06.560]   interesting. I think it's going to be in years to come. Everything will have a caption on it
[02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:14.160]   all the time. And it's not because of us old folks. Although I have to say, I leave the captions
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:21.280]   there are some shows like Succession where there's Soto Voche dialogue. There's the main dialogue,
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.600]   and then people are saying something in the background. And if you leave the captions on,
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:28.720]   they often transcribe the Soto Voche dialogue. So if there's something subtle behind the scenes,
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:32.720]   you can kind of catch it because you're reading it instead of listening to it.
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:38.320]   Well, the struggle here is that if you have a partner who disagrees with you on the use of
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:45.360]   captions, it engenders a regular conversation about if they should be on or not. And I happen
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:50.640]   to have one of these spouses who does not appreciate them. And she says that if you want to understand
[02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:54.960]   what they're saying, stop looking at Twitter on your phone and watch. And I'm like, oh, she's
[02:51:54.960 --> 02:52:01.680]   bold. She's bold. I would not dare say that out loud. I have a spouse that is a brilliant
[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:07.280]   and non-techy person, if that makes sense. She's not as digital. She actually watches movies when
[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:13.600]   they're on like, people sit down and watch a movie crazy. That's it. How does somebody do that?
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:17.680]   How does somebody pay attention span is shot? I have no idea. No, I know. We're ruined.
[02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:23.120]   We're ruined. This is yet another interesting development in the world of augmented reality
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:29.440]   glasses. So Google has translation glasses, but basically those are going to be capable of providing
[02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:35.600]   closed captions for everything you can. The caption be in the glasses. Yes. That's in Alex's
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:39.840]   case. He'll be able to have closed captioning and his wife won't have to see it because they'll
[02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:43.760]   be in his glasses. But I think a lot of people are going to do this in real life. They're going to
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:48.320]   have their closed captioning on everything all the time. Who would have thought that? But you're
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:55.360]   absolutely right. That's going to drive more than anything AR. So Google Glass, which we all
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:53:00.880]   had a brief moment in the product world, I got to wear it once. And I did get to use the software
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:06.080]   that would look at a sign in a different language and it would change it to your language.
[02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:10.000]   And that is still one of the very few magical moments for me in tech. And one of the other ones
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.440]   was actually HoloLens, the first time I used a Microsoft's campus. And so Mike, I hope you're
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:19.920]   right because AR has blown my socks off several times and few techs have managed to do that more
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:25.360]   than once. So I'm here for it. I wore Google Glass when we were living in Florence back when
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:31.920]   Google Glass was happening. I wore it all over the place. The Italians mostly had never heard of it,
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:35.120]   didn't know what it was, thought it had some sort of medical problem and they just would look
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:41.360]   away politely. But I got a lot of photos and videos that I wouldn't have otherwise gotten. And I
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:46.080]   use that very same service called Magic Lens or something like that. I don't remember exactly what
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:52.960]   it's called. But yeah, you look at a sign and it would give you the sign in English in the same
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:58.800]   typeface. Yeah, it was incredible. You could do that with a phone now, of course.
[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:02.560]   With a phone. Yeah, it's obvious you're doing that with menus or with signs. Yeah.
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:07.040]   Yeah. Yeah, I look forward to that. That'll be nice in the glasses. Yeah.
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:11.360]   The Italians were right though because he was suffering from the same disease that we also
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:16.960]   from here on the show, which is acute nerdiness. And there's no cure. There's no case of glass
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:22.000]   wholeness. There's no cure. Well, no, the cure, Leo, or the way to diminish the symptoms is to
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.400]   get 3% back on your apple card, apparently. There. Yes. That's solved it for me.
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:35.680]   Alex Wilhelm, great to see you. Good luck. We may not talk to you before you are a father,
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:42.480]   but I'm so happy for you too. And if we don't talk to you before then, congratulations,
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:46.480]   and we'll talk to you in six months. Thank you. I just want to throw in one little thing about my
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:50.240]   comment earlier. Nothing against Catholics. Just think representation matters on the Supreme Court.
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:53.200]   It's all a turn set. Well, you know, it's really interesting, America.
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:58.400]   You go into hell out. I don't know. Other countries, but if a candidate for office
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.800]   said, "Oh, I'm an atheist," they probably wouldn't get elected, would they? I mean,
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:06.640]   no president's ever dared to say that. They all at least pretend to be religious.
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:10.480]   Right. Yes. We know Donald Trump is not religious. I don't think he said
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:16.480]   for the church in his life, but he sure pretended to be. Effectively, too.
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:22.000]   Yeah. So I don't think you can get away with it yet in this country, even though,
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:28.480]   in theory, we're a secular nation. What's it like in Italy, Carolina? Could you get elected the mayor
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:35.600]   of Milan if you said that? I don't believe that stuff. No, I think everybody assumes that.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:41.600]   And I understood Alex's comment as a Catholic. I understood what you meant.
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:46.160]   What representation? I agree. No, I really don't think that that even is
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:53.440]   thought about in Italy. It's just such a, you know, the very reasons why I still think that
[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:58.800]   there's a crucifix in every classroom of every school. Oh, yes. See, we can't do that. We don't do
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:06.560]   that. Yeah. Interesting. So we have a lot in common with Italy. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex,
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:11.920]   great to have you. Carolina Milanese is so wonderful to have you. I'm sorry for miss
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:15.920]   pronouncing your name the entire time, but at least I said sort of voce correctly, right?
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:22.000]   She's a founder of the heart of tech. What is the heart of tech?
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:29.200]   As a consultant, the company that helps tech company in particular in their ESG strategy.
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:38.000]   ESG is environment, social social and governance governance.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:44.880]   I believe in ESG. So I believe in the heart of tech. I think that's great. And of course,
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:53.280]   you're also an analyst. And your writings can be seen at creative strategies. And on Twitter,
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:57:00.720]   Caro underscore Milan Milanese. Thank you, Carolina. So good to see you.
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:04.640]   That's it. Oh, yes. That's your meal. Mike Elgin.
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:16.400]   Ciao, baby. He is Mike's, Mike's list at substack.com. He is a gastro nomad at gastronomad.net.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:23.680]   He is about to embark on the Barcelona adventure and then on to Morocco. Wow.
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:31.040]   Let me just look and see. Are there any openings in the experiences coming up that we can get
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:38.640]   part become part of? I don't know. We haven't done Mexico City in a few years where our next one
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:43.120]   is in May. So if you really want to see Mexico City, that's a great one, May 1st.
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:51.840]   And then we do the Proseco Hills in Italy in late May, Provence in June, and then so and so on.
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:58.720]   So I recommend everybody join us. Check it out. Do you have any questions? Yeah. So awesome. Thank you,
[02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:03.920]   Leo. Can I get a quick shout out? Love plug Kevin.
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:13.360]   Chatterbox is a education revolution. Go to hello, Chatterbox.com. And it's a smart speaker
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:18.240]   that kids build and teach and it teaches them about AI and all kinds of great
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:24.400]   STEM skills, great for schools, great for individuals. And I recommend this very, very highly
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:28.880]   to everyone who whether you're a child or not, even if you're an adult, you want to build your own
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:34.800]   smart speaker that's 100% private. Chatterbox is the way to go. And thank you for letting me
[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:40.560]   pitch that. Leo, I also want to shout out to my Alex, my granddaughter, Princess Quiskey face,
[02:58:40.560 --> 02:58:45.920]   who watches the show. Did you know if you know that? No. She she knows it as Uncle Leo's TV show.
[02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:56.640]   And she gets to watch it when I'm on. So. Hi, Princess Quiskey face. Hi, Alex. Hi. Kevin's
[02:58:56.640 --> 02:59:01.680]   I did a swear. Yeah. No, that's okay. That's all right. She's a little old.
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:07.280]   The show. That's a good name for this. I call Leo's TV show. Anyway, thank you for that, Leo.
[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:12.480]   And they have Raspberry Pies, which is good. So you can get your chat. Yeah. Yeah. He's
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:19.200]   selling to a lot of schools now. And it's just that's a revolution. That's fantastic.
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:24.880]   Great to see all three of you. Thank you for being here. We really appreciate it. We do
[02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:34.560]   Twitter Sunday afternoons. 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern. That's 2100 UTC. If you want to watch us do it live live.
[02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:40.080]   Twit.tv. That's kind of the pre show. We really get started more about 2.30 in the afternoon,
[02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:46.160]   about half an hour later. If you're watching live, why don't you chat with us at our IRC channel.
[02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:54.400]   Let's open to all IRC.twit.tv. There is a very exclusive channel you could also join. It's our
[02:59:54.400 --> 03:00:04.160]   Discord channel. And it's a lot of fun. It's part of our club twit. Club twit is a way to get
[03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:11.040]   ad free versions of all the shows. $7 a month is all it costs. You also get access to the Discord,
[03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:15.920]   which is full of great conversations about all sorts of things. Plus shows we don't actually put
[03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:24.000]   out on the public feeds. So Stacey's book club, which is coming up in a month. So the Untitled
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:29.440]   Linux show, which we do every Saturday afternoon, right after the Giz Fizz, which with the DeBartolo,
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:34.160]   which you do every Saturday afternoon. We also do the Hands on Mac show with Micah Sargent,
[03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:39.680]   Hands on Windows with Paul Thorett. These are all shows subsidized by the club available to club
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:45.360]   members, either live or on the Twit Plus feed. If you're interested to know more, it is a big help
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:52.560]   for us. We are coming into what I think might be a very difficult few months as recession and
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:01:03.040]   inflation combined to hit our advertisers. So help us out. Twit.tv/clubtwit. I think $7 is
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:08.640]   pretty affordable. We do make it possible to get any individual show for just $2.99 a month.
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:13.280]   And of course, we'll always do the free shows because that's how we started and we want everybody
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:19.040]   to listen. We don't want it to be a barrier to participation. But again, it helps us out a lot.
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:25.520]   And I think it will be very important in the next few months if you know what I mean.
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:35.360]   Twit.tv/clubtwit. Thanks for joining us everybody. Here we are episode 893 in an 18-year-long
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:40.400]   quest to understand what the hell is going on. Another Twit is in the game.
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:51.520]   Love y'all.
