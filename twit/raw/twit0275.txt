[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.640]   of the original Twitters here.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.960]   Mr. Kevin Rose, a dig nation.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   That's your camera right there.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.040]   Straight ahead of you.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.240]   Say hi to the people.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.760]   Hello, people.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.640]   Hello, people.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.880]   Also with us, David Prager was--
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.240]   the first Twit was recorded in April 2005 at the 21st Amendment
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.760]   Group Pub.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.520]   And you were there, right?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.920]   Yeah, right after Macworld.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   But you know who's never been on Twit before.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.680]   And I'm really thrilled to have her right now.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.600]   Zadi Diaz.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.560]   Let's go right here.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.240]   Yeah, this girl.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.880]   Which two thumbs-- what is that?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.400]   The two thumbs who've never been on Twit.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.960]   Right here.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.760]   Yeah, right here.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.240]   So good to meet you, Zadi.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.680]   I feel like I know you so well.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.080]   I know all of you guys through many--
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.440]   to many various kind of places.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280]   So it's really, really awesome to be here finally.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.520]   When did you start doing videos on the internet?
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.320]   2004, I started as a video blogger.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.160]   And so kind of, through that, got hooked up with Rocket Boom
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.560]   as a correspondent and then started doing our own show,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.400]   which at that time was called Jetset
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   and then it turned into Epic Foo.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.040]   Love Epic Foo.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.080]   And you're no longer Brooklyn girl.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.360]   You're now in the LA.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.680]   Yeah, I'm in LA five years now.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.240]   It was the Jetset show, right?
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.360]   The Jetset show.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.160]   What a great show that was.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.640]   It was fun.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.760]   You're really a pioneer in this business.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.440]   Yeah, I remember actually when we first moved to LA,
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   we were teaching people how to video blog in the Apple stores.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.720]   That's how far back I go.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.120]   It's-- hey, there's--
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.840]   For Ignatian?
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.440]   That was a long time ago.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.200]   There's a long time ago.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.240]   It was a small-- still a small world now, but back then,
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.840]   I mean, there was only-- there was Jetset show
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.600]   and there was like Ask a Ninja and Tiki Bar folks
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.040]   and maybe a handful of others, but it seemed like that was
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.160]   almost kind of--
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.520]   Yeah, and Tiki Bar's gone.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.920]   Ask a Ninja kind of came back.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.120]   He did a few shows.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.880]   Ken's been doing some shows.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.800]   Yeah, we've all been kind of coming back and forth.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.680]   I think a lot of the first people kind of got burnt out
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   a little bit.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.960]   There's that burnout rate that you go through,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.280]   where you're just always online.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.400]   And I'm sure you guys know it's kind of--
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.320]   you have to take a breather, be evaluated,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.560]   and kind of come back.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.240]   Well, I think part of the burnout is if you're doing this
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.800]   and you've been doing it for a long time
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.280]   and you're not making any money at it,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.720]   and it's like, I give up.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.920]   I give up.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.040]   But you got to hang in there.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.760]   Yeah, if you love it, you hang in there.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.920]   You do it because you love it.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.040]   That's always what I told people.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440]   They said, well, how do I make money at this?
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.400]   I said, if you're asking that question,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.120]   you're in the wrong business, because it's not--
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.200]   you don't do this for the money.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.520]   You do it because you love doing it.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.440]   Yeah, that's so true.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.960]   That applies to so many different things.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.160]   Trust me, everything really--
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.880]   You're doing this for entrepreneurs, ask me the same question.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.640]   They're like, I think I'm going to make millions of dollars
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.080]   doing this, and it's like, you're probably not.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.480]   So you make sure that you really love what you're doing.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   You got to be happy making 50 grand a year doing this.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   That's good.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   So even for entrepreneurs who are looking for a big exit,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.600]   that's still the thing to keep in mind.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.760]   Absolutely.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.720]   I remember when Dig was starting out,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.200]   I was just thinking as long as I can pay my rent,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.480]   if I could do this at home, that would be so much fun
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.760]   to be able to work on that side at home.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.000]   Then you know you're in the right business.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   There's a really good--
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.280]   What is that website where you do the funny videos?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.040]   They did the Apple iPhone versus Android.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   The woman comes in there.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.200]   They look like little Japanese cartoons.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   They did one on entrepreneurs.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.120]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.440]   I am going to make a million dollars.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.560]   You've got to play that.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   I'm going to try to find it.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.000]   If I could find it, I don't know how to--
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.560]   What was the-- it was on TechCrunch.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.440]   Maybe it was on Tech-- but yeah, good luck finding something
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.920]   on TechCrunch.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240]   They do 40 stories a minute.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.800]   I know.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.300]   I know.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.360]   It scrolls off so fast.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.560]   All right, we're going to put Kevin to work.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.320]   Here's his chance.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.000]   I could just kind of stop.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.800]   Wait, is something--
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.640]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.480]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.320]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.160]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.000]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.840]   Is it what these are?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   Are they the animations we make the little characters talk?
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   Yeah, you make the characters talk.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   Chatroom, you remember that one?
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   And it's the one on Extra Normal.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   Thank you, Gunnar.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   Extra Normal.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   Extra Normal.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   But there's a lot on Extra Normal 2.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   I don't know if I'll be able to find it, but just go in there.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   The chatroom will find that.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840]   They're good.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.560]   So I think that was one of the assignments, is take some text from one of the books they
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.960]   were reading and put it to make a movie out of it with Extra Normal.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.680]   I thought, that's pretty impressive.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   That's pretty cool.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   There we go.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   We've got a link.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   Leo, Bam, YouTube.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   Bam.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   We have a link-- Bam.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   --with Extra Normal.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   All right, we're going to play--
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   No, this is the iPhone 4 versus HTC.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   Yeah, we've seen that one.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.680]   This is a new one.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.640]   This is a one that's the same idea, but it's-- I am going to be an entrepreneur.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   It's pretty profane.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   I probably can't play it.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   You know what happened to me?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   Now, you explain this.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   I don't understand.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.840]   You would understand this.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   We use YouTube.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.040]   We put our videos up on YouTube.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   Why not?
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   I mean, that's where the audience is.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.480]   It's probably not a huge revenue for us, but it's something.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   It's video.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.240]   Well, we just-- Sarah and I do a show called iPad Today.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   We just put it up.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.880]   YouTube-- number 20.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.120]   Pulled it down for inappropriate content.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.200]   Now, we've been blocked a lot of times for copyright violations.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.760]   Did you take your shirt off again?
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.280]   I don't think boxers are inappropriate content.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   But no, I was trying to figure out what it was.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   And we did show--
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   Did they pull you down or did they pull it down?
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.560]   Because more than one person complained that it was X.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.240]   And then they have a default that says--
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   Is that what it is?
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.840]   So YouTube will pull something down because--
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   They don't watch it.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   --three people have complained about something.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.040]   And they can complain about it from whatever reason.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040]   And there's no reason for it.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   It's like the barrier brigade we have a dig.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   Like a bunch of people get together.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   Yeah, of course.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   And they are all in all of a sudden a question.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   But at least you are dig.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   This is-- yeah, I have-- there's nobody you can call at Google.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.680]   No, you kind of get swallowed up.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.160]   It's literally like if more than three people flag you.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   It's kind of frustrating.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   So that makes me--
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   So that makes me-- --you know that there's nothing wrong with your video.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   Yeah, there's not.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.560]   Did you get it back up on YouTube?
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   How do you get it back up?
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.360]   Well, you appeal-- I mean, I know you never--
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   Who do you appeal to the more people there?
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   You have a question.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   You appeal to a Python script.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   Support.py.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.360]   Help me.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   You have a publisher account though, right?
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   You have a hardcore account.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   They don't give you a priority supporter at all?
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   Hell no.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   You get nothing.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.240]   It's-- you know, I'll tell you what it reminds me a little bit of face.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.160]   It's the same thing with Facebook, which is--
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.040]   Yeah, Facebook's great.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.560]   And if you're a business and you have to have a page on Facebook, but I always tell people,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   but don't count on it because if Facebook for any reason could pull it down, and who
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   are you going to complain to?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.960]   They have half a billion users.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.040]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.280]   So I-- and I can't really complain.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   YouTube's free.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   It's given us a lot of free bandwidth.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.480]   It's got to be hard for YouTube at that scale of users to be able to support something.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.120]   Yeah, I completely understand that.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.640]   It's just a little bit frustrating.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.640]   You know what?
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   I think it was we-- there's a new iPad game from it.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   Have you played this yet?
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   Rage HD?
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   Oh, I saw the demo for this.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   It's just a demo, right?
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   It's not full game.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   No, it's a full game now.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   It's out.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   It's out.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   And let me tell-- oh, you-- okay, well, I'm going to have to put it out here.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   Obviously, I have to show you because--
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   You have the thickest iPad case I've ever seen in my life.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   Well, that's because I don't want my MacBook ear to feel bad, so I have a nice--
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.200]   It makes it feel more like it's-- you know.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.920]   You know, one of the things YouTube also does is that people will probably realize if
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.520]   they have songs that are copywritten, it'll automatically get picked up by some algorithm
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.720]   that works the same way as the likes of a Shazam or work.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.400]   And I recognize that there's a copywritten song and pull it down.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.760]   However, if you were one of those people that does, like, say a lip dub of something
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.520]   and you put the entire song, or you do a recreation of someone else's song and you do
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.440]   your version of it, YouTube has the relationships with most of the larger recording studios,
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.160]   though, well, they will put ads on that.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   I love that.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.520]   I give the money not to you, the creator, like, so if I go sing a song, if someone else
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.840]   says, I get nothing.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   And even if it's seen several million times, now, who will get money is the studio that
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.000]   owns that song.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.080]   So YouTube has got a JK wedding dance, right, which where the people came out dancing and
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.280]   it was a Chris Brown song, I think it was.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.560]   And so the studio that made the song, instead of pulling it, which they could have done,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.840]   or cutting the audio, which they could have done, said, "Oh, well, just put an ad there."
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   It went back right to the top of the chart.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   Which is good, yeah.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.200]   But a lot of times now, by default, those songs will get recognized automatically and
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.800]   based on the deals that YouTube already has with certain recording studios, they will
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.920]   basically put the ads on there and give that money 100% to the studio.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.200]   So you as the guy who's doing a version of that song, you just have to be knowing that
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   someone else is song.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   We've lost him.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.680]   I'm willing to get the views, but the money's not mine.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.840]   We're not going to get Kevin back.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   How do I shoot?
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   Down and lower right.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   There's also ways around that also with the music, isn't there where you can speed up
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.120]   or slow down and you can't be detected as easily.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.600]   So I've heard kind of like, "Oh, all kinds of ways to game the system."
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   Oh, the graphics on this thing are amazing.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.440]   So this is it, the guys who did Doom, and they made it for the iPhone.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.640]   It's 99 cents on the iPhone.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.680]   A buck 99 for that game with high def graphics on the iPad.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.760]   It's funny, I feel like shooting like this going...
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.240]   I know.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.200]   There is a game where you're controlling World War II, anti-aircraft gun and you...
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   Wow.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   You guys want to play?
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   You're passing around.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   Hey, congratulations to our friend Jay Adelson, who I know is watching.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.640]   He has a job.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   So that's exciting.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.600]   We interviewed him a couple of weeks ago.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.440]   We do a thing at four o'clock on Wednesday's.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.080]   Tom Merritt and I interview a big name.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.720]   Gary Vaynerchuk, your friend Gary is coming up Wednesday to interview him.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.120]   But we interviewed Jay and he said, "Being an entrepreneur is addictive and I'm trying
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.520]   to come down.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.760]   My wife's helping me get this monkey off my back."
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.040]   He said, "The excitement of it, because we were talking about digging and the highs
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.280]   and lows and the nerve-racking nature of it."
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.040]   He says, "No, but I love that.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   I'm addicted to that."
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.680]   Did you feel that way or was it stressful?
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.480]   There's a lot of fun.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.520]   I think that the thing that's stressful is...
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.760]   Pull the mic up a little bit.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   Okay, sorry.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   I think that it's...
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.240]   Did you ship with the headphones on too?
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.240]   Yeah, you don't need to.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   You can hear me, right?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   Yeah, I can.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   I'm so...
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.640]   It's a lot of fun, but it's definitely you have to be willing to give yourself some time
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   to reset because you can go really hard for a couple of years.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   I think that's what Jay was doing.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.240]   He was plowing through the entire thing.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.640]   So Jay took a couple months off here or several months, like four or five months before he
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   started his next thing.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   He's back at it.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.520]   I'm going to do the same thing going on the holidays here.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   I'm going to take a couple of weeks off and just let myself just...
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.920]   Well, I haven't had a real vacation.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.160]   I'm going to take two weeks off.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.640]   You need it because you get really stressed out.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   You do.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   You need two months off, though, dude.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.680]   Yeah, I wish I could do that, but we'll see.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.440]   So Jay got a job at...
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   Simple Geo.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   Which is what?
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.120]   It's a geo-location storage company.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.760]   So essentially, if you're building something new, like a four-square, go-all-o, whatever,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.480]   you need to build out a new type of architecture to our back end to support that.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.120]   So it's an infrastructure for these, okay?
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   Right.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   So that's a little smart.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   So that's a little smart.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   So that's a little smart.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.120]   Because that's where data is different.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.560]   It's not like storing it in a standard like MySQL database and you're all good.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.920]   You have to go from a point and then go out from there.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.960]   And so in order to query that type of data...
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   Yeah, it's a different type of database that they use.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.560]   I don't know, claim to know all the kind of hardcore stuff that they do.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   But essentially what they're doing is they're creating layers of data.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.520]   So you'd be able to go in and say, "Okay, here's a pinpoint.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.040]   Let's say this particular office here.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.160]   Show me around this area all the Flickr photos.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.440]   Show me all the four-square check-ins.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.720]   Show me all the go-all stuff.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.400]   Show me the temperature of that day, that time and day.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.880]   So they're doing a bunch of different stuff.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.720]   So if you have anything that's location aware, it's like the S3 or EC2 for location stuff.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.800]   I think about who made the money in the gold rush.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.480]   Some miners did, but mostly it was Levi's because they sold the pants and the picks.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.800]   That's where you make money, right?
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   That's what they're betting on.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   So we'll see.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.400]   You sell the stuff that they...
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.280]   Who knows who's going to win four-square places?
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.640]   Let's go walla.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.680]   But if you make the data that they all need, you're guaranteed to win.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   Joe Stump has started.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   He was a dig engineer.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   Yes?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   So Joe's a dig engineer.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.920]   A bunch of x-dig people, like four or five of them over there.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Cool.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   It's awesome.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   Let's see.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   News.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.640]   Steve Ballmer throws a chair at effing Google.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.000]   I love it when Steve loses it.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.640]   I think this is one of the best things that Steve does.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.400]   A reliable source.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.720]   This is according to John Patel.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.440]   Passed along a legal document in the ongoing lawsuit between Google and Microsoft over
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.400]   Google's hiring of Kai Fu Lee.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.240]   The document is the declaration of Mark Lekowski in the case.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.400]   Lekowski was a distinguished engineer at Microsoft who defected to Google in 2004.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.840]   His statement makes for some pretty interesting reading to say the least.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.080]   The statement reads in part, "Prior to joining Google, I set up a meeting on or about November
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.520]   11, 2004 with Steve Ballmer to discuss my planned departure."
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.080]   At some point in the conversation, Mr. Ballmer said, "Just tell me it's not Google.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.840]   I told him it's Google."
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.000]   At that point, Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room, hitting a table
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.480]   in his office.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.400]   Mr. Ballmer then said, "F-ing Eric Schmidt is an effing ****.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.480]   I'm going to effing bury that guy.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   I've done it before.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   I'll do it again.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.280]   I'm going to frackin' kill Google."
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.520]   He then spun around.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.320]   His head exploded and he fell over.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   Frackin'.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   So he was a silon.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   He was a silon.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   This is awesome.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   This is 2004.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   Wow.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.080]   They're still waning, Mr. Ballmer.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.960]   Is it like that Zadi in the Internet TV wars?
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.640]   You would be surprised.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.480]   It's very much like this.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.120]   It's actually quite civil.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.600]   It seems like, anyway, it's still that small community that's not making that much money.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.480]   So we're all very friendly with each other at this point.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   I think that when you do get to the point of Google and Microsoft, your head does tend
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.560]   to explode a little bit more rapidly than probably if you didn't have that much to lose.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.560]   You said the key thing.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.120]   None of us making any money, so this is really better.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.560]   At this point, the stakes are low.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.080]   The stakes are low.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.200]   That makes very friendly people.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:55.600]   But I can understand the frustration behind having an employee that you probably find
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   really valuable.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.560]   All of a sudden, leaving to go work for see her.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.680]   I think Jim Lauderback threw a chair at Eileen when she left there, which was rated, didn't
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   he?
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   Eileen's a home figure.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.000]   We were very glad to get Eileen.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.040]   I mean, to actually Jim called me up and said, "Stop poaching my employees.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   It's just Eileen."
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.200]   I hear a laughing guy.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.800]   Eileen also lives how much closer here to here, I guess?
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.640]   She moved closer, yeah.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.400]   We're kind of in the middle of nowhere.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.840]   And so now Eileen and Tom work together again because they work together tech TV?
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.400]   Well, they are, I believe, hitched in holy matrimony.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.040]   So it really doesn't...
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.360]   Zadi, are you and Steve and Iam?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.160]   We are, we're married.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   In holy matrimony.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   We are.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.800]   We've been married for a couple of years, but we've been together for a really long time.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   Steve Wolf, of course.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.400]   Now, Steve, but besides producing your shows, he also works at Blip TV, right?
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:57.200]   Yeah, he's just started being the...
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.480]   Are we all supposed to pause?
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.920]   Yeah, we're all supposed to freeze right now.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   Just freeze.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.560]   Wait until she comes back?
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.560]   That's polite.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   That's the polite thing to do.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   Like just hold your hands.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.120]   Are you doing the whole piece?
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.720]   I live long and prosper.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.320]   And there she goes.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.520]   So you're talking about having...
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.880]   Who's idea was it to build a business on Skype?
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   Oh, me!
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.360]   Oh, we've been trying to do Skype stuff between Ella and New York last week.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.000]   It's just a pain in the ass.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.320]   If somebody can find an alternative Skype.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.840]   You need to build your own.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.360]   Like our own software?
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   Like Leo's Skype?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   Leo's Skype?
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   Lipe.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360]   Lipe?
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   It's not that hard.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   You know, Steve Gibson...
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.400]   How are you trying to reach is currently unavailable?
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.160]   Steve Gibson, I'd have to get a British lady to do all our announcements.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.640]   I thank you for calling Leo Lipe.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.000]   Leo's not here right now.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.880]   Steve Gibson was going to write something like that.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.680]   And then he said, "Oh, Skype does it fine."
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.120]   Well, maybe we should go see it back to work.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   I bet you can.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.040]   You probably do more video conferencing to a studio than anyone else I bet.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   You know what?
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.280]   Like CNN does a bunch of people that Skype in nowadays because you can...
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.280]   But nobody does this.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.920]   Nobody has the Skype of source.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   No, it's great.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.320]   When Colleen built that, ESPN called her and said, "How'd you do that?"
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.040]   He said, "It's all on the blog.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   We don't hide anything."
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.280]   But you don't do the 3D imaging into the studio like that.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   No, I don't.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   You remember that.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.280]   You were fine to reach the conference.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   You know who did that?
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   Well, you guys wouldn't know him.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280]   But...
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   Steve Borman.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.280]   David Borman.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   David Borman.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   Do you know David?
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   Yeah, because he consulted with...
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   When they built the tech lives set.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   Yeah, well, he did exactly.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   He did...
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.280]   Well, that's right.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   He came by.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.280]   He was a guy who did Ziff Davis' first.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   And I remember they also blamed him when Bloomberg decided to make their TV screen.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.000]   The actual TV was the upper right corner and the rest of it was stock tickers and lower
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.480]   third chasing headlines.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.080]   There was a tiny little corner up there.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.480]   Yeah, that was Borman.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.200]   Nice guy, David, actually.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   He had...
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.120]   She should have been...
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   She's back now?
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   Okay.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   Eileen's amazing.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   No wonder you were mad.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.520]   She just fixed the Skype.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   She just gave it.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   You should use her.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.680]   But last thing that she was doing at Revision3, when she left, because you were talking about
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.240]   how you don't want to necessarily have a show that couplers just Android or just iPhone
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   or...
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   She's doing app judgment.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.440]   Yeah, so she was producing it, but then she was so good at it and was so involved in
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440]   it that she was just...
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.840]   You know, she was talent for the show.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   No, I've already told her.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840]   No, he's not to have her.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.800]   I haven't told her yet, but I'm going to tell her.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   Because we were gonna...
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.640]   I'll tell her later.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   We were gonna do it...
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   Hi, Zati, I'm sorry.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   Oh, it's cool.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   You forgive me?
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.440]   I think it was my fault.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.880]   Oh, did you push a button?
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   No, not at all.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880]   I just dropped out at all.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   Yes, guys.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.560]   What are you gonna do?
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   Windows, 25 years old.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   Crazy.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:42.760]   Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of Windows 1.01.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.800]   Paul Thorett had a picture on his blog.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.280]   I have Windows 1.0.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   You have...
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   Oh, you never opened the box.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   You donated...
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.280]   I know, I did not donate.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   You lent it to the computer history museum, and it's on display right now, sealed Windows
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.280]   1.0.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.480]   It says like, "On loan from Kevin Rose."
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.440]   Oh, isn't that great?
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.880]   So you know what it's gonna be like a bottle of wine that they open and there's nothing
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   in it?
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   Right, totally.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   Sand.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   Kevin said it around, and I can hear the disc.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   You can hear the disc.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.360]   The five and a quarter floppies in there.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.120]   This was basically at the time, it was just a shell on top of DOS.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   I mean, it wasn't even...
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   It was just a program.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.040]   I remember I used to use Norn Commander or NC Small, so you could just go up and down
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.840]   and check your file directory, and then for multitasking, 'cause you couldn't do it
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.840]   before, I would use like...
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.840]   No, I would not drink this one.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   Desk view.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   Desk view.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   I used desk view.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.440]   And then I used Zotti's way too young to remember any of this stuff.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.520]   Zotti, what was the first operating system you remember using?
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   My first computer was a Tandy.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   It was pretty good.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   It was pretty good.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   That's pretty good.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   That's good.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.760]   And then I went from that, I went to an Apple to CI Street, so it's free to Apple.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.560]   So you're older than you look?
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.200]   I'm actually 86 years old.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.560]   You started when you were one.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.360]   Twenty-five years old.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.000]   On the one hand, twenty-five years isn't really that long.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Something long.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.680]   On the other hand, in computer terms, it's a long time.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   Do you remember using it soon?
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.360]   Do you remember specifically not using Windows?
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.600]   In a way, the same reason that I was embarrassed to maybe use something like AOL.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.040]   No, I'm not going to use Windows.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.040]   It's too slow.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   It's too slow.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   And it was for all the noobs in a way.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.920]   Well, it was just really slow.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.080]   Like when Windows 3.1 was out, if you had like a 386, it was like, it was...
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   DOS is faster.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   I could change directory to the indirect I want, execute any file I want to run.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.760]   I didn't use Windows until Windows 95.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.840]   That was like the OS 10 moment for me.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   Like I never used Mac OS.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   Do you remember going in?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   I remember using 3.1.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   But I never really wanted to.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   Did you edit your own exact op-at and configs this file?
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.840]   Oh hell yeah.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   You have to.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   You have to get the memory.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   So you'd rem out some stuff?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   DMM386.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   Do you need a little extra?
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   You'd go and rem out a couple things.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   Sure.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   But I didn't really use Windows until 95.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   I remember using it usually to run certain things or to check out what was going on.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.840]   But I never really adopted it until 95, which is crazy because that's only 15 years ago.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   No.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   Steve was there by the way.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   He was here.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   Here's a little promotional video for I think this is for Windows.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   One point out.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   How much do you think this advanced operating environment is worth?
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   Wait just one minute before you answer.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   Watch as Windows integrates.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.840]   Flowless123 with Miami Vice.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   Now we can take this Ferrari and paste it right into Windows White.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   Now how much do you think Microsoft Windows is worth?
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   Don't answer.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   Wait, you see Windows White and Windows Paint.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   And listen to what else you get at no extra charge.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   The MS-DOS executive, an important calendar.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.840]   A card file, a no-pad-o-clock, a control panel, a terminal, a principal.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   The clock is amazing.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   The clock is amazing.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   And you believe it.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   Reversity.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   Reversity.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.840]   Reversity.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.840]   We didn't have solitary yet.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   How much did you guess?
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   500?
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   1000?
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   Even more?
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   No, it's just $99.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   That's right.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.840]   That seems pretty pricey.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   There's a crowd that you have $29.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   It's pretty much $29.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   That's pretty much $29.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   That seems pretty pricey.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   There's a crowd that you have $29.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840]   That's pretty much $29.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   It's pretty much $29.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840]   It's pretty much $29.

[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   It's pretty much $29.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   She was sentenced to reeducation through labor for accusations that her retweet of a message
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   led to her disturbing social order.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   She used her Wang Y I O 9 Twitter account to repost a tweet from her fiance.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.840]   The original message, well, I'll tell you, the original message was anti-Japanese demonstrations
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   smashing Japanese products that was all done years ago by Guo Kwan,
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   the original tweet, red.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   It's no new trick.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   And then I guess if you really wanted to kick it up a notch,
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   you'd immediately fly to Shanghai to smash the Japanese Expo pavilion.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   And then she retweeted it adding charge, angry youth.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   You're going to jail.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   Why aren't you glad we live in a country where you could tweet crap and not?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   I thought Twitter was blocked in China.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   It was when I was there.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   It's blocked in China, except obviously you can proxy around it.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   So I think a lot of people should get control for proxy.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   No, well, and the content.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   I mean, the content got their attention.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   The intellectuals have been doing that for going around.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   Because the Chinese government, I mean, I guess it's not their job to give an official word
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   on why they arrest anyone.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   They said it was for, you know, inciting angry youth.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.840]   So Dick Costala, who's the CEO of China, I can understand why to get a little angry,
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   tweets, dear Chinese government, year-long detentions for sending a sarcastic tweet are
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.840]   either the way forward nor the future of your great people.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   You know what?
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   Good for good on him.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.840]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   I'm sure the State Department called him immediately and said, "Hey, dude, you can't do that."
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   But good on him.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   Somebody's got to stand up.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   Yep.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   That's a little hard of a calling.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   I'm going to get Zadi back.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.840]   The person whom you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   Please leave a message.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   Keep this up.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   We're going to have to pay that to Skype woman royalties.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   Why don't you get, what is it, telepresence to sponsor and give you some of that stuff?
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.840]   You need to get it to everyone else.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   No, we got it.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.840]   Cisco, that's it.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   Yeah, we got this.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   You know, tell me the, tell me the, you mean...
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   What's your new anxiety back?
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   Okay.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   This thing is like, what, six or seven hundred bucks?
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   Oh!
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   Oh shoot, you do have it.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   You mean?
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   Oh, here we go.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   You mean?
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   It's amazingly clear and lifelike.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   Maybe we should send this to Zadi.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   Bring friends to your living room on your HD television.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   Be together with a touch button.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   Well, we bought it just because we want to see.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   Oh, you bought it.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   Is this, oh, has any, yeah.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   I can buy everything.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Is this, oh, has any secret sauce?
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   Oh God, Kevin, you're strong.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   You get that from me.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   So you put that on your TV?
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   Why is it so heavy then?
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   I don't know.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   Maybe the TV, maybe it comes with a TV.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   It auto at the price.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   All right, we're going to get Zadi back in just a bit.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   Before we do, I would like to mention my good friends at Citrix.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   They make a good product, a great product.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   I don't know if you remember, Kevin, we used this from time to time on the screen savers.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   We would reach into people's computers and fix them.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   They've come a long way since then.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   Go to Assist Express is now the number one remote solution worldwide.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   That's according to Frost and Sullivan.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   They're an industry analyst group that focuses on this sector because it's easy to use.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   It's affordable.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   It's secure, 128-bit SSL, which means that your support, for instance, can be a Starbucks.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   It's a good product.

[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   It's a good product.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   It's a good product.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   It's a good product.

[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   It's a good product.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   It's a good product.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   It's a good product.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.840]   It's a good product.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   It's a good product.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   It's a good product.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   It's a good product.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   It's a good product.

[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.840]   It's a good product.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   I remember when you fly your exposure.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   You're flying your higher and the cosmic rays are hitting you.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   I can see.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:01.840]   I know that UV rays don't go through most car windows even.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.840]   I don't think it's UV though.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   It's not UV.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   It's a good product.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.840]   It's a good product.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.840]   It's a good product.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   What do I have?
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   They've never, ever had a problem.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   We talked with Ray Maxwell on the radio show today.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   Ray, would you do some research on this?
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   This is all they do.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   They interrogate you.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   They have military officers who sit there.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   They don't do that because these are highly trained people.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   It's slower.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   It's more expensive.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   What was it before the TSA?
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   It was employees of the airports or employees of --
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.840]   Because it was before the department of medicine.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.840]   Before 9/11.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   They're taking your laptop out.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.840]   They're yelling you to go through the procedures of using the machine.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   I don't know what the overhead is and all the economics around it.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   Do you take your iPad out?
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   Apparently the air you don't have to.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   They said you don't have to.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   I'm not sure I'd encourage people to do this.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.840]   I'll take the Frisk, please.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.840]   It's humiliating to them as well as you.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   Everybody should see this happening.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   Civil disobedience?
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.840]   What do you think?
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   I'm all for a solution.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   I can still re-identify the fact that it's not most effective way to do it.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   It's not the best way to do it.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   It's intrusive.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.840]   There are a lot of TSA Twitter feeds, but none of them,
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   according to TechCrunch, are actually a TSA except for this one.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   TSA Blog Team.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   This is where you can get quick notes and updates concerning the TSA blog.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   Remember Blogger Bob?
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.840]   I don't know if he's still around.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.840]   As long as they can't capture pictures of your junk,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   that's an interesting question.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   I really don't care if I'm going through and somebody really wants to
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.840]   frickin' take a look at your goods.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   They say...
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   It's not the radiation.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   I don't want to do the radiation stuff.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   They say that they don't.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   Here from Gizmodo is the U.S. Marshals in a Florida federal courthouse
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   saved 35,000 images on their scanner.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   These are all images of people.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   Now this was a lower quality scanner, so these are not particularly revealing,
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   but they saved them.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   The TSA says, "We're not going to save any of them."
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.840]   That's exactly what the federal marshals said.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   You know what?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   I bet you these were not deleted on accident.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   Yeah, of course not.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   It's like Google.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   They want to delete them.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   It's so much overhead to like, "Oh, shoot, we got to go through and delete it."
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   Supposedly these don't survive.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   They're deleting everything.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   And then they got to secure delete because all they're doing is telling the data that's
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   not there even though it's there.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.840]   Kevin, you're a fashionista.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   Fashionista?
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.840]   Look at that slayer T-shirt he's wearing.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   Yes, that's awesome.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.840]   Have you seen the new boutiques.com?
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.840]   No, I have not.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.840]   Oh yeah, this is a beautiful site for people who loved shop for fine fashion wear.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.840]   You know it's kind of social.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   It's neat you can find somebody that you like Ashley Olson or Mary Kate or Jennifer Goodwin
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.840]   or a variety of movie stars and see what fashions...
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   I bet Dario would like this.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   Jamie Lynn Sigler from the Sopranos, Eve, Anna Pacwen.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   Love her.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   Sookie Stackhouse.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   And then it's let you follow that person.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   You can follow.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   You can see what fashions.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   Just look at this site.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   Take a wild guess, Kevin.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.840]   What company owns this site?
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.840]   A wild guess.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   D-D-D-D-D.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   D-D-D-D-D.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   D-D-D-D-D.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   Take a wild guess who owns this boutiques.com.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   Maybe if we go...
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   I would say for the font choice, probably Bloomingdale's.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.840]   Bloomingdale's.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.840]   Those are good guesses.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   Let's just go to the help page.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.840]   Maybe the help page.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   You will.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   Leela Borton said hi.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.840]   That would be awesome.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   I know.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   Teaks.com.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   It's not coming up.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   I'll tell you who owns it.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   Google owns it.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   No way.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.840]   Google.com.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.840]   Wait, oh, so this is all because Google's all algorithm based.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.480]   Basically, they're using the same kind of thing that Amazon uses where you can take a picture
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.840]   of something and it tells you what it is and where to buy it.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   Right?
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   I mean, as far as I could tell, you cannot buy stuff on boutiques.com.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   You're just following people.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   Oh, see, they should like to work by the stuff.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.840]   They got to make it so you can make it look like it.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   Well, maybe you can.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   Let me see.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   Save, share, love, hate.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.840]   Maybe I can...
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   Maybe Google gets a percentage.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.840]   There we go.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.840]   Here's a rag and bone.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   The Indigo...
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.840]   Well, I like that.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   Add the bag.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.840]   There we go.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   Maybe I can buy it.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.840]   I got to select the size.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   Two or four.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.840]   I guess it's not for me.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   Email address.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   Yeah, sign in.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   I guess you can buy it.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   So that's a clever, isn't it?
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   You think Marissa Meyer did that?
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   I don't know.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   That seems like she's in charge of location based services.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   Is there a guy in section for this or is it?
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   No.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   Okay.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   Can you believe that?
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   No.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   That makes me...
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   That makes...
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.200]   Now I feel bad for saying that Google is employing an algorithm that searches everything.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   I guess it's just women.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   There she is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   She's back.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   I'm telling you, time Warner Cable in LA is not the most...
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   No.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.200]   So we were talking about boutiques.com.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   Have you seen this site?
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   I didn't want to be sexist, so I did it while you were gone.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   Oh, that's good.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   This is a shopping site for women.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   And you can explore the boutiques, celebrity boutiques.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   You can follow a celebrity, see what they like, what they wear.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   You can buy it.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   This is what Anna Pakwin wears.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   They have a lovely rag and bone indigo corset dress.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   And these fine...
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   I think that would look good on you, Leo.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   Frequent baker.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   Well, no, they don't have it in my size.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   It's only size two and four.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   So I was saying, who do you think...
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.200]   Now that's taken us to Barney, so I would then buy it in Barney's.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   But who do you think owns this site?
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   I did it to Kevin.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   He didn't know it's Google.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   Really?
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   This is a new Google site.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   Did you follow the Google security hole that allowed...
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   No, but I heard about this.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.200]   A tech crunch did the story on this.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.200]   I don't know.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   What's the deal?
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   So if a guy created this website that exploited this hole, Google has fixed it.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   Google hasn't said anything about it.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   But let me see if I can find the fella's name.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   Vahi G. He's a 21-year-old Armenian.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   He created a website which is now down.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   If you went to the site, it would say, "Oh, hi."
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   And it would then send...
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   If you were currently logged in, if you had the cookie for any Google account, it would then send you an email at your Google email address just by going to his website.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   So in effect, he was able to harvest your Gmail address just by visiting a site.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   I'm sure there are a lot of websites that would love to know how to do that.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   Absolutely.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   Google says they fixed it.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   Vahi says they've never talked to me.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   I wanted to tell them about this, but they never said it contacted me, so I put up a site.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   Google says, "The issues resolve.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   We fix the issue in the Google Apps Script API that could have allowed for emails to be sent to Google users without their permission if they visit a specially designed website while signed in.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   We immediately remove the site that demonstrated the issue and disabled the functionality soon after."
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   Little bug there.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   Google's been pretty good at keeping things secure.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   I feel as though my Gmail has never been compromised.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   All my stuff is pretty...
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   Felicia Day's got hacked this week.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   Is that a password?
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   Wasn't that a password?
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.200]   Was that a password?
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   Like she too easy to get from that.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   She probably had an easy secret question.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   Something like that.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.200]   Right.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   Exactly.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   Here's the thing to remember.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   I'm sure you all have done this.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.200]   Type your cell phone.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   Then what?
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   Type to your cell phone so you can reset your password and feed your cell phone.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   So what they got was her backup email account.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   So they got that too.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   Yeah, see I don't do that.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   And so she couldn't reclaim the password because she didn't have access to her backup email account.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   Right.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   But they also allow you to set...
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   And everybody who has Gmail right now to go to Gmail, go to the security settings and attach a cell phone to it.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   Unless a person attacker has your cell phone.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   I mean if they have your cell phone you're out of luck.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   Right.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   As long as you continue to have possession of your cell phone you can send the reset code to your cell phone and get them out of your system.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   Right.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   So do that now if you haven't done that.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   If Felicia had done that she'd be okay.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   I'm sure she's done it now.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   Was this also because there were kind of third party apps that kind of were tied to this?
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   Like Facebook Connect and all of that.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   I mean how...
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   You know initially they thought it was a Facebook Connect exploit.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   Right.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   And then I think that they're now saying no it's not.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   I don't know if we'll ever know exactly what happened.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   Well I'm still not sure how the exploit worked.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   We don't know.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   We just know that she lost her account.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   Are you mean the other?
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   That's what happens to them.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.200]   I mean you're logged in so you've got...
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   It's kind of like fire sheep.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   You ever play with fire sheep?
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   That's a fun one.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   So fire sheep...
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   Well you know so you don't have to keep re-logging into let's say Facebook every time you change pages.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   It sends you a token that identifies you uniquely.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   The problem is it sends that token unless it's on SSL the whole time in the clear.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   So fire sheep is that Firefox plugin that says their watch is the tokens flying around.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   grabs him says "Ah Kevin's on his Facebook account.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   David's on his Twitter account.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   I have it on here.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   It's really quite fun.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   In fact you notice we have a password now because you notice we have a password now on our open access.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   That's why we put it on.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   I didn't install fire sheep that scares me.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   Oh it's so much fun.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   It's highly illegal.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   But no one would ever arrest you.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   Actually...
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   Hey you don't need to tell me to install it.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   System...
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   So you put it on.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   It's really cool.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   It shows you all the people were logged into the services it supports which is quite a long list including wordpress.com.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   Then you double click on their page.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   It shows their pictures too so you can look around the coffee shop and say "Oh she's cute."
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   You double click it.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   You're now in her Facebook account.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   You can post messages.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   You can look at her pictures.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   It's as if you're her because you stole her token.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   And from Facebook's point of view your her still logged in.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   This is not fixed yet on Facebook.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   It is not Google.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   It's one of the reasons I think Google put HTTPS on all Gmail.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   Errington wrote that Facebook would consider this a feature.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   Makes it easy to log in.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   Crazy.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   Another story I think.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   Go ahead Zati.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   No, it's a good point.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   I mean sometimes I forget about how many different apps I'm kind of logged into at the same time.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   Until I kind of go back and check and I forget.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   I want to see if it worked with Dig actually.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   I think it did as a matter of fact.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   Did you know that?
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   I had no idea.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   It works with Dig.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   As I remember.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   Well it's just it works with anything that's unencrypted.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   Well yeah they initially the guy who wrote it only supported you know.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   It's Code Butler.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   C-O-D-E-B-U-T-L-E-R.github.com or .NET.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   I can't remember what Dig.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   GitHub is.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   Maybe he's not here.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   If you Google code Butler.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   But yeah I'm pretty sure that Dig was one of the.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   But you know you don't.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.200]   You wouldn't know about this.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   This would be you have people who do this right?
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   Yes I do not.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   Security and stuff is all handled elsewhere.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   That is correct.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   Let me just see if I can see which services.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   It supports.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   Oh well we'll worry about that later.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   Here's a story you might like Kevin.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   Yes.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:22.200]   Google offered to buy Twitter for two and a half to four billion dollars and Twitter left.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   Ha ha ha ha.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   Not nearly enough they said.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   In fact the offer was characterized as.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   According to the business insider.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   Insulting.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   I don't think four billion dollars is ever insulted.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   I can't imagine being I'd love to be insulted like that.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   Seriously.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   This was about three months ago.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   Now this is.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   Because there was a rumor that Twitter is raising another round at a four billion dollar valuation as we speak.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   That was a rumor.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   That's something that I know.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   Right.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   How much is Twitter worth you think.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   It's if Facebook's worth thirty five.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   Twitter's in the four billionish kind of range.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   Because it's about a quarter the size of Facebook.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   They have about 125 million users.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   Two hundred now.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   So it's bigger than that.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   And most of them are active right.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   I don't know.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   Ah that's the question.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   I know that Facebook's very active.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Right.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   50% of their user base comes back every day.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   Every day.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   I thought it was more every week anyway.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   No I'm sure it's every day.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   I go back every few hours.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   And I don't even have a Facebook account.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.200]   I thought you just started it up again.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   I did.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   I had to.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   How can you cover Facebook if you don't have an account?
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   It's so.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   You can't cover it.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   So as much as it hurts me to do so.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   You have two accounts.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   You have a fan account as well.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   No I have a real account on a page.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   Do you have a.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   Do you use Facebook for its original intentions?
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   Yes.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   Okay.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   I mean because I think you get more.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   I think there's a lot of people.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   And I would have almost thought that you would have been one of those people that just accepts everyone,
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   You did.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   No, no.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   I did initially.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.200]   I had 5,000.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   Now I only accept hot chicks.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   That's the original.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   I believe that's the original use.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   There would be an amazing if you click on Leo's Facebook page.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   It's just like 500 really hot chicks.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.200]   Like you know I would except these hot chicks.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   You know I would except these hot chicks.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   You never asked to be my friends.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   I don't know.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   No it's like damn Leo's a baller.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   Look at this.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   It's like yeah.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.200]   It's pages of hot chicks.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   There is friends writing on his wall.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   Let me just.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   Actually you know that's a good question.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   I don't know who my friends are.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   See that's the only thing.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   I never know if it's you.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   I get a friend of us from Leo like every like couple months and I'm like.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   You never know.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.320]   If Feczera did that she said I know Leo doesn't have a Facebook account.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.320]   You're not Leo.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320]   Go away.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   And then I said no, no it's really me.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.960]   Are you the Leo that looks like?
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.040]   I'm the one that is I'm on a ball.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.440]   You're Peter Griffin.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   Peter Griffin.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.440]   You only had one ball pop or two.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.800]   I've had two pop in my life.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   That's the most amazing.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   Who drew this for you?
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   Isn't that great?
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   I would kill to have something like that.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   That's not fun.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   That is amazing.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   It does looks just like me.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.280]   I even commented on that footage.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.760]   It looks just like me.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:01.720]   My son got on my Facebook and he said let me take a picture of myself that looks like
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.800]   I'm stoned and put that as your profile picture.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:09.040]   Does he look high there or just wow?
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.560]   Your son has gotten so much older.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   I know.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.600]   How old is Henry?
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.600]   He's 16.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   Last night.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   He daughters in college.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.040]   He comes back from the Andre Nickatina concert across the street here.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.280]   That's a big rap, big Oakland rap star.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.440]   How's your relationship with your son on Facebook publicly?
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.720]   Oh no, I have no relationship.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   He won't let me.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   He won't friendly.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   Really?
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   Oh no.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   Neither of my kids will.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   Neither of my kids will friendly on Facebook.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.080]   Haven't you told if you fire them or whatever?
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   Fire.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   I just want a fire.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.080]   No, you know what?
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.080]   They're not that sophisticated.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:44.480]   They log in on my system and I've got the password saved of course.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   That's amazing.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.000]   Henry comes home last night after the rap concert.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.520]   He pokes his head in the door and says, "Can I have some friends over?"
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.480]   Like 15 minutes later, there's 20 girls in our hot tub.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   Oh, those are all your Facebook friends.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   Yeah, I feel like the one that I do, did you call into the hot tub and hang out?
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.160]   That cleared him out real quick.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.160]   Seriously.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.160]   Daddy's here.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.800]   No, I didn't, but I was like, "Keep it down, guys.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.840]   The cops are going to come."
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.840]   They were having quite a party up there.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.840]   That's cool.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   You're a cool parent like that.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   I'm not a cool parent.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.240]   I'm not a pop-shit-un rave at Leel Le Porte's house.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   You better live with it.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   That's good.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   Where do you draw the line?
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.240]   Well, I know.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   What was the weekend?
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240]   Somebody was starting lighting up some weed.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   I said, "Get it.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Get it.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Give me that."
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   You're like, "Puff puff pass."
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.040]   What are you doing?
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.560]   No, no.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.720]   You know, it's hard.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.320]   It's very difficult being a parent of a teenager.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.480]   As you might imagine these days, it's not easy to know exactly how to handle it.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   I don't know.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   We all talk.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.280]   We parents talk about this.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   Come back.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.560]   In just a bit, we're going to talk about the office.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.160]   They're doing a parody on Silicon Valley.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.160]   It's right.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   Ooh.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   That's awesome.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.560]   I don't know how I got woof fun here.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.440]   I'm sure I'll find the...
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.360]   Why is this on there?
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.360]   What is it?
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.360]   This is the website?
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   That's right.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.800]   This is Ryan's website.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.080]   Oh, my God.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.760]   I was fooled by it.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.320]   Oh, my God.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   This is Ryan.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   You know, the intern?
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.120]   I'm Ryan from woof.

[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.320]   I saw this in the office.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   On the office.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   The stories.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   Oh, it was on the office.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   Did I thought this was like someone sponsoring like who's watching?
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   I know.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   This is full of me.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   No.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   Hi.

[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.600]   So let's get started.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.720]   Click on to file.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.720]   Now open file.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.720]   Click file.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.800]   Now you see an option.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.800]   Start woof.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   Hi.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.800]   I'm Ryan, founder and your first friend on woof.com.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:13.480]   And then it says, "Do I buy you a woof?"
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.240]   What's the name of the start?
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.240]   Woof.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   At this time is W.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   Let's get started.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   He's a tick file.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.240]   I'll open file.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.840]   Now open file.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   And now you'll see an option.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   Every time I do it, he starts over.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.840]   That's a great option.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.640]   This is actually hysterical.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.920]   I have to say that's very funny.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.520]   That's the NBC show, The Office.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.480]   And he is actually one of the writers and executive producer of the show.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.960]   But he's also the intern.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.160]   And we'll come back with more Zadi Diaz is here from EpicFoo.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.320]   Zadi.com or what is the website for EpicFoo?
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.320]   How do I get there, Zadi?
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.960]   It's e-p-i-c-e-f-u.com.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   Dotcom.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   Dotcom.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   Dotcom.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.240]   And also Kevin Rose.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.400]   I don't know what Kevin's doing.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   He's like, what do you like a blogger, right?
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   I have a blog.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.520]   What is your buy on Twitter?
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.920]   I like tea and I climb rocks, right?
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:15.560]   Yeah, it says founder dig tech angel investor and I like tea and climb rocks.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.280]   How much angel investing are you doing a lot?
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:24.440]   It depends on, you know, I'd say probably four to six deals a year.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.760]   That's pretty good.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.160]   And is it with a goal to make money or is it with a goal to help people out?
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.160]   A little bit of both.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.160]   So, path is your latest.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.800]   Path is the latest, yeah.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.840]   And you know, so it's just, it's as a hobby and it's fun.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.400]   It's a lot of fun to see all these new startups.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.400]   I bet it is.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.400]   When they come out.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.400]   It's a big deal for them to have Kevin Rose on their list.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.560]   I mean, you probably don't have to put up a whole lot of money.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.520]   It's more, it's more just the presence.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.520]   Yeah, I think that's a value.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.160]   Well, you want to put money in if you think it's going to be huge.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.160]   The more you put in, the more you get.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   Right, exactly.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.360]   So that varies.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:59.960]   But I think angel investing, typically most angel investors will do anything from like,
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:05.720]   I don't know, 25 to super angels will do 200,000 in investment kind of thing.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:09.200]   So is Peter Thiel like the poster boy for all this?
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.200]   Because he's the guy.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   I don't think so.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.600]   Mark Zuckerberg came to and he gave him a few hundred thousand and now he has like 30%
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.320]   of a $35 billion company.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   Yeah, I mean, he's definitely-
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   That was a good move.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.320]   He's done well.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:25.240]   But I think that there's, you know, the people that I really look up to is a handful of,
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.080]   who's from the big angels out there that-
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.080]   I don't know, I'm pretty good friends.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.600]   Reid Hoffman is amazing.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   I like Chris Saka.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   Chris Saka is a friend.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   Chris Saka is an awesome.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.360]   He's kind of a, he's a really smart guy.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.200]   And I think he's really good morally and philosophically, which makes a difference, I think.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.360]   And a lot of, like he talks that up on his site.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.600]   You read the about it at lowercase capital and it's kind of inspiring, I think, to have
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   someone-
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.720]   Because a lot of the roles of some of these angels anyway is to try to be a mentor to
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   someone as well.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   Oh, for sure.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.560]   And then like, and also like, especially for you, I think that you're, you got such
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:58.320]   a, you got so much experience, but more, more so than that as an advisor based on like,
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.400]   you're just your skills as a, for UI and UX, I think, can help a lot.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.840]   That's when I sit down with a new company, it's not just like, they can take money from
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   anybody, right?
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.360]   It's not the cash, like you said, Leo.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.520]   It's really more along the lines of like, I'm launching something new, you know, help
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.560]   me not get screwed when I take my first round of funding.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   And I'm saying, well, you don't want to-
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.600]   Because you've been through it all before, you can kind of talk about it.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.320]   And you kind of come in as this independent guy who they know that is not going to screw
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.280]   them over, that's just there to try and help them out.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:31.680]   And that can apply to, you know, product features or raising capital or whatever it is they're
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   trying to do.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.520]   Find the right type of engineers.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.800]   A lot of people have a hard time hiring good engineers and that was one of the biggest
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.440]   hurdles I've ever had to deal with.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.040]   That's a tough, that's where there's a lot of competition for talent.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   That's tough.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.440]   So the Instagram guys are a great example.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.480]   I went and had tea with them probably about-
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.000]   Kevin, I don't know, a month ago.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Yeah, Kevin and Mike.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.280]   Mike, that's right.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   And I hung out with them and one of the things-
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   There's two of them.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.360]   There's two of them and they're growing like crazy at the time.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   This was a few weeks ago.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.520]   They were doing two uploads a second.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.800]   And they're sitting there saying like, how do we know, we think we know how we're going
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:11.360]   to scale this, but we need to get engineers that have done this before.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.080]   And so, you know, I hooked them up with a guy I know, a senior scaling engineer at Twitter
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.120]   that came over and then sat down with them and walked into stuff.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120]   That's another thing.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.600]   And you've mentioned this before, I find fascinating.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.000]   People at Dig, Facebook, Twitter-
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Oh, we all work together.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   All work together.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Absolutely.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.520]   You would think they'd be kind of competitive, but no, it's like we're helping everybody helps
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.520]   everybody out.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   I love that.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.240]   It's not to say that they're going to go work for that company, but they'll come in and
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.600]   spend an hour with them and sit down.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Are you all using Cassandra?
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   Is that why?
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.920]   No, no, Cassandra is good for things.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.920]   Twitter does.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   Facebook does.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   Twitter does certain things.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:45.880]   Facebook only does it for Facebook only does it for, I think, messages.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.560]   The high availability stuff.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.160]   They are more sharded, MySQL still, Facebook.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.160]   You're kidding.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.160]   I believe so.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   I think the both of it-
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.160]   I'm stunned.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.360]   Well, Cassandra, they forked it though.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.040]   They took it in another direction.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.080]   The version of Cassandra that they're running is not the one that everyone else has access
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   to.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   Okay.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.080]   So they're a little bit different.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   Twitter only uses it for certain things.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   They don't use it for, like, all the messages are not stored in Cassandra on Twitter.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.320]   Cassandra is a very high availability database that would be an alternative to say MySQL.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.040]   It's early days for that.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   It's very new.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   It's big uses it though.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   We were using it.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040]   We've-
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.040]   Dig four.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040]   That wasn't that big.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   Well, that was part of it.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.120]   We had some issues with it, but it's funny.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.440]   One of the guys that started Cassandra sent me an email and was like, "Hey, you know, you're
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.960]   slamming Cassandra, please don't do this blah, blah, blah."
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:38.280]   The whole thing is it's- there's certain things it's very good at, but you have to also pair
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.440]   the software with the right type of engineer.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   Right.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   I can debug it and figure out how to actually fix this problem.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.920]   Well, MySQL's like that too.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.880]   If you don't tune it, it's going to be like a dollar.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.840]   But it's a lot more stable than Cassandra is.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840]   They're both open source, right?
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.840]   Well, we were trying to use it for.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.440]   Yeah, they're both open source.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.840]   Anyway, it's- scaling is not easy.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.640]   Anyone can build a website that'll scale to a million, a couple million people a month.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.640]   That's not hard.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.240]   You get into 10 million, 20 million, 30 million plus a month.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.360]   That's difficult, especially when it's a right intensive application.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.880]   It's not just reads that you can throw into a big, like caching, like net scaler.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:16.040]   Like you need to have the right talent to figure out which direction to go.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.200]   Because there's 10 different solutions out there.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   So you know, like which one do you choose and why and it's hard.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.360]   David and I are going, "We don't care.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.000]   We're glad we're doing what we're doing."
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   No, I mean-
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.320]   I still remember like, you know, I'm not a developer, but I still remember like my-
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.200]   I've been pretty like enmeshed in the whole thing for the past four plus years just into
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.720]   working with developers and dealing with developers and talking about people's and
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.520]   their startups and their scaling problems.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.360]   And I still remember when you came to me about talk to me about Dig and your first program.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.440]   And you said, "We knew we were growing so big when we realized that we were no longer
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440]   building the site.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440]   We were optimizing queries.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.080]   That's all we were doing is optimizing queries."
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.960]   The biggest mistake I ever made at Dig when it comes to talent without a doubt is that I
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.200]   hired for skill-
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.040]   skill set and not talent.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.520]   The difference is that you can hire an awesome PHP programmer, a great PHP programmer that
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.280]   will come in and rewrite your PHP, make it super optimized.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.320]   And then when all of a sudden PHP is no longer the solution, when it gets to the end of where
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.840]   you can take it, they don't know how to jump to Python or C or a low-level language.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.960]   They can't go up and down the stack like you'd want a developer.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:27.760]   So we were sitting there at one point with 1520 really awesome advanced PHP developers
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.120]   that didn't know what to do next.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.040]   And so we're sitting there like, "Ah, well, we really wanted to rewrite this in Python,
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.600]   but we don't have a Python expert or we want to do this piece in C."
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.040]   And so, hire for the talent of the engineer.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.400]   They can always learn a new language if they're a skilled engineer.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.400]   How do you assess for that?
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.520]   How do you decide for between talent?
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.720]   You really, I hate to say it, but there's either a crazy rock star prodigy engineer that you
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.800]   have come in that you can just tell they're really good at jumping up and down the stack.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.040]   Or you hire people out of MIT, Stanford, whatever it may be that have that background, that
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.880]   have that discipline that you know are going to be able to make those jumps around the
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   different languages.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.880]   So that's interesting.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.840]   So it is important then that they have the training degree.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.480]   Well, when it comes to algorithm, guys, absolutely.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.960]   It's really hard to find someone that's really advanced to algorithm engineer that
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.920]   doesn't have the formal training.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   Let's take a break.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:26.240]   Come back with more Kevin Rose, David Prager from Revision 3's out of DS from Epic Food.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.120]   We're talking about the weeks.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.840]   Really, not even about the weeks tech news.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.040]   We're just sitting around BS in which is really all to it ever was.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.040]   There's a bunch of people talking about what's going on in their lives.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.800]   Right now I'd like to talk a little bit about a great car, a great automobile.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.040]   I know Kevin drives a Porsche, but I drive him a Mustang and a little later on we're going
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.680]   to have a little race back down to Petaluma's back streets.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.440]   I just want to warn the CHP stay away.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.920]   I bet you you can't drift in your Porsche.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.520]   If I turn off the traction control, yes.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.440]   See, I can drift like a mother.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440]   I sometimes I drift.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440]   I don't even mean to.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.400]   So first it was like a rave got shut down at the La Porte House.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.600]   And then there's some drifting down the streets in Petaluma.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   And it's all the other.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   That's pretty fun.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.120]   The bad boy in Petaluma.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.760]   Let me tell you, I ain't my son.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   Now I want to talk about the edge.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.480]   Actually, this is the most technological car Ford has ever made.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.080]   Amazing vehicle.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.280]   Starts with just the exterior.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.600]   The lines are beautiful.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:27.440]   Stuff you could only really do with the latest computer generated designs.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.440]   It's aerodynamic.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.080]   Gives an incredible gas mileage.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:38.360]   You know, even though it's got that great 6 cylinder, 3.5 liter TIVCT engine, which is
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.120]   incredible, the V6.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.880]   185 horsepower and yet EPA estimated 27 highway miles per gallon.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.720]   Best in class second low leg row leg room, which is very, very spacious, incredible interior.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.160]   I really like the instrument panel.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.840]   Mine's actually a little bit of my Mustang.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.560]   Is this the one with the My Ford Touch?
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.120]   Yeah, the My Ford Touch is so amazing.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.640]   Behind the wheel, you've got two screens that are programmable.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.720]   You can have a tachometer or, you know, variety of things.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720]   And then you get the big on the stack.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.960]   You've got the eight inch screen.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.680]   It's basically Fort Sink.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.000]   I know you've heard us talk a lot about Fort Sink, but then it's the next generation with
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   lots more stuff.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.480]   You can get stitches on there, Pandora.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:22.480]   You know, basically the idea is whatever your phone is capable of, your car can do as
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480]   well.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.520]   You guys are probably iPhone guys, but you know on the Android phone, it'll read me
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.760]   my text messages when the text message comes in a robotic voice.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.400]   It's kind of funny.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   You have there.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   This is a Droid X.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.920]   And then Windows Phone 7 does it too.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.400]   I'm a big Droid X fan.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.680]   Now, did you know that I don't even know if it's in your copy notes for about that car?
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:44.840]   But I think most cars of the My Ford Touch that have that feature built in also have the
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.960]   ability that you can basically, I could tell my phone to connect and then it would, the
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.680]   car would take my phone's internet and create its own little access point.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.000]   So you'd connect your car to your passengers instead of tethering to my phone, they'd tether
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   it to the car.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   It's got Wi-Fi.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.040]   I would get the Wi-Fi from the phone.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.040]   It is cool.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.800]   Two USB ports and an SD card slot in the car.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.760]   I love anything that's got two USB ports and SD card slot in the car.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.480]   I like that.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.920]   They also have the Sport Package, 305 horsepower, 280 foot pounds of torque and that Sport Tune
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   suspension.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   I want you to take a look at an edge.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:22.280]   It's got the ambient lighting, the, the, the, uh, capitalist fuel system, which I really
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   like.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.240]   You know, you know, you know, it's just really easy.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.840]   All round, they've just designed a beautiful vehicle.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.120]   It's the Ford Edge.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.720]   You take a look, drive one at a Ford dealer near you and do try the My Ford Touch.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.680]   Or the Ford sink in any of the Ford vehicles.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.680]   They're really remarkable.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.440]   The hands-free calling, the complete control of the audio, the climate system, all with
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.680]   the voice, all without taking your hands off the wheeler, your eyes off the road.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.640]   Uh, they also, the 911 assist for safety is just a great vehicle.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.080]   Drive one at this week at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.560]   I really hope this is how American cars get back on track.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   Like the fact that it is.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   I think it is.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.560]   I think it is.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560]   I have the techiest, hard-for-farts.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.320]   I mean, Ford never, ever, ever even declared bankruptcy and they're doing my own.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   They took no money.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.280]   And then even GM, they're back on track.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   We own GM.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.120]   That's the funniest thing.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.840]   But I think the government is actually liquidating.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.840]   They're going to get their money back.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.080]   I think, yeah, and they're going to get out of there.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.000]   So, yeah, it all went according to plans.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.400]   No, I think all the American, you know, I'm a Ford fan, but I think all the American
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.920]   car companies are showing some real resilience, which is important because that's really a
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   big backbone of the nation's economy.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.120]   I wonder if the whole problem that Toyota had helped.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   And I mean, it was not good.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Oh, you bet.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   But I mean.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   Oh, you bet.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:39.280]   You go into, after that acceleration problem, you go into Toyota dealer, there's nobody
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.620]   there.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.360]   Would you buy a Toyota after that?
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.120]   I mean, in a way, it's like, when something bad happens when it comes to be like that,
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.120]   almost the safest.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.360]   Like, flying on September 13, 2011, probably the safest time to fly a type of thing.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.960]   I don't think the day after they announced that there's a huge flaw in you might have.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   No, not the day after the same thing.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.760]   You're going to say like right now, I mean, right now on where they are right now.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   Maybe now.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.760]   I know.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   I know.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:02.760]   I know.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.960]   Because it's also like there's a lot of, you know, to manufacture an automobile.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.000]   There's an immense amount of engineering to go into that before you go to mass produce.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.400]   I think that it's been long enough for them to address things that we can't find out.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.400]   Yeah, figure out what the actual issue is.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   All right.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   I'm going to get your blood pressure up.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:23.000]   The Senate Senate panel has approved the domain name seizure bill, the bill known as
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.160]   Kawaka combating online infringement and counterfeit acts after a flurry of last minute lobbying
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.200]   from representatives of the motion picture association of America, the recording industry
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.200]   association of America, the usual bad guys, the Senate committee approved the measure by
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   a unanimous vote.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.920]   Even the newspaper association of America was in on this one, which they said the legislation
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:54.880]   was needed because online piracy quote undermines the investments newspapers make in journalism.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.000]   Labor unions say American workers have suffered significant harm during the theft of copyright
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.400]   and trademark goods.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.400]   There was an ad in a newspaper targeting Capitol Hill signed by groups, including Major League
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:13.480]   Baseball, the NFL, Nintendo, Viacom, the US Chamber of Commerce.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.560]   So, so, oh, you're going to love Kawaka.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.840]   If so, copyright or trademark infringing websites.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.720]   Sounds like a drug like a what?
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.680]   Like a cholesterol drug or something.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.200]   By the way, a group of law professors on the other side say that the laws unconstitutional
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.640]   under the First Amendment would set a dangerous precedent with potentially serious consequences
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:49.280]   for free expression and global internet freedom.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:54.680]   The government decides which websites are legitimate or not.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.440]   The government decides do we cut these sites off from the internet, a website in danger
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:07.760]   of having its domain seized or having US internet providers basically say, I don't know what
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.160]   that site is, take it out of the DNS.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.480]   If it is primarily designed and has no demonstrable commercially significant purpose or use other
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.240]   than offering or providing access to one of our third copies of copyrighted works.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.920]   In other words, if it's the Pirate Bay, it doesn't exist.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.880]   And the government decides it.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.240]   That'll, it'll never work.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.240]   Providing access.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:33.080]   People will get around, but they're talking about like with the spirit of this is.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.880]   You're talking about it.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.320]   I agree it shouldn't, it shouldn't exist in the first place.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.960]   But if it did exist, people tweet that out in the second Pirate Bay is now the Pirate
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.960]   Bay's.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   But isn't that like, right?
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   Right.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.680]   Well, that's a big First Amendment issue though.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.560]   They shouldn't have to get that far anyway, right?
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.080]   That's what the whole argument is.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.800]   I mean, you shouldn't be able to censor anything without having specific definitions of what
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.000]   speech you're censoring, right?
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   This is not surprising at all.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.200]   I mean, I think this is why net neutrality is so important and why it's so difficult to
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.760]   communicate that because once you start talking about net neutrality, kind of people's eyes
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.960]   start glazing over.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.080]   And what does it mean?
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.920]   But things like this starts happening really slowly and you don't even realize it because
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.560]   the language is so complex who I think, you know, talking about this to like my grandmother
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.120]   and my mother, it's, it's, you have to sit down for a couple of hours to kind of go through
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   it.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.200]   It's, it's such an important topic.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.560]   What really disappoints me is that a lot of the people on this committee, um, the Senate
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.480]   Judiciary Committee are people like Patrick Leahy, who was traditionally known and been
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.000]   very good about internet protections.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.560]   Our own Dianne Feinstein from California, or in Hatch from Utah represents a novel, Russ
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.800]   Feingold from Washington, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Arlen Specter, Chuck Schumer in New
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   York.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.000]   These are all senators who voted for this, by the way.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.200]   I just want you to remember when, I guess it's too late.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:03.040]   Al Franken voted to censor the internet.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.240]   I think they just understand this.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.080]   They're saying that they can't take down these sites, right?
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.960]   Because they're overseas or whatever it may be.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   So they block them.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.240]   So they want to block them so that we can't act.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.760]   Take them out of DNS, basically.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:20.600]   Yeah, that domain name, seizure bill, you know, that's nice.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   Unbelievable.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.160]   Have you, uh, take, I'm sure Kevin, because you get all the beta of all this stuff.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.360]   Have you played with Facebook's new message messaging system?
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   I have not.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   No.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.800]   I sent Mark an email saying, can I have an access early?
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:38.720]   And he said, the only way he could do it is just adding name to that list.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.040]   And then they'll automatically roll it out.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.800]   Unless you work at the company.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.800]   Huh?
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.640]   Only way I could do that is if you go through proper stuff.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.640]   Yeah, right.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.720]   I mean, you know, I mean, he told you that, which is great.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.920]   I just, I'm sure everyone he knows.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.160]   And he's got, you know, you're a good friend.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.160]   Is that Zadi?
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   Anybody?
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   Do you have it?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   Anybody have the new message?
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   No.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   I don't know if they're doing that.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   I think it's just internal thing right now.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   It's only internal.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.920]   It's an actual message now that people are getting to add Facebook and add it as your
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920]   homepage.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.520]   So that's interesting.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.400]   So what you should do, I guess right now is go to Facebook.com/username and get a username.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   Because I presume that would be-
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]   That's already have yours, right?
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   Right.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   I'm the Leo Laport.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.400]   Who has Leo Laport?
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.400]   I don't know.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.240]   Somebody who's not the Leo Laport.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.880]   David Prager, it says here.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.280]   So you should get your name.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.920]   Because presumably your address will be whatever that is at Facebook.com, right?
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920]   Right.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.000]   Gosh, I need to get a- I never got a new username.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.920]   I'm Facebook.com/KevinRose, but that's my fan page one.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   Well, that's okay.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.680]   And you have- but that's not going to be my email address.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.320]   The Leo Laport is my fan page.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   Oh.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320]   You don't have a personal one.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   Right.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320]   Well, I do.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   What is it?
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   I think it's Leo.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   I don't know.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.320]   I need to get another one.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   I keep coming up with new email addresses.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.120]   Well, first of all, no subject line.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.320]   I mean, it's messaging, not email.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320]   No subject line.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   No.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.520]   The whole thread, if Kevin and I have a chat, a Facebook message, and then an email message
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.520]   is all the same.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520]   I like the idea.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520]   You like it.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520]   I do like it.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520]   Why?
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.560]   I think it's cool because it's a unifying, all these little things that have always been
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.080]   like me having to be like, "Ah, that was a conversation I had here and it's not actually
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   my inbox."
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.720]   And if they pull it off, forget that it's Facebook for a second.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.000]   Let's just say that this is the way that things are going and then maybe it's Gmail
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   that launches something very similar or six months ago.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.560]   Well, I think priority inbox is a little bit like that, right?
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.560]   Well, no, no.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   It's algorithmic.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.360]   But it doesn't follow me around, right?
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.520]   Like I like the idea that I have my phone on me and I want to have like if Prager says
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.800]   something to me on chat and I'm away from my computer, yes, I can have my emails signed
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   in here.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   But now it's in there.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   Now it's in there.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Now it's here, it's saved.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800]   I respond back and that's still an email that I can search later.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.600]   It's like, I know Google kind of does this with GTOC kind of because you can save your
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600]   history and search it.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600]   In fact, I have Google Voice.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   In fact, I have Google Voice.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.400]   If you can search your Gmail, you can find previous chats through people with real chat
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   clients.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.440]   I'm just worried that it's going to make it that much harder to try and focus.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.920]   Because that's crap.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.520]   Here's the thing.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.240]   The one thing that Facebook is pretty good at and that Mark is pretty good at is making
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.760]   things fairly usable and simple.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.680]   Their IAM client is simple to use.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.240]   If they can pull it off and it's not like I have to think like did I sign into GTOC and
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.000]   did I, if they can pull it off, it'll be pretty awesome.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   I don't know.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.680]   I love it following me around wherever I go.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.600]   Do you think there's something scary?
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.160]   Do you think there's something scary in that and having all your eggs in one basket?
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.000]   My eggs are already in the Gmail basket.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.200]   So if like Google owns my life right now.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   Yeah, me too.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.000]   You know, it's like, I don't know.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.080]   I don't know either.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.640]   I mean, I kind of, I was talking to my sister about this and it's so much easier for me to
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.000]   communicate with her on Facebook.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.120]   She doesn't use email at all.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.800]   So in one way, I think it's great.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   But I don't know.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.400]   I don't know how I feel about it yet until I actually use it.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.520]   Yeah, I was just thinking the other day, like if I had Rick right now, I have AIM and I
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.520]   have Gmail.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.520]   You use AIM really?
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520]   I use AIM still, yeah.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.520]   I use AIM.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]   You use a client.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   I use a client that looks at AIM.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.000]   Most of my friends that I chat with and I am are through their AIM account through their
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   AIM chat account.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   Right.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   So but here's the thing though.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.760]   If I had something where someone was trying to Skype with me, say someone's trying to Skype
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   video with me.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.480]   Not at my computer, but I'm on my iPhone, but it ports it to FaceTime for me so I can have
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.200]   a video conversation or if I'm not on that, then it opens up a chat with that person.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.920]   Like, that's kind of cool because it's like, you know, it figures out what device I'm on
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.920]   and then translates it to the appropriate.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.400]   It's part of the Facebook messaging to be a conduit, meaning like, so you still have
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.440]   your Gmail, you just get it through your Facebook thing.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   Not.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.400]   Do they want you to start using Kevin Rose at Facebook.com?
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.520]   No, they're saying that like if the person isn't on Facebook and they send you an email
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.520]   to Facebook, it turns into this type of conversation, right?
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.000]   It doesn't look like an email.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.480]   It's just a conversation you're having with someone, right?
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.440]   And if you happen to be on your phone, it appears on your phone.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.600]   If you happen to be online and it appears in your browser and, you know, it kind of
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   follows you around.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600]   I don't know.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.240]   Isn't the problem that we just, there's emails broken because there's, it's just too
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.240]   much.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   It's too much.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240]   It's out of control.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240]   That's, that's the main thing.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.960]   That's the main thing for me is that I go to my Gmail and I have, you know, a couple thousand
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.960]   unread Gmail messages.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   Yeah, me too.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.680]   This will follow me around to where I can deal with it right away.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.240]   Then I won't have that problem.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   You need a blank.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   You need a blank.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.280]   No, you don't, you think that problem will just push on your eyes.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.920]   Well, if I deal with it right away, then your phone now, maybe I just need to like,
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.920]   just connect.
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.480]   You can, you can, you can choose when you want to, when you want to be interrupted by things.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.120]   Cause I, I do think that there's something to be said for, you know, focusing on the tasks
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.920]   that you're doing and then deciding whether or not, okay, I'm going to deal with the message
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920]   that I'm getting.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.120]   You can walk in around, you don't mind, you can turn that on.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   And then, um, the other thing is that one of the things that Mark Zuckerberg said was
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.280]   that email is too formal, but in a way it's become so damn informal.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.800]   And you, that's part of the reason you're getting inundated with too much stuff.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.280]   And like, there's this, this is an email.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.960]   It's just makes it easier, doesn't it?
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:01.560]   I mean, I guess he wants to make it faster to deal with it because you have to open the
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.080]   email sometimes depending on how you have it set up.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.080]   Mark's interesting.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.440]   He deleted our archive and respond to it or whatever.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.120]   I have to say, I think the social network is the best thing that ever happened to it.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.160]   Because he's now much more face forward than he used to be.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.440]   He's leading these events.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   They're doing a lot of events.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.800]   They're being very aggressive, doing a lot of stuff.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.000]   And I think he's kind of stepped up and he's quite impressive.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.960]   He seems like he's very, very smart and really thinking about this stuff in new and unique
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   ways.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.440]   What's scary though is Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, right?
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.440]   It's him.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.800]   All the ideas are his and he's got half a billion users.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.240]   That's a lot of power for one guy.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.560]   He said, "Yeah, Facebook's blue because I'm kind of colorblind and what's the color I can
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560]   see?"
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.320]   This guy has a lot of power.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320]   What do you think?
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.360]   Obviously, you respect him.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.640]   I mean, I think he's a brilliant guy.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.880]   Is he listening to people like Brett Taylor, the new CTO?
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.960]   I don't know about his.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.640]   Oh, Brett, I know Brett pretty well.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   Brett's pretty cool.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   Yeah, Brett's really cool.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   He came from Friend Feed.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.200]   In fact, you see a lot of Friend Feed in this messaging system.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.200]   You see a lot of Friend Feed.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200]   I mean, they've developed likes.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.560]   Like that translated over.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.800]   I think that he likes to debate things out and he likes to think big picture.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.760]   I think he's just really good at looking at this and saying, "Okay, six months from now,
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.560]   I think this is where things are going and doing them slightly differently."
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.560]   We are.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.480]   He goes to the power of the graph.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.240]   We are in a very interesting time.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:32.280]   The angel discussion we had a minute ago, I can't think of another time where there's
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.440]   been this kind of creative foment and then people like you and a lot of people like you
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.600]   with a little bit of money and a lot of advice to help fund this.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.360]   And then there are people like Mark Zuckerberg who can just, I mean, I cannot think back to
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   it.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.360]   It wasn't Bill Gates.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:52.560]   I can't think another time where one person's ideas had expression to half a billion people
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   in this way.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.720]   I think that's unique.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.720]   It's unique.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.400]   I don't think you can, you know, Edward R. Murrow, the early days of mass media, I don't think
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.280]   anything is like this.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.800]   This takes mass media to the next level.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   And it's not just national.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.200]   It's global.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:12.480]   So it's, you know, Mark Zuckerberg's impact is not just inside the US as CBS or ABC was.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.480]   It's everywhere.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.480]   It's all over the world.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.280]   Does it scare you, Zadi, that there's that much power in one person?
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:22.640]   I mean, I think Mark is genius and I love just hearing the news that's coming out of him.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.600]   But I think it is interesting how he takes a 360 approach to it so that now, you know,
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.560]   when you open your browser, your homepage will be Facebook, now your emails forget about
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.400]   them, they'll all be integrated into Facebook.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:40.360]   And so it seems like we're returning to AOL 1995 where we're going back into these small
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.960]   villages that are kind of, you know, in and out of themselves, you know, their own thing
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.240]   is outside of the internet.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.800]   So I don't know how I feel about it.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.240]   I'm a little conflicted about just living within the Facebook world and that being everything
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.960]   and kind of that being my entryway to the web.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.560]   I'm still waiting to see how it pans out.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.880]   There's something uncomfortable about it.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:07.680]   It makes me uncomfortable that there's so much power in one person.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:13.200]   On the other hand, I celebrate the fact that it just as Larry Lessig said in his review
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.840]   of the social network in the new republic, he said, it's I celebrate the fact that a
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.120]   guy didn't ask to ask permission.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120]   He just did it.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.360]   He didn't have to ask Harvard.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.680]   He didn't have to ask anybody.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.800]   You know, he just said, I got it.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.720]   And because I guess he's a genius and was able to kind of tap into this raw nerve instance
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.080]   success, I mean, retrually instant success.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.040]   Here's another way that we live in a brave new world.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040]   Look at this.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.720]   This is a Kickstarter.com as a website where you can go.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.120]   If you want to raise money for an idea, you don't have to go to a venture capital.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.440]   You don't have to go to an angel investor.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.880]   You go to Kickstarter.com and say, well, that's what the diaspora people did at the beginning
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   of the year.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   And I'm very interested in the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:02.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:08.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   of the use of the use of the

[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:30.880]   of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use

[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:48.880]   So have you seen this Israeli video about the peacetalks between the birds and the pigs?
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:53:01.880]   Dear friends, after too many years and too many victims, I believe we have reached an agreement that will put an end to the senseless conflict between you.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.880]   The UN, or the Yanki, the defense of the pigs from any aerial attack.
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   Why the birds? We get most of their eggs back.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:26.880]   You gotta read the subtitles. It's time to end this struggle which has cost millions of innocent people their ability to concentrate in work.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:30.880]   Enough with that already. Show some respect.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.880]   What did I do? What did I do? Stop eating like a pig.
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.880]   What? What was that?
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:40.880]   Say what? Say what?
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:48.880]   Alright, you get the idea.
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:53.880]   But this wasn't so good. It's so good.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:57.880]   You can kind of start to understand the birds. That's what's scary.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.880]   I wish my father were here to witness this moment.
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.880]   You can see the dudes inside of the pigs.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:11.880]   So they end up fighting. He brings out the Angry Birds music all as well. It's pretty funny.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:18.880]   Erez Nehederette, Israeli for Wonderful Country, a popular live sketch comedy show in Israel.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:24.880]   So obviously it's not just the US. Israel's also having an Angry Birds epidemic.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.880]   Now I read an article in a Gizmodo saying, "Oh Angry Birds, look at this.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:33.880]   This is evidence of fragmentation in the Android market. Look at all the Android phones it doesn't run on.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.880]   It doesn't run on the old phones. It only runs on the new phones. Big deal.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:41.880]   It runs very by the way. Samsung Galaxy Tab. I should have brought it.
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.880]   Very good Angry Birds platform. A little smaller than the iPad.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.880]   Seven inches.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:47.880]   Interesting.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:48.880]   But it's Android.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:49.880]   It's Android.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.880]   That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something smaller than...
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.880]   I should have brought it. I can show it's great.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.880]   I want an Android device. It's not going to be on my phone.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.880]   I don't want that like seven inches.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.880]   Well, I like the Droid, but I think you would like the seven inch tablets. I really do.
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:04.880]   You can hack the iPhone and install Android OS on it.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.880]   So, manheim Germany.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.880]   It'll boot.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:08.880]   It'll boot your iPhone.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:09.880]   That would be a good thing.
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:11.880]   Zadi knows where I'm going with this. Doesn't she?
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:14.880]   Zadi already knows what I'm talking about.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:22.880]   Google Street View. Nobody can explain this picture from Google Street View, but it seems to be a naked man climbing out of his trunk.
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.880]   Is that like a dog lying on the ground?
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.880]   And there's a dog lying on the ground.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.880]   For no reason.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:29.880]   For no reason.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.880]   Maybe he's climbing in, climbing out. We don't know. His clothes are on the ground.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:34.880]   It seems to...
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.880]   What is that next to the car? What is that?
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.880]   Orange juice gasoline. I don't know.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:41.880]   A broken umbrella is apparently there.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.880]   I think there's people that see a Google Street View car.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.880]   I think I have a slide.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:46.880]   Maybe blocks.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.880]   Wait, many blocks.
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.880]   Dude, go home and do like this.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:49.880]   I do.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:50.880]   I've done anything more.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.880]   The smartest you've done that before?
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.880]   No, when I was on the freeway, I was following one.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.880]   And I was just flipping them off and stuff in case they like ever put it on Street View.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:55:59.880]   Because then I can go and see myself.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:00.880]   You just tell us.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:03.880]   Because Patrick Norton got caught by Street View on Street View.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:04.880]   Did he?
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:05.880]   Oh yeah.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.880]   Years ago.
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:07.880]   Years ago going into...
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:08.880]   I think it was still pixelated. You could barely...
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.880]   D.L.T.V. what years ago.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.880]   That's funny.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.880]   I think here's my...
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:15.880]   Here's what Google listened to me. I know what I'm talking about.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:17.880]   They should put out ahead of time a schedule.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.880]   You'd have much more interesting Street View.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:20.880]   For sure.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.880]   You just say, "Hey, we're coming to your town. We'll be there at three o'clock."
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.880]   Have fun. Knock yourself out.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.880]   Oh yeah.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:26.880]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.880]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.880]   It'd be fun to like go in a place and be able to jump back through time.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:31.880]   Like have like a timeline.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:32.880]   Right.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.880]   And so you could be like, "Okay, show me this street when Marty Groz going on in this year or something like that."
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.880]   That could be interesting.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:38.880]   Oh, I'm sure.
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.880]   I mean, all of it's archived in the same way.
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:44.880]   I mean, there's going to be a Google Street View like what's the site that shows the way back machine.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.880]   But for Google Street View.
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:46.880]   In the future you'll be able to do that.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:47.880]   Yeah, but for sure.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:48.880]   I'll be there.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:49.880]   I'm not going to be interested.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:50.880]   You're really cool.
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:52.880]   Cool.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.880]   One last story that we're going to get going.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.880]   Reid Hastings, CEO of Netflix, points out that nobody is watching the movies on the iPad,
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.320]   the iPhone, the portable devices.
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:08.200]   He says there isn't any appetite on small devices for long form video.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.200]   He's got the data to back that up.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:12.120]   And he's got the long form content like movies.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.760]   I bet you there's some people watching on iPads.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:17.360]   Well, if you're at home, don't watch on your iPad.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:18.360]   He knows.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:19.360]   See, that's a cool streaming.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:22.400]   People who watch movies on the iPad, I think, but maybe not through Netflix because you might
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:23.400]   be on a plane somewhere.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:27.560]   You might be traveling somewhere where you're not able to stream the movie to your iPad.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.040]   And maybe that's why that was pretty people's stream.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.480]   You're concerned about battery life also, right?
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.960]   He says if you're at home, then don't stream on your iPad.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:37.280]   Stream on something better in terms of the display.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.280]   Oh, for sure.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:42.640]   The only thing I stream on a regular basis are NFL games to my iPhone when I'm at the
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:46.400]   gym because that way I can watch direct TV, boom, watch an Intel game because they have
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:47.400]   wireless in my gym.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.000]   Well, what he's saying, which is kind of interesting, by putting Netflix on the Xbox
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.640]   PS3 and Mac, that increased its subscriber base.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:57.040]   They got more Netflix users.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:02.960]   But he said coming to the iPhone and iPad had negligible impact on the business at all.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   At all.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.960]   I wonder if that'll change.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:08.760]   I kind of find myself watching movies right before I'm going to bed.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:12.960]   I will turn on Netflix or Hulu on my iPhone and watch a little bit of it.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:16.240]   So I don't know if that'll change once the battery life does get better.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.240]   It's kind of sad.
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:23.600]   I just see Zati curled up pillow, little tiny iPhone just watching a little sad little
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:24.600]   movie.
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:25.600]   It's quite sad.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.600]   I'm chilling.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:30.520]   All alone a tear falling from her eye.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.320]   At least I have this little iPhone.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:35.680]   Keeps me warm.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.760]   You can follow Zati on Twitter @zadei.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:44.760]   And of course, epicfood.com is her web video.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:45.760]   So good to have you on.
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:49.120]   Finally, I really apologize for not getting you on sooner.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:53.240]   I apologize for time Warner Cable, but thank you.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:54.240]   No need.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.240]   No need.
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.240]   We'll have you back.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.240]   And next time just come up to the cottage, then we won't have to worry about you freezing
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.240]   and dying.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:00.240]   I would love that.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.240]   Thank you a lot.
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.720]   Keep the lid on.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.880]   Kevin Rose, of course, is at Dignation, dig.com.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.200]   You're doing that great show with Tim Ferriss.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.200]   I like that.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:13.400]   You got a new show coming out, right?
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:14.400]   I do.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.640]   Want to debut that here?
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:23.240]   It's basically what I really want to do is I get to meet all these really cool entrepreneurs.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:28.160]   And I would like to sit down with them over T and just talk about the creative side of
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.160]   what they're building.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:33.120]   Because they go on air and they talk about where will Twitter be five years from now
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.120]   or whatever it may be.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:37.720]   But I want to get into how they actually come up with the ideas for leaders and things like
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.720]   that.
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:39.720]   You can call it this weekend start-ups.
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:40.720]   I understand that's available.
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.720]   Is it available?
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.520]   Do you stop doing the show?
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:45.720]   Yeah, sure he did.
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:47.960]   No, he did not.
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:51.400]   I don't think you can copyright that.
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:53.320]   Jason's show I've watched it.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:56.160]   It's quite a bit different than what I want to get to.
[01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:58.840]   I love the idea of getting into it and finding out.
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.560]   I would watch that like crazy.
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:01.560]   I would love.
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:03.480]   To me the processes was very interesting.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:06.680]   These are the smartest people in our culture and our society right now.
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.280]   They're doing very interesting things.
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:09.280]   It should be fun.
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:10.280]   I'd love to do that.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.280]   Will that be at KevinRose.com?
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:15.200]   Yeah, I'm basically going to put up the videos on my site.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:20.440]   I was going to call the show forward but I've come up with a different name.
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:21.440]   Oh, good.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.160]   When do you think the first one?
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.760]   I'm hoping January 1st.
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.880]   Okay, beginning of the year.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.880]   We will look for that.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:30.920]   He's also Kevin Rose on Twitter.
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:34.120]   David Prager is the heart and soul of revision 3.
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:37.960]   There would be no revision 3 if there were not a DL Prager.
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:38.960]   Thank you.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.280]   Anything you want to talk about?
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:42.520]   Got anything exciting coming up?
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.800]   Any employees I can poach?
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:44.800]   Yeah, right.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.760]   No, things are going to have a really great time where we've been scaling our ad sales
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.760]   team really well and being able to--
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:52.760]   You've got the best guy in the business, Brett Murphy.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:56.200]   People in the chat room were talking about HD Nation going away and they're all upset
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200]   about that.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.200]   No, it's not.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200]   It's part of Tekzilla.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.600]   Basically, it's the full content of that but we're going to double the output of Tekzilla
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:03.920]   and within that we need to do it.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.920]   That's the way to do it.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:05.920]   Yeah, because I've always been excited about it.
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.280]   I love Robert and I love Patrick and I think them together, it's a great show.
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:11.400]   That's the way it ought to be.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.280]   Thank you, David.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.400]   Thank you, chat room for not being too mean.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.800]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:24.040]   We are doing a best of Twitch for the week after Christmas so if you go to twit.tv/bestof

[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.640]   As I mentioned, Gary Vaynerchuk is on for our one hour special interview, our Twit Talks

[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.080]   Tom Merritt and I will get to talk to him.
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:50.320]   Our Tron Special, Sarah Lane Tron Special, she went down to the Special Effects, what's
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:52.920]   the name of the Special Effects Place that she went to?
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:58.320]   As a PDI, I can't remember anyway, is debuting this Tuesday.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:05.160]   Just in time for your Thanksgiving at youtube.com/twit unless they pull it for a decent exposure.
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.360]   I thank you all for being here.
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:07.360]   We'll see you next time.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:08.840]   Another Twit is in the game.
