[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.400]   Who's gonna be the winner?

[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.280]   and why they call it red velvet cake.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.200]   It's all coming up next.

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   Are you in your toy, your playroom, Ashley?
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.600]   - This is my office, yes.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.440]   - Same thing.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.880]   - It's the same, it's the same.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.080]   Yeah, my adult playroom.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.840]   This is, I've been building it.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.320]   I wish I could show you guys.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.840]   Maybe next time I have a,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.960]   I've been building out a vlog set right next to this.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.880]   I wanna have like a little streaming space
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.840]   with my computer and then I have a set
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.080]   with a cool chair and everything.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   I just finished it, I'm very excited about it,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   and you might get to see it on CNET at some point soon.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   - Well, we used to call a flashcam set in broadcasting.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.920]   - Indeed.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.440]   - And actually these days you could be on CNN,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   you could be on any network in the world, if you have,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.560]   oh, I have a flashcam set in my house with Skype.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.040]   You're in, you're on.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.800]   That's Paul Therat.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.080]   I recognize those centurion tones of the rot.com.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.640]   - Authoritatively agreeing with whatever it is you just said.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.720]   - Yes indeed, Leo, you're right.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.440]   - It's good to see you on the Wednesday show.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.280]   Actually Paul and I have spent a long time together
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200]   'cause Thursday morning we cover--
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.920]   - Why are you starting to ask about that actually?
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.400]   (laughing)
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.600]   - That weird ex, we actually, we started by that,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   but let me first introduce Harry McCracken,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.720]   the technologizer from Fast Company.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.360]   It's good to see you Harry.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.080]   - Good to be here, Leo and everybody.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.640]   - Harry just did a great piece.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.360]   - So we'll ask about on the Advanced Technology Center
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.920]   at Google, the ATAP.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.440]   It was really interesting all the things they're working on.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.040]   And then I missed this in Fast Company on June 30th,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.480]   you celebrated the 50th anniversary of the picture phone,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.280]   the first Zoom call.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.080]   (laughing)
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   - Oh yeah.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.480]   Yeah, actually the first--
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.240]   - It was the AT&T picture phone, right?
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.960]   - It was like the first one where it was actually a service
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.240]   that people paid for to use for work.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.680]   The first actual video call was in 1964
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.960]   at Old Spare in Disneyland.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.800]   - At Old Spare, I saw it.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.960]   - But in 1970 in Pittsburgh,
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.560]   you could get the equipment and use it at your office.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.320]   - Yeah, the New York World Spare in 1964.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.600]   I remember going as a kid, I was about seven or eight years old
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.720]   and I remember seeing a picture phone thinking,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   someday daddy will all be--
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.200]   (laughing)
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   And it only took the germ to do it.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.680]   (laughing)
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   - 56 years.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.720]   - 56 years and COVID-19.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.040]   - And one pandemic.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.960]   - Yeah, one pandemic later.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.800]   We're all doing this.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.640]   - In 1964, there were three places in the country
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   where you could do it.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.400]   New York, Chicago, and I think maybe Washington, DC.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.640]   And it was, it cost a lot of money in 1964 dollars
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.400]   to make a three minute call.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   So basically it did not catch up on,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.240]   it also didn't catch on in 1970.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.520]   The only gets sold a few hundred.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.440]   - Yeah, wonder why.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.920]   I thought actually until very recently,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.440]   it would never catch on
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.840]   because people just didn't want to prepare themselves
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.760]   to appear on a camera.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.640]   - But we're used to it now, right?
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.360]   Ashley, you've got your own little set
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.640]   on your in your house.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.480]   You're ready to go.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.560]   And I was like, and you know, I work on a video team
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.360]   so everybody wants to see each other,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.120]   everybody wants to talk and stuff.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.760]   So, and especially now when we're not actually getting out
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.080]   and seeing a lot of people,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.400]   it's like, it's a really nice way
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   to sort of just connect with other human beings.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.040]   So yeah, yeah, I mean,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.240]   yeah, more ties it out now.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.560]   That video calling is a lot cheaper.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.520]   (chuckles)
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.520]   - Well, and to be fair,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.040]   I remember in 1970,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.560]   any long distance call was expensive.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.320]   If you remember that, Paul,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.480]   if you had a long distance call,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.080]   you'd say, I'm calling long distance.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.280]   Wait, it's got to make this quick.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.560]   - Call you one Sunday.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.720]   - Yeah, right.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.320]   - Mom, I'll call you on Sunday for two minutes
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.600]   'cause that's all I can afford.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   And now we call around the world for nothing.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.840]   I mean, it is literally nothing, right?
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.280]   Kind of hard to believe.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.120]   - Chief?
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.960]   - Yeah.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   - I made a $75 phone call the other day.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   - Where did you call it?
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.200]   - I don't, it is.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.040]   - Where could you?
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.880]   What'd you call the moon?
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.680]   - I called India and the person I was calling asked
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.760]   for it to be an actual phone call
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.120]   rather than Skype or whatever.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.200]   And I believe it passed me 75 bucks for like half an hour.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.640]   - Why would you do that?
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.760]   - Because I can expense it.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600]   - Oh, okay.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.800]   So fast company paid for it.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.840]   (laughing)
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.920]   - It seems odd that they wanted a phone call.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.480]   Was this like deep throat you were talking to?
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.320]   - Not particularly.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.920]   The nice thing about phone calls is they're,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.360]   if you're on an iPad, like I am,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.440]   if you use your phone, it's easier to record a voice call.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.280]   - Right.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.080]   - Stuff like Skype or Zoom or whatever.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.800]   So I don't object to it personally.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   Also it's pretty reliable, which is important
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.720]   if you're recording an interview for a story.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.080]   - Okay, I get it.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   I make sense.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.040]   So Paul and I watched,
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   did you, I'm sure Ashley,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.280]   'cause you cover gaming,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.960]   you watched the Xbox event on Thursday morning.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.560]   - We even had a live stream about that.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.400]   - I thought you might have.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.240]   - I was seeing that.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.080]   It was very fun.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.920]   - We did too.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.040]   It was just Paul and me, so it wasn't fun.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   But, yes.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   (laughing)
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.880]   - We tolerate it.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.040]   - Guess that all that time together,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   of course you're having a good time.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.800]   - Mostly we were saying things like,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.640]   is that Tetris?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.480]   That looks like Tetris.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.360]   Are they saying they've got a Tetris game?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   Is that possible?
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.200]   - And then there was.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.600]   - You have one hour to show games.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.520]   Can you get a show Tetris?
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.360]   - Tetris?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.040]   - Yep.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.200]   - And then there was.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.480]   There was an actual Tetris game.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.680]   - There was an actual Tetris game.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.480]   And then the other thing that Paul,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.920]   I was very impressed,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.760]   they had Tinkerbell, right?
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.600]   And Paul's going, "Oh yeah."
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.640]   - Well, it was gonna be the last game.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.200]   And I'm floating around with Tinkerbell.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   I see you could be kidding me.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.040]   You gotta be kidding me.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.000]   The only thing that could save this
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.400]   is she gets eaten by a frog.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   - And she did!
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.240]   (laughing)
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.600]   - He called it.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.440]   And I was like, "Oh thank you."
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.280]   - That's a man.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.120]   That's clippable.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.520]   You put that on the internet.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.680]   Put it on TikTok.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.120]   - Get that up on TikTok.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.960]   - Impressive.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.040]   There's your TikTok start 'em right there in a box.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.760]   Listen to her, she knows.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.720]   She's with the socials.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.120]   So the big thing I thought,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.040]   and at the time I remarked it,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.880]   but I didn't really think about it,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.720]   is how almost, I think they said it for every game.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.360]   Every single game was on Xbox Game Pass.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.200]   Is that right, Paul?
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.040]   I think it was.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.880]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.720]   - Yep.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   - That's a big deal.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.400]   - And that's, yeah.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.200]   And this is the difference
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.560]   in the ways that these companies
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.720]   are gonna market for the next gen.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.360]   I mean, Sony is selling you a console,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.080]   and Microsoft will sell you a console,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.000]   but what really Microsoft wants is a subscription service.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.320]   And you can choose your device,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.440]   through XCloud or through Game Pass.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   - They only said, referred to,
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.640]   they didn't even ever say XCloud,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   but they only referred to gaming the cloud.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.240]   - I thought that was interesting,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.280]   but XCloud is a code name.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.640]   So that suggests that that name is not permanent.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.200]   - I mean, if you do the math,
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.560]   it makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.080]   So you can either pay,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.480]   so Sony is hoping that you'll pay,
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.400]   let's say, four to $500 for their next gen console,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.360]   and then $60 for a handful of triple A games.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.440]   - Or 70, in some cases, yeah.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.840]   - Yeah, or 70, in some cases.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.320]   And then you'll buy into PlayStation Plus, right?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.880]   And so Microsoft is like, well, cool, but what if?
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.920]   - Yeah.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.240]   - What if, if you can't afford a Series X,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.720]   or it's something not interesting to you,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.440]   maybe you have a PC,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.160]   a lot of those games are cross-platform, right?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.520]   So they're being very smart about it as a service
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.720]   and saying, well, if you don't wanna upgrade,
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.040]   like, that's okay, we got you.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.240]   You can play all of these great games on Game Pass,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.400]   it'll only cost you X amount of dollars a month.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.920]   And over time, if you consider that,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.600]   over the life cycle of a console,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.520]   you're looking at a thousand dollars spend, maybe more,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.840]   but it's like a consistent-- - No one's thinking
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.280]   like that, don't talk like that,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.640]   no one's sending a thousand dollars.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.160]   (both laughing)
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.920]   - But if you enjoy games here--
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.040]   - Yeah, you're just enjoying games.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.800]   It's if you spend $15 a month for five years, you know?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.400]   That's a lot of money.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.880]   And like, it's way more than just-- - Sorry,
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.120]   as you were talking, you reminded me of,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.920]   or you put the idea in my head that in many ways,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.200]   what Microsoft is doing is the same thing they've done
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.440]   on Windows with PCs, which is just preserving
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.120]   backward compatibility.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.240]   You know, Apple, or Sony is moving ahead
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   very aggressively like Apple does,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.680]   getting rid of all technology.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.920]   And Microsoft is over here saying, hold on a second.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.840]   It's all gonna work fine. - But you can use your most too.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.560]   - Yep, you can go-- - Yeah, like when you want
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.880]   and when you do-- - We just want you
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.120]   in the ecosystem, which is one to the ecosystem.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.120]   And if you want to subscribe-- - Super Microsoft.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.600]   - That's great.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.140]   - And also it sort of makes sense as part of
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.400]   Satya Nadella's vision of Microsoft
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.680]   in terms of it being so service oriented
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.160]   about multiple platforms.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.720]   And you can use the platform of your choice
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.240]   in a lot of cases.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.280]   - Yep. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.800]   You can play this Xbox game on whatever you want.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.760]   You want to play it on PC, we gotcha.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.800]   You want to play it on Xbox one, we got you.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.640]   We want to play it on Series X, great.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   Like, here it is, it's on Game Pass.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.440]   And also, I gotta say like kudos to Microsoft
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.520]   for making Game Pass extremely compelling
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   with all of these day and date titles.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.840]   I mean, Halo Infinite is a game that Microsoft
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.360]   could very easily say, no, that's not gonna be
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.760]   on Game Pass for a little while.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.520]   Like, we're gonna wait.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.120]   But no, they just came out swinging and like,
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.080]   yeah, you're gonna be able to play this on Game Pass.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.720]   Like, no problem, we got you.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.400]   - The trick here is gonna be the third parties
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.520]   because, you know, the selection of games
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.040]   that are on X-Cloud in particular,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.200]   that those are the game, whatever they call it,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.800]   those are the games that will play anywhere,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   you know, on a mobile device or whatever,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.360]   that's gonna be up to the developers.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.800]   And I'm curious to see, obviously Microsoft's, you know,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.680]   their studio games will be in there,
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.920]   but I wonder about the third parties.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.360]   - Can you get a CD Projekt Red to put a cyberpunk
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.680]   on that service?
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.440]   - Well, could I get Call of Duty in there, right?
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.000]   And I think we know the answer to that one is no, but.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.080]   - Why is it no?
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.840]   - I think Call of Duty does pretty well financially
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.040]   in the unplug current part.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.000]   - There's no technical reason though, right?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.960]   They could.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.200]   - Yeah, I mean, their feeling is like,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.440]   if you wanna play it on a, oh, sorry.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.960]   But yeah, if you wanna play it on PC and Xbox
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.880]   or whatever, a PC and PlayStation, please do.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.920]   But then you'll have to pay for it twice.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.360]   - It is a measure of the difference in business models
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.960]   between place Sony and Microsoft.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.800]   Sony is a hardware company.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.480]   Microsoft is increasingly not even a Windows company.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.120]   It's a cloud company.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.960]   - A service company.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.860]   - Yeah.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.000]   So it makes perfect sense for Microsoft to say,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.960]   you know, the truth is we don't care where you play it.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.280]   And I think the reason they, I mean, obviously,
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.800]   they can't impose this on third parties,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.240]   but they did demonstrate some AAA title.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.960]   I mean, that Halo Infinite is AAA high quality,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.320]   4K 60 frames per second.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   And if they can stream that from the cloud,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.840]   then there's no reason any game
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   couldn't be streamed from the cloud, right?
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.440]   - Right.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   I think that's the future of video games, right?
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.080]   Where it's, you know, we're now seeing an infrastructure
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.160]   emerge that, you know, hopefully for most people
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.000]   enables them.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.120]   I mean, I know that there are a lot of communities still
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.800]   that are underserved in the way of high speed internet.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.560]   So that becomes a problem, right?
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.520]   And one of the things that actually kept the Xbox one
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.560]   from having that feature on it
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   that did those online checks was the military.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.400]   - Submarines.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.560]   - Militaries was very upset because, you know,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.200]   a lot of times you don't have access.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.040]   - They took a lot of heat.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.880]   - I mean, I'll just play your video.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.040]   - They're saying you can't do it in a submarine.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   They took almost someone who literally said,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.040]   what do you say to someone who's on a submarine?
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.480]   And they said, well, maybe you should stick
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.680]   with the Xbox 360.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.520]   - Yeah.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.360]   - Did you?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.400]   - I think that got fired, didn't you?
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.240]   - That's right, he's gone.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.080]   - He's gone.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.920]   - Yeah.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.760]   - He doesn't work there anymore.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.600]   It's not a good strategy.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.880]   And the thing is, so the infrastructure's not there yet,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.040]   I think to make the full leap, but it is not a wild idea,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.200]   especially now that we're seeing consoles go
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.120]   without optical drives.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.960]   You know, the next step of that is now we have this really,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.800]   really inexpensive box that doesn't even store anything.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.320]   It just plays our games off our servers
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.560]   for a subscription fee, you know, in the future.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.880]   And you just, you buy a controller
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.360]   and you connect it to that thing.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.760]   And that's, you know, there you go.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.400]   - That's kind of interesting because
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:08.120]   it makes to Sony, Sony PlayStation 5
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.920]   is for people who have done submarines
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.160]   and for anybody else.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.000]   There's X5.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   - That's literally the marketing tag line.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.440]   - It is.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.800]   - This is for people in submarines.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.880]   - But in a way, that's where Paul and Mary Jo
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.440]   and I on Windows Weekly have had a constant conversation
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.320]   about the future of computing being in the cloud.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.360]   That, you know, boy, there was a great piece
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.920]   in Bloomberg Business this week,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.680]   about the Norse,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:41.720]   the big Norse aluminum companies, ransomware attack.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.360]   And it was just devastating.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.720]   Actually, it's well worth reading
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   if you haven't read it, Norse Kydro lost $60 million.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   They had cyber insurance,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.480]   but it only paid about $3 million of the 60 million in costs.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.800]   They were prepared in every way a company
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.360]   could be prepared for ransomware,
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.640]   but they're so distributed
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.880]   and they have so many processes on computers
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.960]   that it just devastated them for weeks.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.400]   They were down, they couldn't make products,
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.120]   they couldn't ship products, they couldn't service customers.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.440]   They couldn't even easily pay their own employees.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.200]   They payroll system was down.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   They had to pay their employees in Brazil
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.320]   by copying the previous payroll
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.920]   and manually eliminating anybody who'd been fired since then
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.200]   and setting the same check out a second time.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.960]   And it all started, this was the thing that was devastating.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   The way these attackers got in,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   it was Fin6 is the name
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.840]   that's given to this hacking community
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.120]   'cause they're financial only.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.760]   They're not like Mafiosos, they're just trying to make money.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.400]   Is they intercepted an email
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.480]   from an Italian client of Norse Kydro
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.880]   to the company, didn't modify the email,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.160]   there was an attachment,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   they took the benign attachment, turned it into the malware
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.320]   and forwarded it on.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   So for the person receiving it,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.240]   it was exactly the email they expected
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.920]   from an existing customer
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.920]   with an attachment they expected.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.520]   They opened it. - Oh, wow.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.720]   - And that's it.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.280]   The infection happened in December.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.960]   The attackers had complete access to the network
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.720]   as far as anybody could tell
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.200]   until they triggered the ransomware in March.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   - Yes.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.400]   - Four months, they're wandering around in the network,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.640]   probably exfiltrating whatever they could,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.080]   finding whatever they can,
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.040]   figuring out what the attack points are
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.640]   and then launching the attack four months later.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.280]   And it was, in fact, I'm surprised it was only $60 million.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.960]   We've seen companies lose a billion dollars
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.480]   in ransomware attacks.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.440]   So it seems like they got off a little bit like,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.600]   but it's a stunning story.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.480]   But it doesn't make you think,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.080]   let me just finish the thought,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.560]   'cause I wanna bring it back to what we were talking about.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.360]   Was it does make you think
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.600]   that on-prem computer systems may not be
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.400]   going forward this most secure thing to do.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.480]   - Right.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.320]   Yeah. - I'm sorry, point points.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.640]   - I mean, it's-
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.880]   - No, no, I work for a very small company.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.400]   So, you know, fast company, seen it, obviously,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.040]   a giant, you know, big publishing companies.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.600]   I work for a company that employs six or eight people.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   We were also hit with a ransomware attack.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.440]   - It worked.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.280]   - I didn't know, yeah.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.440]   I don't think I ever mentioned this.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.840]   - No.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.280]   - We just, you know, we had a backup.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.120]   So, you know, we kinda just reset everything
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.880]   and we went back.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.240]   But I later found out to my amusement
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   that the amount of money they asked for with us
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.000]   was $478.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.480]   - Oh, my God.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   - Look at them selling them.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.720]   - I think they adjusted based on the size of the company.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.320]   So, you only figured that was all we could afford.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.160]   - So the ranch-
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.360]   - And they have a per head count, maybe,
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   inside of them.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.120]   - The ransomware request for this one was unknown.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   It said contact us, let's negotiate.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.720]   But North Skyro never did.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.120]   They said, "We are not gonna pay
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.960]   because we don't wanna look like a soft mark."
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.040]   I'm sure they had backups,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.600]   but the problem was it was so distributed,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.240]   35,000 employees in Europe, in the US, in Brazil.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.840]   And so much of their stuff was on-premises,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.160]   computers running processes.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.760]   They talk about the New York aluminum factory
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.320]   that used, you know, was heavily computerized
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.560]   to know what to make, what molds to use.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   They had to go to a paper system, in faxes.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.280]   They have 50,000 different aluminum dies
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.760]   for making different parts.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.600]   And it uses software to keep track of what's being made,
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.960]   to tell employees which die to pick off the shelf.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.400]   They had no idea what to make
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.200]   'cause it was all on a computer somewhere.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.880]   So that's, I mean, that's gonna be one
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.560]   of many impetus is moving, admittedly,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.440]   internet, fast internet, it's not global,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.200]   but I bet you every single North Skyro facility
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.080]   has a fast connection.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.120]   Why wouldn't they move this stuff into the cloud?
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.120]   The biggest trouble they had getting back online
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.680]   wasn't that they didn't have backups,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.560]   but that they had to go through every single machine
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.920]   and make sure there was nothing malicious on it.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.760]   - Right.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   - 'Cause the guys were there for four months.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.600]   They could have hit little time bombs everywhere.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.920]   - They could everything, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.840]   - I'm currently checking my Garmin watch,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.040]   like every 10 minutes to see if it works again.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.680]   And I have no idea. - Is that back yet?
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.320]   - Not as of a little bit before we started this.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.400]   I had no idea the degree to which my watch
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.120]   was heavily dependent on Garmin services
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.400]   to just get stuff onto my phone.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.720]   I kind of thought there was much more of a direct connection
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.160]   between watch and phone rather than watch
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.200]   to a Garmin cloud server back to phone.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.160]   - They've been down for three days.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   Also due to a ransom wear attack.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.920]   - And I'm so lucky to work again.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.320]   - This is our thing.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.160]   - Yeah.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.360]   - I'm torn, I kind of, I hope that Garmin is able
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.960]   to get back and running without paying anybody anything.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.120]   Apparently there's some question
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   whether it's even legal for them to pay,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.880]   but I'd like my watch to work,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.440]   but I'm also a little bit patient
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.280]   because it's such a terrible precedent to pay these people.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.200]   - Yeah, the last I read Garmin had not decided
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.240]   whether to pay or not.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.000]   They were considering it.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.160]   - I hope they have really good backups.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.600]   So though apparently even if you have backups
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.800]   they can instantly get infected.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.480]   - Yes, they have to be cold backups, right?
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.680]   If it's a hot backup.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.640]   And by the way, you could thank the services
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   of the National Security Agency, the NSA
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.960]   for making it possible to so quickly worm through networks
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.640]   with the fine eternal blue malware that they,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.600]   oops, accidentally leaked out a few years ago
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.000]   and is widely used by ransomware attacks
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.440]   to spread over networks.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.560]   I don't know if these attacks used to turn on blue or not.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.360]   - So Garmin services have been down for three days.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.520]   - That's incredible.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.360]   - The other thing, maybe more concerning is four days.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.480]   - Yeah, the other thing more concerning, maybe is
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.920]   a lot of aviation uses it.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.560]   - That's terrifying.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.640]   Well, good thing nobody's flying right now, right?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.120]   Like no one's going anywhere.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.360]   But that's, no, that is terrifying.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.200]   That is terrifying.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.280]   - They need totally up to date data for flight maps.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.120]   - Right.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.080]   - Fly Garmin and as a result, the Fly Garmin website,
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.240]   mobile app are down, call centers are down,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.360]   unable to receive calls, emails or chats.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.200]   - Gosh.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.040]   - Wow.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.640]   And I don't, in the case of North Cairo,
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.760]   they were well prepared.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.680]   In fact, it could have been worse if they,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.320]   in the middle of the night, they had,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.480]   somebody saw something with it had been going on
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.280]   and they had a response that they had,
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.040]   they had a playbook that they had planned
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.520]   and they implemented it immediately
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.720]   and it still was devastating.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.200]   - Not enough.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.440]   - So I don't know how you planned for that.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.360]   So that is one argument for getting,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.760]   I don't know, would it be safer in the cloud?
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.400]   - It's so hard because, you know,
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.000]   it's the same argument that people have
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.080]   of why they keep physical media, right?
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.560]   So it's like, oh, I have, you know,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.040]   I like to collect blue rays because, you know,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.760]   I'm not, you know, I have friends who are like this
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.320]   who are very much like, they want physical media
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.720]   because they are like, I can't trust
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.560]   that a company is going to be in business.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.000]   And then what happens to all of the things
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.160]   that I purchased there?
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.000]   They're just digital, they're, they're nothing.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.520]   It's a bunch of bits.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.640]   And they're just like, and I won't have that anymore.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.080]   And so it's a very similar type of argument where,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.240]   you know, there's something to be said
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.560]   for a physical backup, a physical copy, you know?
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.560]   And it's, it's, it is one of the biggest flaws, I guess,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.560]   or one of the biggest risks in, in going entirely digital.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.640]   Got to be prepared.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.160]   And even then, like you said, it's, you could be prepared,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.880]   you could have a book, you could have everything ready to go
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.600]   and it still might not be enough.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.840]   - Well, it seems like there ought to be something we could,
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.480]   there ought to be something we could do.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.320]   I guess we're, it's, I talked to a CEO on the radio show,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.680]   it was the last call on the radio show in an hour ago.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.320]   Who said, we got attacked, we fortunately,
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.080]   we had a mirrored knock.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.600]   We had two network centers.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.800]   One was a mirror of the other.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.880]   And just by good fortune, we were, this was the plan.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.960]   We were able to switch over.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.080]   So we were only out for a couple of hours.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.040]   We were able to get fully up and running.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   He says, is that enough?
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.920]   I said, well, you're just lucky that there wasn't a connection
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.480]   at that moment between those two mirrors,
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.960]   'cause you could have mirrored the attack
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.600]   and then you'd be out of luck.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.000]   I don't know what you do.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.760]   I really don't know what you do.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.960]   Be it a good topic for maybe our next last past seminar.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.280]   (laughs)
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.040]   What do you do?
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.960]   What do you do?
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.320]   Well, that's yours lots to talk about.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   We'll talk more.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.000]   Is there anything more to say about the Xbox thing?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.520]   When are they gonna announce XCloud?
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.840]   Do you know, Paul?
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.040]   When is that gonna be officially public?
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.960]   - XCloud becomes part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.360]   I think, I wanna say it's an,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.680]   I thought they said end of August, which sounds pretty soon.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.520]   - End of August?
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.400]   I feel like I just heard end of August as well.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.240]   - Soon. - So.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.080]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.160]   - Soon. - That's soon.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.000]   Yeah, that's pretty soon.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.800]   - Somebody has to blink first, right?
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.480]   We're gonna get pricing.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.000]   I assume next month it has to be in August,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.760]   because then you're giving people about 90 days
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.240]   to decide whether or not they wanna pre-order,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.160]   you know, a relatively large purchase.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.400]   Yeah, I feel like it has to be next month.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.880]   But they're playing chicken with each other
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.240]   because I think Xbox is a little bit,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.040]   they don't wanna repeat of the 3.99 moment at E3.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.760]   That was like, that was really not good.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.440]   - Fill us in, what was that?
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.600]   - So Xbox had announced, okay, here's our console,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.040]   here's how much it costs, all this stuff.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.200]   And then at the end of this PlayStation E3 conference,
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.800]   it comes out and he's like 3.99.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.920]   Like that was it, it was just like 3.99.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.480]   - This is the original, the PS4, you mean?
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.320]   - Yeah, the PS4.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.080]   And people lost their freaking minds.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.160]   Like it was just such a mic drop moment to come out
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.320]   and say, oh yeah.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.120]   Microsoft was bundling Connect.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.680]   Yeah, so it was 2.99.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.000]   - Yeah, they're bundling Connect, so it's expensive,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.960]   it was 4.99 and Sony just comes out and is like 3.99.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.560]   - So that's why you play chicken, you wait,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.080]   you hope the somebody will announce a price
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.480]   so you can undercut it.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.320]   - Yeah.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.400]   (laughs)
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.000]   - Or at least match it, right?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.080]   It's like, oh, yeah, it's a safe place.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.480]   - Yeah, don't get caught with your pants down.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.800]   - That's what they're waiting for.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.040]   - So, but both of them are doing that.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.280]   - Sony had got, Sony bought Gai-Kai,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.320]   they still have cloud gaming.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.320]   - They have PlayStation now.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.160]   - Yeah.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.840]   - It's not as robust as Game Pass, not as robust.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.400]   I think they will find potentially an incentive
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.000]   to expand on it quite a bit,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.640]   maybe in this next console generation.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.040]   I mean, they should, if they're looking at Microsoft,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.160]   I mean, that is something they should be very interested in.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.800]   But they're relying right now on a lot of exclusives.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.640]   A lot of exclusives.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.480]   - And can you play PlayStation now on anything
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.680]   or do you have to have a PlayStation to play it?
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.960]   - So, usually I think some of the games you can play
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.320]   not on PlayStation now are like exclusive to certain consoles.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.120]   - On a PS4 or PC, but not on your--
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.200]   - Yeah, I thought it was--
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.560]   - I thought it was PS, yeah, PC and PS4.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.200]   - So, and then there's Google's Stadia,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.840]   which you could pretty much play anywhere,
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.440]   including on a TV set.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   - Which, but Stadia is kind of,
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.680]   it always felt like Stadia was sort of a proof of concept.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.760]   I'm still waiting on that.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.000]   Google is not, their track record's not that great
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.960]   with trying new stuff.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.560]   They try so much.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.400]   And then--
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.240]   - Their big mistake--
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.360]   - So, these things actually end up lasting
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.240]   for a really long time.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.000]   - Was there's free there, but most people pay a monthly fee,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.800]   but you don't get in it, you get some limited games.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.480]   The, it's weird 'cause you buy the game at full price.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.320]   - But you don't own it.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   - But you don't own it, it's on their server.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.160]   - Yeah.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.400]   - That has to be a sticking point for some people.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.760]   It would be for me. - It is.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.600]   - And when you stop subscribing,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.360]   you no longer have access to that game.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.640]   - Buy by game. - Like, yeah, you bought it.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.960]   You paid full price for it.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.520]   You know, it's like, for a subscription,
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.360]   that's different.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.400]   Obviously, you stop your subscription, you lose access.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.200]   Like, people understand that.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   But yeah, to pay $60 for something like a, you know,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.960]   Destiny 2 or a Assassin's Creed or whatever it is,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.760]   and then just not have access to it
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.280]   once you decide that service isn't for you anymore is,
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.240]   yeah, a lot of people aren't interested in that.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.000]   - Will XCloud be Stadia-like in the sense
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.080]   that you could play it on any device,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.920]   except that it's a subscription price
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.960]   that includes a bunch of games, the game.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.800]   Right there. - Yeah.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.640]   - It's Game Pass Plus.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.440]   - Yeah, it's basically an extension of the Xbox
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.640]   ecosystem to other device types using streaming.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   So, but it's gonna be a subset.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   I mean, I think that of what you get from Xbox Game Pass
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.960]   and from what you get just from Xbox.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.640]   - So not every game on Xbox Game Pass
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.080]   will be available on XCloud, but some subset will be available.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.480]   - Right now, I think it's about 100 games.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.440]   I might be confusing that with Xbox Game Pass,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.160]   but it's a fairly limited selection,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.840]   but it's in preview right now.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.160]   - Paul, do you think they're gonna charge
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.400]   an extra surcharge to have access to XCloud,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.920]   or do you think it will be just included,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.680]   but limited in scope?
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.760]   - I think it's just gonna be included
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.200]   'cause Xbox Game Pass is actually pretty expensive.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.360]   Per month, it's $14.99.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.480]   And there aren't really great ways to get a good deal on that.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.080]   You know, you probably saw they got rid of the one year Xbox.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.320]   Gold, Xbox Live Gold subscription.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.400]   You can't get a 12 month pass on anymore.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.120]   So I think I'd have to look it up, but Xbox Game Pass.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.600]   - Or even a six month pass too, right?
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   - Yeah, like a one, three, six something would be better
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.000]   than, you know, footing, whatever that is, $150, whatever.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.760]   - Well, my most excited story of the week
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.160]   is the fact that XPlay is still playing Pong
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.840]   in that deserted warehouse.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.680]   This is a-
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.520]   - Eggplant bag, baby!
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.520]   - Big promo from something called G4 TV
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.480]   that apparently Comcast is gonna bring back next year.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.060]   And this tagline is, "We never stopped playing."
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:25.160]   A lot of people tweeted me saying, "What do you think?"
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.800]   He said, "Oh, please."
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.720]   - Yeah.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.440]   - Leo, you're not gonna have a Twitch show?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   - Yeah, somehow I don't think they're gonna be inviting me.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.320]   - You're not gonna stream do skis?
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.160]   - Oh, I don't think.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.880]   - Oh, I could be the good old gamer.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.480]   - That's what I'm gonna do that on Twitch.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.560]   I'm gonna start doing like a band and wear on Twitch.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.400]   That's gonna be-
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.320]   - That's a little fun summer pandemic project for me.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.480]   - Yeah, like a Sierra game live, you know?
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.720]   - Yeah, totally, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.320]   Gotta play a Freddy Farkus, Frontier Pharmacist.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.160]   - Yes, there you go.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   - I'm just gonna give you my gosh game show to you.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.200]   - Lisa Street Larry or Duke Nukem.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.240]   What was the predecessor to a Doom?
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.080]   Remember that game?
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.400]   - Wolfenstein 3D, right?
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120]   - Wolfenstein and then, but even before that,
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.360]   there was a little guy that flew around.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.520]   - Hurry on.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.360]   - Remember that?
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.200]   - He'd be in the side.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.040]   - Was he a good way of scrolling?
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.920]   - No, no, it was, it was kind of like Duke Nukem
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.680]   in very low res.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.800]   So it made it, yeah.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.640]   It was a kitty game.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.080]   It was kind of a kitty theme thing.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.640]   - Oh man, I-
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.000]   - I loved it, I think I remember the name.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.080]   - Yeah, isn't that funny?
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.880]   - It was probably 'cause they made it for Apigee
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.120]   or something back at that time, right?
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.240]   It wasn't an id game.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   It was before id had their own game.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.080]   - It was pre id.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.920]   - Or id was id, yeah.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.720]   - It's better on like one floppy disk, I think.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.560]   - Yeah.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.400]   (laughing)
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.240]   - Yeah, what was the name of that?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.160]   - It's 'cause I'm kind of kid something coming.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.560]   - Commander Keen, thank you.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.160]   - Commander Keen.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.360]   Commander Keen, it's back, baby.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.600]   I would pay money to watch Ashley Esquetha
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.760]   play Commander Keen on a Twitch stream.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.800]   - He may not even have to pay money to do it.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.200]   Maybe I'll just add it to less.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.040]   I only had, I was looking at a bunch of abandoned
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   where stuff the other day and I'm like,
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.720]   "Man, I should play some of these games on Twitch."
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.200]   'Cause I'm like, I don't, I'm not a streamer.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.000]   I don't know, I don't know that whole world.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.360]   And also sometimes it's a play game.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.200]   - I'm glad to hear you say that.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.280]   - I enjoy my life.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.240]   - You're young, you're hip.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   And--
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.320]   - I'm not hip, I wouldn't.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.640]   I would not use that word to describe myself,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.200]   but I'm enthusiastic.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.560]   So maybe, yeah, and I love all those old DOS games.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.160]   I love old point and click adventure.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.600]   I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, might be fun, why not?"
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.440]   - That's a great idea.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   If you don't do it on--
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.280]   (laughing)
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.120]   - All right.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.240]   - Except that I'd have to play games all the time.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.080]   - Why?
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.160]   - Oh, I'm just here.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.000]   - I'm just here to remember.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.840]   - Oh, no.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.400]   (laughing)
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.760]   - Sorry, I hung up on you guys.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.280]   I was really upset about the game, I think.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.120]   - Yeah, I don't blame you.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.400]   Yeah, you had to go find your floppy.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.400]   - You stole your idea.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.240]   It's fine.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.040]   (laughing)
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.600]   - Let's take a little break.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.360]   That was our gaming segment.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.600]   That was a lot to talk about.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.960]   I'm very interested.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.840]   I feel like of the three, it's three, right?
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.480]   I mean, on live's gone, there's nobody else.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.640]   It's PlayStation now, Stadia, I guess.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.880]   - Amazon's coming.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.240]   Amazon's gonna do something.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.080]   - Amazon's gonna do something.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.160]   - And there's Xclav.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.680]   - I think Sony will do something like--
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.360]   - Sony will do something.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.400]   Yeah, they'll evolve PlayStation now.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.240]   It's just, it's not quite as--
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.200]   - I feel like Xclav is the one to beat right now.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.040]   - Wow.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.880]   - I really agree with that.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.720]   I think it's very good.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.800]   - Just like Windows Phone was the one to beat in 2010.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.640]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.840]   (laughing)
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.200]   - You know, I know, I will go to my grave.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.880]   I will go to my grave, Paul.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.320]   I will go to my grave arguing that the sound
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.480]   of the keyboard made in Windows Phone
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.280]   was the best sound.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.160]   - Wow, you're probably right.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.200]   - That little, it's like a soft pop.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.280]   It was the most perfect--
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.680]   - Soft perfection.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.520]   Is that what you're looking for?
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   - I thought it'd be perfect sound.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   (laughing)
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.640]   It was the best sound.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.480]   - Yeah.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.760]   - There's no knock on Windows Phone.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.600]   It just didn't make it.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.000]   It was really great.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.840]   It just didn't make it.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   - Yeah, it just, yeah.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.240]   Wasn't quite there.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.000]   - That wasn't the zoom of smartphones.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.320]   - No, late.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.040]   - The kin was the zoom of smartphones.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.480]   - The kin was the zoom of smartphones.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.320]   - The zoom was the zoom of phones.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.160]   - The sound was the zoom.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.280]   - My son used to kin for a couple of years.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.080]   He loved that phone.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.840]   - Really, so they only sold it for three months,
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.800]   but he used it for two years.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.640]   - Of course, I had two of them.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.480]   I made them use it.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.120]   It was like, you got your overall underizing,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.840]   you're using the stamp thing.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.680]   - Did he loved it?
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.000]   - Did the kid also have soft perfection?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.560]   (laughing)
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.920]   - He had a little helmet, he had a win.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.200]   He was, you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.040]   I mean, he wasn't getting an iPhone, I can tell you that.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.480]   - Uh huh.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.840]   You're not getting an iPhone, kids.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.440]   A dream on.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.280]   - Here's your kin.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.120]   - Here's your kin.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.960]   That's cool.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.640]   - Enjoy getting top in the room.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.880]   - Accept this as the punishment that it is.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.160]   - You're gonna get a wedgie when you go to school,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.320]   but that's okay.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.480]   - It's a good stuff to do to a locker.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.000]   - Character building.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.920]   That's right.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.960]   Ashley's got this here.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.720]   Seeing your producer, it's seen as great to see you again.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.520]   How old's the baby now?
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.280]   - He turned a year old last month,
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.440]   in last month.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.280]   So yeah, he's running, talking, says hi.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.000]   - Hi, hi, hi.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.840]   - Maybe we'll get a cameo, we haven't seen him in a while.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.440]   - Maybe he has been skipping his afternoon nap.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.280]   - Oh.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   - So he just like rolls around in his crib,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.720]   talking himself for an hour and a half,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.400]   which basically I do in bed, in my own bed.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.760]   I talk to myself for an hour and a half,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.520]   but it's way less cute.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.040]   - Do you fantasize your broadcasting?
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.160]   - Was he talking about, I'm sure, yeah.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   - Playing your good old game and practicing your--
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.240]   - Are yelling at people like, Overwatch.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.320]   (laughing)
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.160]   - Yeah, that's how loud.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.520]   - Ah!
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.080]   Harry McCrack and the Technologizer,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.960]   also here from Fast Company, great to see you.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.160]   And your classic TWA poster.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.600]   - Yes, I put that up, so I'd have something in the back
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.680]   when I do Zoom calls and Skype calls and so forth.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.880]   They also have a bug spending,
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.960]   so which I don't think you can see.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.600]   - Yeah, I see it when you bow down.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.120]   Right above your Epson printer.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:55.960]   Nice to see you.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.800]   - Sorry.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.920]   - Yep, and of course Paul Therot,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.760]   Z-Therot@Therot.com.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.800]   - I also have a printer.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.160]   - He also has a printer.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.000]   What is that printer?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.080]   That is, it looks like an old--
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.760]   - It's an HP, all in one.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.480]   - Oh, it's very white.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.720]   - Yes, two paper trays, Leo, it's really nice.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.040]   - Ooh, fancy.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Fancy, fancy.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.880]   I'm actually amazed at the number of our hosts
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.440]   and contributors who have printers in their shot.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.960]   Stacey Hickenbotham also has a printer in your shot.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.800]   I try to keep mine in cabinets well below eye level,
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.720]   but it's just me.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.600]   - I'm looking at mine, it's way up on the top of a bookshelf.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.720]   - We possibly have five printers in this house.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   - Oh yeah.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.160]   - Oh, we have at least five at home.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.360]   Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.840]   - What are you printing?
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.680]   - Nothing.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.600]   - It's the beauty of it.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   - But if we--
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.240]   - I'd have to like brother laser printer,
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.080]   it's like black and white.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.920]   - We ever have to.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.640]   - It's like sometimes I have to print out like a form or something.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   - I printed a form yesterday.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.520]   I did a 401K form yesterday,
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.800]   which I printed and started to fill in by hand,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.360]   but my hand cramped up after a few letters.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.880]   - So he goes like, "Ten?"
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.360]   - I can't use a pen.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   So I then fired up my PDF form filler and laboriously.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.960]   This is not an easy thing to do, it's not a form.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.080]   To carefully, you type everything out
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.680]   and it's all whopper, jawed and kooky and online
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.160]   and you drag everything in line
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.960]   and then you have to select it all and select courier.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.400]   So it looks like you typed it.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.680]   It took me like four hours for one page.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.400]   (laughing)
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.000]   It's like, and this is the future.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.240]   This is how technology is changing the world.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.440]   I showed they brought to you by ExtraHop.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.080]   Oh, these guys are cool.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.440]   They originally started to do performance monitoring,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.480]   but they can do so much more in this new IT reality
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   where remote access is on a massive scale
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.480]   and we're all working at home.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.640]   Cloud is happening, multi-cloud is happening.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.760]   Constant increase in the devices in your home,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.640]   the internet of things devices,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.400]   and add on top of that the crazy rise in cyber crime.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   And now imagine yourself as an organization
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.760]   trying to keep track of all of that.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.920]   From the cloud to the data center to the customer,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.800]   that's where ExtraHop is such a big help.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.680]   It gives you something you need
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.800]   to protect and scale your business,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.400]   unified visibility and a context for the things you're seeing.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.440]   Plus, if it does it right,
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.640]   you're gonna have intelligence response workflows
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.920]   so that teams can collaborate easily
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.760]   and respond quickly to any situation.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.240]   That is ExtraHop.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.160]   It helps you detect threats and performance issues,
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   95% faster and respond 60% more efficiently.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.880]   This is exactly the kind of tool you need
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   in this ransomware high vulnerability world.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.000]   ExtraHop helps keep your business secure
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.600]   and available with SAS-based cloud native network detection
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.640]   and responsive gut sensors everywhere.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.760]   I'll give you some examples,
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.080]   Wizards of the Coast, you know them.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.880]   Of course, Magic, the Gathering.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.080]   They secure and support their AWS cloud using ExtraHop.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.520]   The last thing you want is,
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.160]   oh yeah, they left a bucket open online
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.560]   and we got all the data out of it.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.000]   No, that's the last thing you want.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.160]   Chief Architect and Information Security Officer
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.360]   at Wizards of the Coast, Dan McDaniel,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.640]   said, "There is no other company
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.720]   "that aligns to supporting the DevOps model.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.920]   "We use the speed, the lack of friction,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.800]   "than ExtraHop."
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   Altibuty uses ExtraHop to secure their Google Cloud
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.440]   and to keep networking and security teams closely aligned
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.360]   so engineers can focus on innovation.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.160]   Senior IT engineer, John Cree, says,
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.640]   "Before ExtraHop, we had limited visibility
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.200]   "to what was going on in our cloud,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.880]   "but now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.960]   "and understand how our applications
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.360]   "are performing in the cloud."
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.320]   We know now, I'm just that story about Norris Chydro,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   that every minute counts when you detect a threat
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.000]   and how you respond and how quickly you respond
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.160]   determines exactly how much it's gonna cost you
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.400]   in the long run, how quickly and well you will respond.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.440]   You need a plan, you need the sensors
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.320]   and you need actionable alerts
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.200]   and that's what you get with ExtraHop.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.640]   Take control of your cloud security right now.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.800]   Go to ExtraHop.com/Twit
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.320]   and if you want the best eye candy,
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.040]   they have a really fun full product demo online.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.080]   You can actually watch it at work.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.880]   ExtraHop.com/Twit, you will say,
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.680]   "Oh, I gotta have this, I need this kind of information."
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.120]   There's also some great information there
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.360]   in securing and supporting remote access.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.920]   That's all available free right now,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.120]   ExtraHop.com/Twit.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.680]   These guys are right on point
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.400]   for what you need in today's scary world.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.160]   ExtraHop.com/Twit.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:00.560]   (mumbles)
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.760]   It's gonna be Red Velvet Cake.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.040]   Sounds tasty, sounds delicious.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.680]   That's a joke I have with my daughter.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.840]   Red Velvet Cake is nothing more than chocolate cake
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   that's a different color.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.360]   Yeah, with a little coffee.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.200]   A little coffee.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.640]   But I insist that it is the apex of cake taste.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.080]   I agree 100%.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.000]   We learned this on all about Android.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.160]   I gotta say, congratulations to our all about Android team.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.480]   Jason Howell and Ron Richards and Florence Iam
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.600]   because they had Android Vice President of Engineering,
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.440]   David Burgh.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.520]   Oh, sure he looks.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.800]   Look at Jason's face.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.600]   Yeah, he's very cocky.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   (laughs)
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   That's the face of a man who's like, "I got us."
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.720]   He's determined.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.200]   I'm getting a scoop.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.160]   Nobody knew what Android 11 would be called.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   We knew it would be Android R.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.480]   They didn't have a dessert name for Q.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.880]   Nicole, even though they didn't announce it publicly,
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.120]   Burgh, two scoops really for you.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.720]   Two scoops of delicious Android ice cream for you, Jason Howell.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.880]   'Cause Burgh said internally, Q was Quince Tarte.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.200]   They just never told anybody.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.080]   And while the dessert name stopped being used
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.200]   for public releases, they still used them internally.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.880]   And once again, Android 11 is referred to internally
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.600]   at Google as RVC or Red Velvet Cake.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.920]   But Burgh says, "We're not gonna use that one publicly either."
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.120]   But at least we know.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.480]   I wanna think Red Velvet Cake every time.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.720]   It's gonna look really disturbing.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.920]   I feel like cut into an Android cake.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.240]   And it just looks like internal.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.120]   It'd just be really creepy.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.240]   Well, in fact, the folks at XDA developers
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.800]   made an illustration worthy of Paul Thoron.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.640]   Exactly like that.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.480]   There it is.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.400]   (laughing)
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.280]   It's a little bloody in there.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.920]   It just, it looks a little wrong, right?
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.760]   Oh, it looks tasty.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.000]   So it doesn't quite look.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.040]   I mean, it does make me want cake,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   but also it does look very upsetting.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.960]   They stopped, I always said,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.080]   they stopped doing the statues.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.560]   Remember they had the little statue garden?
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.880]   Yeah, it's so heavy.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.920]   They had little statues out there.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   And actually, I hadn't seen it in a while,
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.680]   but apparently it was getting kind of ratty.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.520]   Sure.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.280]   You know, like there used to be an amusement park
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.160]   in Santa Cruz over the hill just by born on
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.560]   called Santa's Village.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.520]   So it's like a rundown of--
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.480]   Yeah, it's like, it's like,
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.960]   stuff out of a horror game.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.800]   Yep.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.640]   (laughing)
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.480]   It's kinda like,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.320]   "Oh, oh, oh."
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.160]   She just put McDonald's things out there now.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.520]   Like, like, Mary McCheese,
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.680]   you know, the hamburger.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.800]   By those Chuck E. Cheese,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.720]   those old Chuck E. Cheese,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.360]   animatronic, that are no longer being used.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.200]   Talk about their view.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.040]   The Hall of Presidents could be out there.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.360]   The Hall of Presidents.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.120]   Yeah, I mean, there's a little bit of an unusual animatronic.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.920]   I'm sure they could figure out.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   It was a fiberglass.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   The fiberglass starts to look a little thread-bearing,
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.080]   kind of see through some of the--
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:51.920]   Not a good thing.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.440]   (laughing)
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   That would be a great game though.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.560]   You know, Google's really a struggling company, Leo,
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.400]   and they cannot afford--
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.240]   I know, they can't afford it.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.600]   It's to upkeep fiberglass.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.080]   This is like, just absurd.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.560]   You can't ask them to do such things.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.720]   So sad.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.560]   Maybe they got tired of the tourism.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.080]   Like, all the Android fans coming
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.120]   to take pictures with it.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.720]   I thought that was a good one.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.120]   Yeah, I brought my friend over there.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:12.960]   I thought that was a fortune.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.880]   Maybe they got tired of it.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.720]   Maybe they were just like,
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.560]   "Okay, we're kind of over this.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.200]   Like, we don't want anybody coming over here anymore.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.160]   We just let 'em rot in the sun."
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.360]   Yeah, they were starting to look a little.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.920]   There's Jelly Bean, honeycomb.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.440]   They abandoned those statues like--
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.000]   Ice cream sandwich, gingerbread.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.120]   Is that Eclair?
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:32.960]   Oh my God.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.480]   They just, they just,
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.840]   they were sitting in the sun.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.360]   They were baking.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.240]   They just, but they were big.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   I didn't realize they were that big.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.080]   They were so cute.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.280]   I have a whole box of those like little series
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.480]   on Android figurines.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   I wrote about--
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.200]   So I think we're in Zebra.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.800]   I wrote about IBM's original San Jose campus,
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.040]   which at least last time I chapped is still there,
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.320]   but it's in ruins.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.480]   And it's next door to allows home improvement center.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.600]   And it's kind of fascinating
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.560]   because I've seen photographs of IBM's campus
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.720]   back when it was new.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.040]   And it looks incredible.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.600]   And it's just sort of slow--
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   It's hard to about say.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   It's sad.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.080]   So it's like an auto industry thing from Detroit.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.760]   Hard to put it just this really nice
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.320]   1950s building that's slowly falling apart.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.880]   And there's a sculpture which is lying
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.440]   on the ground getting rusty.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.480]   It's the Chernobyl of Silicon Valley.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.800]   Are influencers there taking pictures of it?
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.320]   Because it's not too great enough.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   Just me.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   There's a fluency here.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.800]   I don't think yeah.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.520]   So we were in the chat room and said--
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.840]   So we were in the chat room saying,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.960]   and maybe it's true, Khrushchev visited that site.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.360]   That's what I discovered.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.360]   He was there.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   He was there.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   He was there.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   He was there.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   He was there.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   He was there.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   He was there.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   He was there.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   He was there.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   He visited it in 1959 or something.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   It's true.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   Oh my god.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.360]   I wrote about it on past company several years ago.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.360]   Oh my god.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   Oh my god.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.360]   Oh, I'm sure in 1959 it was the office complex of the future.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   It was.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.360]   It was a lot like a Silicon Valley campus.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   It had like great food.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   And it was informal by IBM standards.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   Oh my god.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   There he is.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   IBM headquarters.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.760]   Looks like a community college.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.680]   The Soviet premier does, doesn't it?
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.880]   Every school in America built in that era looks like that.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.440]   Kind of flat.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.320]   Diamond shaped windows.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   Wow.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.320]   Wow.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.080]   The keto Khrushchev in the IBM plant.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.080]   And there they are.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.320]   Look at the size of those motherboards.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   Oh, she's--
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.320]   Holy cow.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.320]   Well, literally the hardwired.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.320]   The hard drive wasn't better there.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.320]   Oh wow.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.200]   What great footage.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.360]   That was from a PBS show American experience.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.520]   It's called Cold War Roadshow.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:51.560]   And it features commentary by Chris Chafson Sergei who was there with his father.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.520]   The one thing people remember is that Chris Chaf wanted to go to Disneyland and they wouldn't
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.520]   let him.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:01.760]   But as the second choice he got to visit IBM and I think maybe I could John Deere factory
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   or something.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   Jesus.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.760]   I thought you were going to say not to very far.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   OK.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   Nikita.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   Right.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   I can't go to Disneyland.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   I'm going to go to not.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   Not very far.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.240]   That's where that's exactly why not spray farm exists for people who can't make it to
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   Disneyland.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   Look at this.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   Look at that sculpture in the water.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   It kind of looks like Epoch.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   Beautiful.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   City of the world.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   I think that looks great.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.240]   That's where you might have a picture of the ruins too.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.240]   Oh really?
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.880]   Is there a three-eyed fish in the ponto?
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.280]   The ghost of the river.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Oh wow.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.360]   There's the cafeteria.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   But come on.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   Those chairs.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   Those are great lawn chairs.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.520]   Having lawn chairs like that in there out there.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   I found some of those in Animal Crossing.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.520]   They look great.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.320]   They're in a pool area.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.960]   Oh, here's the Ray Mac, Ramac computer.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.920]   I'm the pride of Santa's.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.640]   Random access memory accounting computer.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.880]   I think it was like the first computer with a hard drive maybe or something like that.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.280]   Those hard drives are so big.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   Remember that?
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.440]   They took a plane to 747.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.640]   Oh, there's the lows.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:07.320]   Supposedly that the tiles on those lows refer to punch cards.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   Oh wow.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.320]   Oh wow.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:15.200]   Well, and it looks like the original, is that like part of the original building that
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.960]   they used for the lows?
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.680]   They tore down.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.880]   There was a mysterious fire in one of the original buildings and after it burned down
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   they built the lows.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.360]   I've been back since I took this photo here and it's in worst shape and it was when I
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.280]   wrote the story a few years ago.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.480]   Look at this sculpture that we saw in the fountain.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.480]   It's now on the ground.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   The fountain is empty.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.640]   Oh man.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.320]   That's just, that says everything about Silicon Valley and technology.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   Oh, and there's a part in this graph.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.280]   They did a little nod to the front of the IBM building, right?
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.600]   Like if we see the picture of the lows, the front of the lows?
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.080]   Yeah, apparently that does a reference to it.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.400]   And there's a little park called Ramac Park.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.240]   Wow.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.400]   So who owns that land?
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   Why is it still there?
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   I haven't really--
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.560]   A lot of it has been sold.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   I think there are some apartments.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.400]   Whoever bought IBM's hard drive division, maybe Western Digital, at least for a while,
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.800]   made hard drives there.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   Wow.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.920]   But that building there at least as of a couple of years ago or so was still there.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   Can you hear me?
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.840]   Who is the guy who said, "Sorry, Mr. Premier.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:25.240]   We can't go to Disneyland, but we have arranged visit to Tractor Factory."
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   Sure.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.040]   Not again.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   This is Nikita.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.040]   No.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.040]   Aw, man.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.600]   I can't take one more tractor.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.640]   That's why he said he was going to crush us.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.280]   He was really not at the position.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.800]   And he was really impressed by the cafeteria at IBM, more so than the computers.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.680]   He liked the tractors because he was in the farming technology.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Sure.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.680]   Computer is not so much.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.400]   Fast forward, Harry spent some time at a little bit more modern facility.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.040]   Google's ATAP lab.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.840]   This was your last trip before the quarantine.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.920]   And this was a great article.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:03.200]   We actually talked a lot about it when it came out on Fast Company a couple of weeks
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.640]   ago.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.040]   You got some great access there.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   That's...
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.240]   It was fun because they've been really quiet.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.000]   They used to get a lot of attention back when they started.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.040]   They were originally part of Motorola when it was part of Google.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.040]   And they spent a lot of time talking about stuff like security tags.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.560]   You could swallow and that kind of stuff.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.280]   And over the last few years, they just have not promoted themselves much.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.520]   They got merged into Google's hardware group.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:35.040]   And Soli, the radar technology and the Pixel 4 is kind of the one major thing that's come
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   out lately.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.040]   That's actually...
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   You have a picture of the Soli chip which is really tiny.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.560]   Small enough now to be embedded in a phone or other devices.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:50.400]   And their mission these days is sort of to try to give devices intelligence without trying
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.680]   to put all the smarts into the device itself.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.120]   So a lot of the intelligence can live in the cloud.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:00.880]   And the stuff I saw involved stuff like a smart remote control that you can kind of
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.240]   point at different devices in your house.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.680]   And like you can drag and drop something from...
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:10.000]   You can drag and drop a YouTube video to your speaker if you want to listen to it.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.840]   They're working on a smart pen that's a little bit like LiveScribe if you remember that.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.440]   You don't need to use special paper.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.560]   You can digitize your stuff just with ordinary paper.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.600]   And you can have it translate stuff on the fly and so forth.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:30.480]   This harkens back to the glory days of Bell Labs, AT&T's R&D facility.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.600]   Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, SRI.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.040]   These great blue sky research labs.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   Do companies...
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.440]   Is this something companies still do?
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.400]   We just don't know about it?
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.760]   Or is it less likely that you're going to see this kind of blue sky R&D in modern America?
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:51.160]   Well, I mean Google is still like rife with R&D labs of all sorts, like the Xlab and
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.840]   all kinds of stuff.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:58.280]   I think the interesting thing about ATAP is it's now very closely affiliated with Google's
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.680]   hardware operations.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.560]   And it's not entirely blue sky.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.480]   They really want to be ambitious, but they do want to create stuff that might logically
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.520]   show up in hardware Apple might...
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.320]   Sorry, Google might create.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.240]   And so it's at least very promising and nothing they've done so far has knocked it out of
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.480]   the park or changed the world.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:26.960]   Soli is really intriguing, but the Pixel 4 has apparently been a disappointment sales-wise.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.120]   Some people really like Soli.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.600]   Other people said that it was...
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:36.120]   That was the technology that let you wave in front of the phone and go to the next track.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.600]   And I have it.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.840]   I never once used it.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840]   Never used it.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.600]   Oh, Soli, they say it's so lie.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   Is that how they like to pronounce it?
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   I think I'm mispronouncing it probably.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.360]   I think it is Soli.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.640]   It also does things like if you, in order to conserve battery life, it can tell if you're
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.960]   like reaching towards your phone and it will turn on the face unlock before you've actually
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   looked at the phone.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.680]   Oh, so it is doing stuff even though I'm not aware of it that's value.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.760]   The all-time display is actually only always on if you're there.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.240]   Oh, interesting.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.440]   If you leave it knows you're not there and it can turn it all the way off.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   Well, that's cool.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.080]   You also talked about Jekard.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.320]   They're smart fabric technology.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.400]   That's not a number of things.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.480]   There's a backpack and Levi's jean jackets and...
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.680]   Oh, high priced limited value.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.360]   And a smart all for soccer players.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.560]   And that's not been a mass market success.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.880]   But when I talked to Dan Kaufmann, the head of the lab, he says it basically, there's
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.080]   value in getting stuff out even in small quantities.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.740]   Because if you have actual people buying stuff and using that, you will learn things you
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.600]   will not in like a beta test.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.400]   That makes sense.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:55.280]   Like in any beta test once you get it out to the public, like inevitably somebody thinks
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.400]   of something that just never considered.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:04.000]   The example they gave is there's something called the Levi's commuter jacket with Jekard
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:12.280]   built in and a woman bought it and she pointed out that when it gives navigation directions,
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:16.400]   it was giving these very detailed step by step directions.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:24.160]   And if it's a commuter jacket, people tend to know how to get to work and home and therefore
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.320]   they don't need those detailed directions.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.480]   And because the intelligence was in the cloud, they were able to adjust that.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.880]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   So they didn't have to...
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:38.120]   I think you have to have the fact that these people who buy these fairly expensive things
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   with Jekard built in have to have a certain amount of patience and understand that it's
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.920]   still someone emerging technology though.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.920]   That's a beta product.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.760]   This is the challenge for Silicon Valley.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:57.840]   So a lot of those early R&D labs, Xerox is the most famous Xerox park invented technologies
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.200]   we use today like crazy.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.480]   But Xerox never made a penny off of any of it.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.640]   It just filtered out into the world and was used by other people.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.520]   But they invented the mouse, the GUI, the menu, Windows, Laser Printer.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   Laser Printer.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.880]   In fact, there's a book how Xerox park invented the world.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.160]   It made no money.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.320]   I can't remember the exact name of it, but it's kind of sad.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:21.280]   And then on the other hand, fumbling the future, fumbling the future.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.840]   That's right.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:27.400]   And then on the other hand, you could do stuff, it looks like ATAP's doing, which is you're
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.880]   working very closely trying to make products, but the problem with Silicon Valley is everything
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.760]   they create seems to be driven by Silicon Valley and less by humans.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.800]   So it is nice if they can adapt over time.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:48.480]   Silicon Valley's strategy just seems to be create whatever you can and just throw it
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.520]   and see if any of it sticks because we don't know what people want.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.880]   Is that a reasonable point of view?
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.480]   Or should they be talking to people more?
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.000]   I think most about his glasses.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.760]   That seems to be what everybody is converged on as well.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.120]   That's going to be the next big thing.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.040]   But then somebody asked me yesterday on the radio show, what happened to voice assistants?
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.000]   How come ambient computing didn't become the next big thing?
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.640]   It's plateaued completely.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:21.040]   Yeah, that natural conversation thing was supposed to be the future.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.440]   You could walk in, the voice would understand context.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.760]   You could say, I want lights on, I want this done, whatever it is.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.080]   And all I get, I tore out all my smart speaker stuff.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.360]   All I get from this stuff is, sorry, Paul, I don't understand.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.280]   Yeah, I've thought of this on the wall.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.760]   Where was this photo taken?
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.760]   I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.240]   What do you mean you don't understand?
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.120]   You're showing a photo that I know has a metadata.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.280]   I would understand if I had access to the file.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.440]   It's crazy.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.800]   Did they give up?
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   What happened?
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:58.040]   Well, Amazon has had a bunch of pieces of news lately about ways to make Alexa more intelligent
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.680]   and to let it dive deeper into third party apps.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.840]   So there's certainly still at work at it.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.440]   Yeah, by the way, that's a great example of a company that does do a lot of research
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.360]   that is aimed at bringing products to market, not just aimed at listening to the concrete.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   Very concrete.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   Yeah, very concrete.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   And that's the stuff came out of some guys from Microsoft.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.360]   And Microsoft didn't think it had a future.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   They worked the Amazon sample.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.680]   And a perfect example.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.040]   That's what happens now is the people move.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.880]   The engineers say, well, you know what?
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.360]   It's a very fluid job market.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.360]   I'm going to go where somebody appreciates what I just thought of.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.360]   Right.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.640]   Well, how are they going to afford those half a million dollar a month apartment rentals
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.760]   in San Francisco without moving back and forth, Leo?
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.400]   They got to eat.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.520]   Was is suing YouTube?
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:51.680]   Was and a number of other people suing over a Bitcoin scam in his name.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.600]   He filed suit on Wednesday, Steve Wozniak, founder of Apple.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.720]   I just assume everybody knows what I'm talking about when I say was.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:05.480]   There were videos that used his name and likeness to convince viewers to send cryptocurrency
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.160]   during a fake Bitcoin giveaway, perhaps doubling.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.640]   Isn't this the same as the Twitter?
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   It's exactly the same name.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.200]   They even used Elon Musk and Bill Gates.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.960]   It was the event was on YouTube for months.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:26.440]   Promised to give viewers back double what they sent when viewers, of course, gave them cryptocurrency.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.640]   They didn't get anything back.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:33.400]   Woz and 17 other victims said that YouTube and Google repeatedly ignored their request
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.080]   to take down the scam video.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.600]   He said, if you do, but acted quickly, you have deep.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   Oh boy.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.600]   Deep fakes.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.000]   This is going to get even worse.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.240]   This is a problem that companies like YouTube and Twitter, any of these platforms, this
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.480]   is a big problem.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:58.840]   Not only are they dealing with what happened with the Twitter hack, you're dealing with
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.840]   this.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.720]   This is bad.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.720]   Sorry.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:10.080]   There's a weird disconnect here between how fast content gets taken down by some owner
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.400]   of a music or a video that thinks it's not for you.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.160]   It happens immediately.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.760]   And then when these people complain, these are high profile individuals, right?
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.720]   Barack Obama, Elon Musk, that's the Twitter part of it.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.720]   But it was.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.800]   You know, when Gates was, yeah.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.640]   Yeah, Woz was not complaining.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   Nothing.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   Months.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   Nothing.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   How does that happen?
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.480]   Woz's lawyer did exactly the same thing.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.840]   The Twitter took it down in minutes.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.160]   You're a lawyer for a washed up seventies musician.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.960]   You get heard immediately.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:48.320]   But if you're, even though all the person is doing is promoting your product at the end
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.960]   of a Windows weekly two weeks ago, Paul mentioned white lion.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.960]   Right.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.320]   And it was like, what's white lion?
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.320]   I had no idea.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   I bet.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:58.320]   We played a song.
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.320]   It's a song.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   I played a little clip of it.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.280]   The whole video got taken down.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   You should play it now.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.280]   So that because I don't think these guys know it.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   You're trying to get me taken down.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:15.040]   And it's like, if I were white lion, I'd be saying, yes, please play more.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.720]   Nobody has listened to our music since like 2003.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.000]   Maybe you'll sell an album or for instance, just send an invoice.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.880]   Like that's why it was like just sending invoice.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.560]   Well, they could they have an option to do it as a gift.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560]   It's fine.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.400]   They have an option in these takedowns.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.800]   You can say, just monetize it or remove their monetization or make my monetization or monetize
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800]   it for me.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.480]   I don't know what my album in there, but their choice was for some reason.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.480]   Take it down.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.400]   Well, you know, it's not them, right?
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.680]   It's some idiot in the law office in, you know, Los Angeles or whatever.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.280]   I don't want to remember that time in their lives.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.960]   Could be my hair white line.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.000]   We will promote your music when it makes sense.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.720]   You don't listen to Leo.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   We got this.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.640]   We got this.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.800]   What was the name of the song?
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   Wait, wait.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   Oh, yeah, we were talking about it in the in the context of waiting for Windows 10 2004.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.200]   It's going to replace me with this white lion song.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.240]   I used to know when I was, you know, 30 years younger.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   Wow.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   Leo said I've never heard of white lions.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   So apparently YouTube listens to white lions request to take it down somewhere.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.640]   A lawyer's ears went up.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   Boom.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.960]   Oh, no, this is like, here's a question.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960]   Okay.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.760]   So copyright wise, like we're talking about in frickin.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   Frangement IP infringement.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:39.920]   They said, why is a public figure likeness not considered the exact same thing, right?
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.360]   So it's like, if somebody files an infringement claim and says they're using my likeness,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.720]   why wouldn't that be taken down immediately just the same as they're using my music or
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.920]   using my.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:57.400]   The difference is that the the fingerprinting they do for music is automated and continuous.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400]   It's just matching.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.560]   And I don't think they have some.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560]   They should.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.720]   Maybe they should.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.520]   It's just, you know, this is more of a manual process.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.360]   So instead of taking seconds, it takes months because humans.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.720]   It just seems like a thing that you would, it seems like a thing YouTube should have
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.840]   been working on for ages, right?
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.440]   So like it is, oh, well, hey, if we're going to do this for music and we're going to do
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.600]   this for, you know, whatever video games, like if you're going to make these digital
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.280]   thumbprints or prints that you can match up and then say, yeah, this is an infringement.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.680]   Like, why would you not do that, especially with deep fakes coming up?
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.000]   Oh, it's going to be really.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.520]   Why would you not do that immediately?
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.560]   Like, why would you not be working on that with like MIT or, you know, something, something
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.520]   along those lines to say, okay, like we're going to protect against deep fakes by doing
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.160]   this thing on YouTube where, you know, if someone uploads an image of a person and they
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.560]   put in a copyright strike, like we're going to take it down.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   Was it.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:59.000]   In the complaint, he said, YouTube, like Google seems to rely on algorithms and no special
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.200]   effort requiring custom software employed quickly in these cases of criminal activity.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.240]   If a crime is being committed, you've got to be able to reach humans capable of stopping
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   it.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.880]   Apparently Google has no humans.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.360]   So I think that's.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.160]   But again, it depends on the kind of complaint you're making because for some reason, if a
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.960]   lawyer representing an artist contacts YouTube, those things are taken down immediately.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.120]   And they're often and the thing they're complaining about is almost always fair use.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120]   It's not.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   Someone has uploaded a song.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.840]   It's literally a musician talking about how they made the song or someone reviewing a movie
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.160]   or whatever it might be.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.720]   It's incredible.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.720]   Let's take a little break.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.160]   It's Paul Therat, the king of grumpy.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.560]   80s pop rock.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.800]   80s pop rock of white lion.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.600]   And he is, of course, the host of Windows weekly and fast ring.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   What is it?
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   Fast ring daily.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.920]   I get it wrong every time.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   First ring.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   First ring.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   It's first.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.720]   Thank you for remembering that there is one.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.600]   And of course, Therat.com is a great site.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.080]   And we see him every Wednesday right here.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:18.400]   Harry McCrack and the technologizer doing great stuff at Fast Company.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.320]   Are you going to be able to go in?
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.680]   You're not going to be able to go into places, are you?
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.680]   Not right now.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.680]   In terms of reporting.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.920]   Like that great eight tap story or the IBM.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.800]   I'm working in a big story right now for this fall that I will probably do entirely for
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.880]   my home office and on the phone and via zoom and so forth.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.000]   And it's doable, but it's not as fun.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   No.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.040]   But maybe if you're talking about hardware, it's less satisfying.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:50.640]   I have to say though, I'm really grateful to Fast Company that they are doing what my
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.080]   friend Steven Levy used to call slow journalism.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.920]   They're letting you do big pieces, big long long read.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.080]   I like that it said long read ahead of your articles.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.880]   Luckily for us kind of the more TLC we give stories, the better they tend to do.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880]   Good.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   That's really great.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   That's really great.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   It's good to have you.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.720]   It's fun to see Ashley, a sketha again, senior producer at CNET.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   Tell me about the videos you're doing over there.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.920]   Oh gosh, we're doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   So I recently did back in, I want to say April or May, we did the, we ranked just about
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.160]   every streaming service service.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160]   That was good.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.920]   And I've referred back to that over and over again.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.880]   That was really well done.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.880]   Thank you.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.680]   That was a couple of weeks of tearing my hair out and coming up with the scoring system.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.920]   It was, it was, but it was fun and I was really happy about it.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.040]   And then, you know, we're developing some new stuff, which is exciting.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.280]   I'm part of a kind of a move fast, break things.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   Nice.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.680]   Creative dev team.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.160]   We just had a series that I helped co-create a go live called Hacking the Apocalypse where
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:01.480]   the very excellent Claire Riley, which is one of my colleagues at CNET.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.800]   This is pre, before the germs came.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   She went out and traveled and learned about all kinds of things like how to survive different
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.720]   apocalyptic scenarios.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:19.200]   And so she went and visited nuclear bunkers and she got into a little pod that's designed
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.040]   to protect people from tsunamis.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.120]   She did all sorts of stuff.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.080]   She is absolutely amazing.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:32.600]   Kudos to her and Andy Altman and John Kim, who are the three main players who produced,
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:39.040]   edited, re-edited, like, I mean, they really went in there and made this thing sing.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.320]   And it's really exciting.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.960]   So we're all really proud of it.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.600]   So if you haven't seen it, you can check it out on CNET or YouTube and you can also,
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.960]   I believe we're airing it on Pluto TV right now.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   Oh, nice.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.960]   Pretty awesome.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   That's really great.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.120]   Yeah, this is a picture that you would put on your resume for the rest of your life.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.120]   Heck yeah.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.120]   Look at how cool she looks.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.120]   She's standing in front of the vault.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.200]   And she's just so great.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.080]   And the Strategic Air Command vault in the mountain.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.080]   I love that.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.080]   Yeah, she hosted.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080]   She's a bit of a Ramak in there.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.720]   She wrote just about everything.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.280]   I mean, she is just...
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.720]   I think the Ramak is running our nuclear system.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.200]   Wow, that's great.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.120]   Yeah, we're all very proud of it over at CNET.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.680]   And like I said, if you haven't seen it, it would be great if you watched it and validated
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.560]   my choices as a creative.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.640]   I would just appreciate that.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.120]   And also just giving them the credit that you do.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.040]   Because they really worked so hard on this.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:41.720]   My co-producer and I Logan in LA came up with this idea in March of last year.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.680]   So it's been a long time in production.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.240]   And then of course, when the pandemic had to kind of...
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.120]   There was some adjustments that that team had to make.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.920]   So they worked really hard.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.840]   And it really shows in the end product and we're really proud of it.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   Do you...
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.200]   If you look at some CBS come over and say, "Let me show you how to do TV, kid."
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.680]   Or do they give you a free hand?
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.640]   I tell everybody that because I went to school for television.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   I don't know what to do.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   It's your job, man.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   It's my job.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.280]   I know how to do this stuff.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   I will admit.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.280]   I will say this.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.800]   I will admit to being...
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.720]   So Logan kind of runs our YouTube channel.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.160]   He's our LA producer.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:25.080]   I am also producer in LA, but I'm mostly on air talent and like creative development
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.040]   and stuff.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.640]   So we come from film and TV backgrounds.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.680]   We had college for it.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.680]   Nice.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.760]   I interned at Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.280]   So when I came to CNET, there was a lot of news people in video.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:43.560]   And as opposed to now where you see a lot of teams, video teams, both on editorial and
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.920]   elsewhere are very much from the same backgrounds that Logan and I come from.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.160]   So we've had to...
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.160]   We are certainly guilty sometimes being a little bit of...
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160]   No, it all's.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.520]   It's like TV and film school snobs and being like, "Well, this is not how you do production
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   and film school."
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.120]   Like, so, yeah, that's totally us.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   And apologies to any of my coworkers who are annoyed by that on a regular basis.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   One more question.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.040]   Did Claire actually get to go into this prepper bunker?
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   Oh, man.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   I'm going to watch this.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   She has to visit.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   It's...
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.360]   I mean, these episodes are amazing.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.920]   She went to a cryogenics facility and this woman runs it.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.320]   She's part of the group team who runs it.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.720]   She's been to a cryogenics facility and there's a moment where they're interviewing and she
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.040]   walks up to one of these massive canisters that apparently hold four human bodies in
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.120]   them and she taps on it and she's like, "This is my husband."
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   Oh my God.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.920]   And she's like, "Hey, Frank."
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.960]   Like or whatever and it just wiles.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.120]   Like, I mean, it's really wiles.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.880]   I highly recommend this.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880]   I mean, like this series is...
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   Oh, this is Alcor.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   They've been doing this forever.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   I know Alcor.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   She goes, "Alcor."
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   She's like, "Hanging out there."
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   I mean, it is...
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.600]   I'm glad they're still around because, you know, if you got your body frozen by Alcor
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.600]   20 years ago, you know...
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.720]   You know, things are still going on, right?
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   You've been clawing out.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.360]   Yeah, you can be.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.000]   You know, so I'm glad to know they're still around.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   That's a canister for someone's head.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.440]   Oh yeah, because it's like if you just want your head frozen, you can do that.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.040]   That canister looks just like my spaghetti pot.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.440]   It looks just like an instant pot, which is very scary.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.720]   It looks like it's all clad limited spaghetti pot with a big...
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.480]   She talks about like some people are in here and some people have like...
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.640]   I think one person has a dog cryogenically frozen here.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.520]   You understand, this has to be kept frozen for at least a couple of thousand years from
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.000]   now because we are really far off.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.480]   We're pretty far off.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480]   Pretty far off.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.880]   I mean, you gotta have...
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.520]   I hope you have a good saving.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.920]   She's got faith.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.320]   This woman has faith.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.320]   She does.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.320]   Is Disney's head there?
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.320]   She's like, "Go and tap him."
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   Do they have Disney's head?
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.320]   I hope so, yeah.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.320]   Where's Walt Disney's cryogenically?
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.320]   They won't admit it.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   No one admits it.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320]   Yeah, it's all legend.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   No one will admit it.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   I was going to go to my favorite urban legend.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   Go ahead, Harry.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.920]   I was tempted to bring up Walt by the sighted against that, so I'm glad you did.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.680]   He was in that NC 57.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.160]   What's Walt Disney's head?
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160]   It just felled out.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   In my spaghetti pot.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.800]   They had to put it back in real fast, like the refrigerator.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.320]   They were just like, "We can only take it out for a second and then we gotta put it back."
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320]   We don't want her to thaw.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   Don't leave that thing open.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:12:00.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.

[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.320]   Don't want her to thaw out.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.320]   Let's see.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.320]   I think we did the -- there's nothing more to say about the Twitter hack.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:37.320]   We've been talking about that for a week and a half now.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.320]   I think it's over.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.320]   Twitter's earnings are out and they didn't have a very good border.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.320]   Add revenue down 23%.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   They missed expectations.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.320]   They didn't see growth in users.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:54.320]   But, man, I mean, your ad revenue down 23% doesn't bode well.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:57.320]   Oddly enough, the stock market rewarded the stock market.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.320]   They rewarded them with an increase of 4.1%.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.320]   The lot of -- what a Twitter subscription looked like.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.320]   That's one of the things I thought.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:10.320]   They're now saying it and Jack's admitting it because we had that story last week but it
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320]   was based solely on job postings.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.320]   But now Jack is saying, yeah, no, we're thinking of -- it's one of many things.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.320]   What would I be paying for?
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.320]   Premium features, right?
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.320]   Like, editing tweets.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.320]   I paid out of -- I would pay $5 the month to edit.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.320]   I would pay to edit tweets.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.320]   Within 60 seconds.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   Of tweeting it.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320]   Even just that.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.320]   A little short window of time.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.320]   Unsending an email.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:38.320]   I just have that feature where I can send it to tweets.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.320]   You don't like having people tell you about typos and tweets?
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.320]   I just hate when I do it and then I see the tweet immediately after I post it.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.320]   I'm like, I'm not going to copy this.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   By the time you do all that, some people have already seen it and retweeted it.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.320]   I'm just like, man, do I just let it live?
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.320]   That's why you can't edit it because it lives --
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.320]   Unsending it.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.320]   Like, would be -- I guess you have to delete it.
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:07.320]   But it's like -- I wouldn't mind being able to edit it within -- like, nobody can favorite
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   or retweet something for 30 seconds.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.320]   Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320]   I would pay to be able to upload longer videos.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:18.320]   I often want just a little bit more time than putting 40 seconds or whatever it is.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.320]   Premium features.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.320]   Interesting.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.320]   So maybe pay for longer tweets.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320]   No sponsored ads.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.320]   Like, that would be cool.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   Like, pretty nice.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.320]   Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   Ad-free Twitter experience.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320]   I'd pay for that.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   Can I just get rid of that entire third column?
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.320]   Whatever that is.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.320]   Because whatever you're recommending, I never want it.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320]   No.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320]   Sponsored.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320]   Yeah, I don't want that.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.320]   So, yeah, I'd be willing to pay for that.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:49.320]   Clearly, Twitter understands whose value in Twitter.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.320]   And the challenge is how do you extract that as Twitter?
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320]   How do you extract that value?
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.320]   Some other like the Tweet deck type stuff seems like it could be the business.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.320]   I would pay -- if they -- yeah.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.320]   Premium features are like power user features would be something I'd subscribe to.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.320]   An inline tweet delete feature.
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320]   Like, I'd pay a little extra.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.320]   Like, you pay tweet delete now.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:15.320]   If you want to delete old tweets, just get rid of them on a regular basis.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:20.320]   You know, I'd pay for that.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.320]   Like, I'd pay for an actual, you know, first party service.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:32.320]   I would -- you know, if I subscribed and had like a premium subscription that deleted my tweets on an interval that I chose.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.320]   Like, that would be nice.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.320]   There you go.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.320]   Well, we'll see.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320]   Oddly enough, the stock price went up.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   Although earnings were down.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.320]   We have a record of what happened last week on Twitch.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.320]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.320]   He got books.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.320]   You're really --
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320]   I have alien.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320]   He got a plant.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.320]   Oh, what?
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.320]   There.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.320]   I think she needs a boost.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.320]   That's Jeff Jarvis, by the way.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.320]   And interior decorator.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.320]   Tweet news.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.320]   And we're getting ready to sit back and enjoy some games.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.320]   These are going to be first party games.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320]   Xbox exclusives.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.320]   I don't know what to say.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320]   It looks just like --
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.320]   It looks just like --
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.320]   Hello.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:12.320]   I guess your franchise is like, "Hello, you don't want to change it too much."
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.320]   All about Android.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.320]   Joining us today, Dave Berg, who is a VP of engineering for Android at Google.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.320]   If desserts were still around, where would we be right now?
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.320]   It being, I believe, R?
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.320]   If you were asking an engineer on my team, what are they working on, they would say,
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.320]   RBC.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.320]   And so, RBC is red-belted cake.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.320]   Oh.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.320]   Oh.
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.320]   Windows Weekly.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:41.320]   The Slack has announced its filing, a complaint against Microsoft and the EU, because they don't
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:46.320]   like that Microsoft is, quote, "tying teams to Office 365."
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:53.320]   And they feel like that's blocking them from being chosen as a best of breeds technology.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:55.320]   The news that, "Oh, I guess we can't compete.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.320]   We're going to have to file an antitrust complaint."
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.320]   Might signal to potential customers, to potential investors that this company is not going to make it.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.320]   Tweet.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.320]   Friends don't let friends miss Twitter.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.320]   I do want to talk about the Slack thing, because you were irate, you were pissed, but we have
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.320]   to take a little break.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.320]   We'll come back also with our intel.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.320]   There's lots more.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.320]   R. Shudhay brought to you by LastPass.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.320]   Your IT department has a tough job right now.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   More devices, applications, people working from home.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.320]   New threats, new regulations, strong security, getting more complicated than ever.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320]   Thank goodness.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.320]   LastPass provides your IT department with strong security that's easy to use.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.320]   It's easy to use and manage.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:45.320]   LastPass lets you secure every entry point from shadow IT to apps to mobile and cloud services.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:50.320]   Their access solutions give you visibility and control over every access point to your organization.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.320]   You can unify access and authentication.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.320]   Employees access a variety of applications and devices, but that can lead to a lack of visibility.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:05.320]   You can't really see what your users are doing from application to application or device to device,
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.320]   unless you use LastPass.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:14.320]   LastPass identity offers a simple and integrated view across all access and authentication tests.
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.320]   IT will know who's accessing what, when, and where, and that's really important, especially
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.320]   with employees working from home.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.320]   The beauty part of LastPass is you get increased security without impacting productivity.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.320]   It doesn't slow down employees.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.320]   It doesn't hurt productivity.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:34.320]   It actually makes their job easier, so they're more likely to want to use it.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.320]   Single sign-on is an example.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.320]   It's so much better than Passwords makes it easy to sign-on.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   Employees love it, and yet it's more secure.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.320]   LastPass does the thing that's the hardest in security.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.320]   It makes it more secure and easier.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.320]   Of course, it's the best password manager out there.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.320]   Passwords are entryways into businesses.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.320]   You can't be using sticky notes and spreadsheets to keep track of them.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.320]   You need LastPass's secure vault, decrypted, and encrypted all the time.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.320]   It's encrypted only at the device level.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.320]   The password, the Master Passwords, never sent to LastPass.
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.320]   Only your employee knows it.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.320]   They don't store it.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.320]   It works on every device you've got, an iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.320]   Every browser known to man.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.320]   And your data is always secured with the strongest 256-bit AES encryption.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.320]   The same used by banks and the military.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.320]   It's as secure as you can get.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:36.320]   Protect your business and your IT department with the tools you need to keep your business safe with LastPass.

[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.320]   Find out how they can help you stay productive and secure.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.320]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.320]   Here we are in the beautiful LastPass studio.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.320]   I'm the only one here, but we thank you LastPass.
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.320]   You wrote us--
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.320]   They're in spirit.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.320]   They're here in spirit.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:06.320]   Speaking of the IBM-- deserted IBM facility, you wrote a piece Paul called the end of an era in Intel.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:12.320]   How long before we see a disused cafeteria with long chairs?
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.320]   I'm nervous about Intel.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.320]   This is a company that just actually posted stellar earnings.
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:25.320]   Businesses not quite equally split between PCs and data centers.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:31.320]   They literally fabricate their own chips, which has always been kind of a competitive advantage.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.320]   Oh, there's been a little drumbeat that they may stop doing that.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:40.320]   That's the story, which is Bob Swan during the post earnings conference call, which I missed.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.320]   I caught this late.
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:47.320]   Someone asked, would you consider outsourcing TSMC or whatever?
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.320]   He said, "Yeah, that's a contingency plan for sure."
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.320]   Because TSMC has a 7-millimeter process.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.320]   Oh, why don't we have six that are about to launch?
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.320]   It has five that are about to launch in the foreseeable future too.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.320]   Yeah, this is Intel for some reason.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.320]   They had trouble with 10, and now they're having trouble with seven.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.320]   They say we're not--
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.320]   They're still having trouble with 10, by the way.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.320]   They still haven't completed that transition.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.320]   Why is it important?
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.320]   You better explain this.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.320]   Why is that number important?
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320]   The nanometer number?
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.320]   It really speaks to the efficiency of the chips, and this is the problem.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:29.320]   So as computing has gone mobile for end users and data centers have gone to the cloud,
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   what we're looking for is that power providers, the power efficiency number.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:37.320]   Intel has always been-- they're the megahertz guys, right?
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:41.320]   I mean, they're really good at pumping up the power of individual chips.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:47.320]   They're not good at bringing them down to smaller die sizes and making them more efficient.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:50.320]   They're not essentially taking advantage of Moore's law.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.320]   Well, yeah, Moore's--
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320]   It's over.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.320]   Thanks, Intel.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:00.320]   Well, but it's not over for TSMC.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.320]   Well, Moore's law is a moving target.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   It's certainly changed over the years, but yes.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:16.320]   I mean, the problem is Intel is about to be subsumed by what is called an arm because I don't know what else to call this, but those types of chips are more efficient, and they are obviously not.
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:24.320]   They are obviously ideal for a data center, which is roughly half of Intel's business, and personal computing, of course, has gone mobile.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:31.320]   And off the top of my head, I mean, there are probably 10 times as many mobile devices as that was.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.320]   That's maybe an exaggeration.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:38.320]   Eight times as many mobile devices sold each year as PC, something like that.
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:45.320]   I don't think Intel's going to give up the PC any time soon, but they're going to be the last company standing there, and that's not the business you want to bet your future on.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:51.320]   I have been, you finally come around to my way of thinking, Paul, I've been beating this drum for a while.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:44:05.320]   Well, Leo, I have to disagree with you because, no, I look, the future, I really, I've long felt the future is open, you know, for one thing, and that's kind of maybe a software approach.
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:10.320]   But yeah, you can see what's happening out in the broader world with regards to personal computing.
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320]   I mean, it's not, you can't ignore it.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]   I mean, it's happening.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:18.320]   So Intel now says there's seven nanometer process, which is already delayed.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:25.320]   It's already more than a year behind won't be out till 2022 or 2023.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:29.320]   Yeah, by the way, that's Intel speak for 2024 2025.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:36.320]   So it's like, apparently the yields are not good for their process.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:46.320]   He says they identified a defect mode in its seven nanometer process that caused yield degradation issues.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:51.320]   Basically, they are just struggling at this point.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:59.320]   Now, admittedly, Apple banning Intel chips doesn't, it's a small fraction of their business, doesn't it affect them on how long?
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:11.320]   But I think that it is indicative, you know, Apple as a company that, well, look, they're concerned about control here, but that Apple is able to make this transition now is astonishing.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.320]   And I, you know, and they see the future.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320]   I mean, they're wrapped up in that future.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320]   They are very much a post PC company.
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.320]   Their devices business is much bigger than their Mac business.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:30.320]   So, you know, moving the Mac to Apple Silicon or on, you know, when armed type chips, that is a big news story.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.320]   Undoubtedly be a seven nanometer or less process.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:47.320]   No, this is, I mean, you know, in the windows world, we, we, we feel the pain of this particular announcement in a whole new level because, you know, we've been struggling with Windows 10 and I'm for a couple of years now.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.320]   But yeah, the world's changing.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:51.320]   There's no number.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.320]   Well, Sam and was talking about Intel a little bit.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:55.320]   We were talking about chips on the radio show.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320]   He's the car guy.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:04.320]   And he did point out that while Nvidia and other companies have done very well in automotive, Intel at least has an automotive play.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.320]   Perhaps.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320]   Okay.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.320]   Okay.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.320]   Do they?
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.320]   Do they?
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.320]   I don't know.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   I don't know.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:16.320]   Even in video, by the way, makes almost as much money from data centers as they do from graphics and PC and.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320]   That's right.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.320]   Their business, like Intel's, has gone in an interesting direction.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:29.320]   Well, that's why the big story is the rumor and it's only rumor that Nvidia is thinking of acquiring arms.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:32.320]   Softbank is either putting arm up for sale or something.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.320]   They need cash after their flop with we were.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.320]   I don't understand how Nvidia could afford it.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:41.320]   This is a company that I think they generated about three billion in revenue as a quarter.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320]   I mean, it's not.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:48.320]   There are probably only a few companies that could afford to buy arm that would want it.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320]   You know, Apple's not going to do it.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:53.320]   They could obviously I don't, Microsoft's not going to do it until.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:56.320]   I mean, you could make a case for Intel buying them.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320]   Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320]   You know.
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:03.320]   You quote an analyst, Chris Roland.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.320]   Yeah, that's a great quote.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.320]   Who says with the latest push out of process technology, we believe Intel has zero.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.320]   No chance.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.320]   That's by the way, the same.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:24.320]   Zero to no chance of catching or surpassing TSMC, at least for that next half decade, if ever.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.320]   This is the volume.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.320]   I don't have an exact number on Intel.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.320]   It's in the hundreds of millions.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:40.320]   But, you know, that's the difference between a business that ships primarily to what we'll call low volume markets data center slash PC versus PC.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.320]   Versus high volume markets in mobile.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.320]   Billions, you know.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.320]   Wow.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:54.320]   It's just a sad story for American manufacturing given that Intel is a great American manufacturing story for 50 years.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:03.320]   So, regardless of, I mean, it's very bittersweet for me, regardless of whether the devices that come out or better or worse or whatever.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.320]   It would be nice to see Intel flourishing.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:14.320]   And the air has been ending, I mean, at least ever since the smartphone became a big thing, and Intel tried to make smartphone processors and failed.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:22.320]   So, Harry, does AMD at least show that maybe x86 has some life left in it or?
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:27.320]   And then Intel is also dealing with AMD, which is resurgent and doing well.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.320]   So, it's not the even of meaningful competition in the PC area these days.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:39.320]   Yeah, I mean, I think, maybe doesn't make their own chips.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.320]   No, so I mean AMD, right?
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.320]   They must use to the TMSC or a TSMC.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.320]   They, they're manufacturing and became global foundries.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.320]   Oh, global foundries.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.320]   That's right.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.320]   I mean, Intel did this famous thing back in the late 70s or early 80s.
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:02.320]   At one point, they were doing a lot of memory chips and it was really successful for them for them, but they decided the future was not memory.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:10.320]   chips and they bet everything on microprocessors and shut down the memory stuff even when it was doing well.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:14.320]   And, you know, I kind of wonder is there like a big bet Intel could make today.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.320]   There would be the equivalent for that.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:21.320]   And part of it might be kind of acknowledging that the future is not being quite so vertically integrated.
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.320]   Actually, and this is a little scary.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.320]   AMD is fabbing a lot of its chips now at TSMC, not global foundries.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.320]   Okay.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:30.320]   That's right.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.320]   That's probably how they're hitting seven nanometer.
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:33.320]   Yeah, of course.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.320]   That's how they get it.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:36.320]   These guys know how to do it.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]   I've heard those people say, I don't know.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:47.320]   I think about this, that five and seven as described by TSMC isn't the same as five or seven described by Intel that their metrics are.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.320]   Yeah, they're talking about like no density and.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.320]   So they can't compare it.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.320]   I had to have really.
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.320]   You know, except we're going to compare it and.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.320]   Right.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:02.320]   It's like for.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:05.320]   Anyway, yeah.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320]   This looks bad.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.320]   This was a.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320]   Okay.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.320]   Harry, you're, you probably have your finger.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:16.320]   Maybe Ashley on the pulse of future technologies.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:19.320]   I saw this story in the Washington Post and I thought.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.320]   What the heck?
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:25.320]   It's a picture of the mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker at an announcement.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.320]   U.S.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:38.320]   and officials and scientists unveiled a plan on Thursday to pursue what they call one of the most important technological frontiers of the 21st century building a quantum Internet.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:52.320]   They had a professor from Chicago, University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and senior scientists at Argonne National Laboratory called the Internet Project a pillar of the nation's quantum research program.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.320]   It's a birth of a new technology.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.320]   Oh, and it will be by the way, hacker proof.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.320]   They say.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:03.320]   This all sounds really good until I got to the sentence.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:07.320]   Maybe you can explain this to me.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.320]   Maybe I'm just ignorant.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:16.320]   Quantum computers are still at an early stage of development.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:19.320]   Not yet as powerful as classical computers.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:26.320]   But connecting them via an Internet could help accelerate their use for solving complex problems.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.320]   The networks promise to be more secure.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:34.320]   Some even say unhackable because of hand waving here.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.320]   The nature of photons and other quantum bits known as qubits.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:48.320]   And my favorite part was when they said that devices on this quantum Internet will be able to talk to each other using some of the other.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:57.320]   Using something called quantum entanglement without being connected in any way.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:00.320]   What is that magic?
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:02.320]   I think that's magic.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.320]   They're not connected.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:07.320]   Clark's third law, but that aside.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.320]   It seems impossible.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:13.320]   Oh, and by the way, the reason it's not hackable.
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:18.320]   This is another good one.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.320]   The Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:26.320]   If you snoop on the traffic going on in the quantum network, it changes.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:30.320]   You can't hack it because you can't look at it.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:33.320]   It seems like a really raw idea right now.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:38.320]   Especially given the state of quantum computing in general.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:43.320]   It was a very raw idea back then.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:49.320]   It sounds like the notion for the quantum Internet is it would start as something for military applications and academia.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:56.320]   I think over the next few decades, it's a totally logical idea.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:02.320]   That article you mentioned, I think, also says that nobody is really sure who's going to pay for this right now.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:11.320]   We know that the energy department is investing $500 to $700 million a year with more to come.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:15.320]   It's my guess that these guys are going, yeah.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.320]   We can invent this.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.320]   Give us some more money.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:23.320]   I'm not entirely clear why you couldn't connect quantum computers over the Internet more or less as we know it.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:31.320]   I think that would be more secure, just given that the ability of quantum computers to do encryption at a level with that classical computers can't do.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:40.320]   Maybe it's the Washington Post and it's a difficult reporting and I'd love to know more and I was hoping somebody would explain it to me.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:45.320]   For instance, they say that they've built a 52-mile quantum network.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:50.320]   That's going to extend 80 miles and then in New York there's an 80-mile quantum network.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:54:00.320]   At the very next paragraph, they say a key piece of hardware, called a quantum repeater, still needs to be developed, invented to amplify the signal over long enough.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:09.320]   It's my guess they've got quantum computers over a standard network, not a quantum network because they don't have a repeater yet.
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:18.320]   Harry, where this is stuff that's decades away, I would imagine.
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:29.320]   I think my biggest concern is if you really want to make things a little more hacker-proof, sponsor encryption bills.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:30.320]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320]   I have a sponsor encryption bill.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320]   There you go.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:38.320]   We have existing technology that can help keep hackers out of things.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.320]   Sponsor encryption bills, be pro encryption.
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.320]   But I'm that same note.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:57.320]   I think the thing that I also have concerns about or that I would have concerns about whenever this happens is when we originally developed the Internet,
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.320]   it didn't exist before.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:10.320]   Now we're talking about two different kinds of Internet and it seems like one will be maybe a little harder to access for people of lower income,
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:15.320]   people of lower means, people in more rural areas.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:23.320]   The thing is now you're creating two different classes of information available to people.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:26.320]   I have a problem with that.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.320]   The whole idea, everything else aside, of a second Internet defeats the purpose of the Internet.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.320]   The Internet.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.320]   So I don't know.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.320]   I mean, it's like great, cool quantum computing.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.320]   I'm all about that.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.320]   Let's move forward.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.320]   I love progress.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.320]   But I was tweeting about it this morning.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:56:02.320]   I get very frustrated when I read about technology or computer science programming or any startup that does not consider the worst intentions of the worst people when they build products.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.320]   They think, oh, it's going to be great.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.320]   Like pie in the sky, like, oh, this is going to be hacker proof.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:09.320]   It's going to be hacker proof.
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:18.320]   It's here are all the great things it's going to do.
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.320]   And they don't consider how that can be weaponized to exclude groups of people to give disinformation to group people.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.320]   Yeah, it's all about the tick.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.320]   Will there be tick talk on this?
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.320]   Are we going to get a weaponized tick talk?
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.320]   Is there going to be a tick talk?
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:38.320]   But it's like, that's the thing that really frustrates me is it's like, yeah, you're talking about creating two different Internet and you think that's not going to affect a group of people, whoever it may be, that will not have it.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:40.320]   It absolutely will.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:56.320]   And these companies just, you know, we have this issue in computer science where we just, that is not, that is not constantly hammered into a curriculum either in a learning institution or outside of a learning institution in private companies.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.320]   There is, there's ethical ramification to the product that you build.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:02.320]   And you have to really think about these things.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:15.320]   And you have to, you know, not to say, always think like an evil person, but it's like, there are people out there who want to use products, whether it's tech or analog products to do bad things.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:19.320]   And you have to consider those use cases when you are building this stuff.
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:21.320]   Thank you.
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.320]   Good.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:28.320]   And I don't want to dash cold water on this exciting idea of the magic.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.320]   I can do it.
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:31.320]   You don't want to put cold water?
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:33.320]   You want to put cold water all over the protons?
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.320]   No.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:39.320]   It could very well be that this article is just the person who wrote it, didn't have any idea.
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:42.320]   Nobody has any idea what they're talking about when it comes to quantum.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:44.320]   It strikes me that nobody does.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.320]   That's not a slightly talking about.
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:49.320]   Yeah, it's just, it almost doesn't exist, basically.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:52.320]   I mean, a couple of years ago, Microsoft.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:53.320]   There are quantum computers.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:56.320]   No, I know there are milestones are reached.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.320]   There are announcements that are made.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:03.720]   You know, I went through a, you know, through some presentation that Microsoft had a few
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:10.200]   years ago, had a half an hour meeting with those guys, sat down, started writing my article.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:14.000]   Everything you need to know about quantum computing was the title and the first sentence
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.320]   said, "Is an article I would love to write, but I have no idea what they're talking about."
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:25.320]   You know, and it's just, it's, it's beyond me.
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:28.320]   I just, I literally don't understand it.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:29.320]   Okay.
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:36.600]   Well, I, you know, maybe I'm just, I'm being left behind by the magic of computers and
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:42.280]   the cubits without being connected and hackers that can't see information because it changes
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.240]   the minute they see it.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:50.320]   Magic of the Cubits is definitely going to be the name of my next synthesizer project,
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.320]   right?
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.520]   The magic of the cubits.
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.320]   The dance of the cubits.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.560]   My new, that's also my new Xbox game.
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.920]   It's my new Xbox series, Xbox game.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.320]   Magic of the Cubits.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:02.320]   All right.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.320]   We got some stories.
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:04.320]   I want to talk about streaming.
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:05.320]   Peacock is out.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:08.480]   I want to see if you want to update your streaming reviews.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:13.400]   Ashley Ischetha is here from CNET, senior producer over there.
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:19.040]   Paul Therat from windowsweeklyandtherat.com and the technologyizer, Harry McCracken.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.440]   This portion of the show brought to you by Zen desk.
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.360]   You use a Zen desk.
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.360]   You are already a Zen desk user.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:31.280]   You just don't know it because so many of the biggest companies in the world use Zen
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:39.480]   desk to improve customer relations for remote support to, to keep customers happy.
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:43.680]   Some of the biggest companies in the world use Zen desk.
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.840]   Some things are a little weird right now.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.400]   Admit it.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.960]   It could be hard to keep up with what matters most to your business.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:54.600]   The answer is always customers.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.360]   Zen desk is here to help.
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:02.760]   Right now they're offering, I love this, a six month absolutely free remote support bundle.
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:07.520]   All the essential tools your team needs to stay agile, keep connected with customers
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:13.240]   via whatever way customers want to communicate email, phone, chat, community forum, help center,
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.240]   social media.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.120]   You'll set it up in hours, not weeks.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:22.240]   You get it up and running and it's free for six months.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:26.240]   Just to help you right now when you need it most, Zen desk was created with a simple
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.240]   idea.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:31.840]   Make customer service software that's easy to use and accessible to everyone with a single
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.920]   dynamic help desk interface.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.280]   It's easy and quick to implement, but it's very flexible so it will change as your needs
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:40.560]   change.
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:45.880]   Use it right out of the box, configure it to your exact needs with apps or integrations.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.120]   It's used by every company in every size from startups to large enterprises.
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:54.760]   The beauty of Zen desk is if you're a small startup, it will scale with your growth to
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:59.040]   make sure the powerful innovative customer experiences are within reach no matter how
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.360]   big or small your company is.
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:05.400]   No matter what industry, no matter what your ambition.
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.520]   The director of client facing experience in analytics at home bridge, they use Zen desk.
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:14.640]   One chap says, having all the customer data in a single place helps us to achieve a high
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.040]   and consistent level of customer satisfaction.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:22.400]   We can collaborate better and we have the visibility to see and report on everything.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:28.280]   Zen desk also improves security by allowing us to control access to sensitive content.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:34.600]   So Zen desk is a complete suite of tools and I love it free for six months, free for six
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:35.600]   months.
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.560]   The remote support bundle works nearly everywhere.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.840]   They have more than 150,000 customers across hundreds of industries and over 30 languages.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.280]   As I said, you've used Zen desk.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:47.600]   You may not know it, but you have.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.720]   The customer journey differs for every company, for every business, for every industry.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:57.920]   No matter what you need, Zen desk products are flexible enough to have a solution for
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:58.920]   you.
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:02.320]   They can pave the path that's best for your organization.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.680]   Customers come first and when customers come first, Zen desk is right there for you.
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:12.920]   Zendesk.com/twit gets started with that six month remote support bundle, absolutely free.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:16.000]   That's the best offer we have.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:24.360]   Z-E-N-D-E-S-K.com/twit-Zen desk helps you change with the times.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.480]   Space force, not the Netflix TV show.
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:30.840]   The actual space force logo is here.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.120]   It does not look as much like the Star Trek logo as it did.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:42.120]   It probably took some feedback, but they do have a motto, "Semper Supra."
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.400]   Which doesn't mean we're always driving Toyotas.
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:46.400]   It means always...
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.600]   And we're the Supra.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:50.160]   Semper the Supra.
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:56.840]   It harks back, of course, to the Marine course, Logan Semper Paratus, always prepared.
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:59.000]   Or is that the Boy Scout motto?
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.080]   I can never remember.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.960]   Semper Supra means always above.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.200]   Because they're always above.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.480]   They're always up there.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.480]   Space force.
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.000]   Personal Z-net stuff.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]   Yep.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.600]   I just thought I'd pass it along.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:21.240]   TechCrunch says that the original space force logo revealed in January, which looks like the
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:27.160]   Starfleet's logo, is actually the seal for the space force branch of the military.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:32.440]   They say this new logo is the simpler one for the organization as a whole.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:36.800]   They say you could tell them apart because this one looks more like the Pontiac logo.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:37.800]   Nice.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.240]   Well, they're not using it anymore.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.240]   It's okay.
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.240]   No, no, this is the one they're using.
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:43.240]   The Pontiac logo.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:44.400]   No, I mean Pontiac, they're not using it.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:45.400]   Oh, that's right.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:46.400]   They don't need it.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:47.400]   So, yeah, why not?
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:48.400]   Keep it alive.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.040]   Just make it red, it'll be perfect.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:04:00.560]   That stays the day that the Teddy Bear picnic on Capitol Hill, Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook,
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:06.960]   Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai will gather to testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:08.560]   I hope they stream that live.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:14.160]   Do you think they're going to break out into a four-way flailing fight thing where they
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.160]   just...
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.160]   Yeah, you got to.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.400]   You got to be a nut job.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:23.040]   I always look forward to it because it's always so much fun to hear senators who have no
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.040]   idea what they're talking about.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.040]   Sure.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:29.720]   Actually, it's the House, but they're equally clueless.
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.720]   So, help me again.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:32.720]   How do I post on TikTok?
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:33.720]   Yeah, it'll be fun.
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:37.200]   I'm trying to attach something in an email message, Mr. Zuckerberg.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.200]   Yes, it's something that you can help me with.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.200]   Can you help me with that?
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.200]   That'll be fun.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.840]   My granddaughter says...
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.840]   Yes.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:44.840]   That's the...
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.160]   Can you help set up my printer?
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.160]   Like, that's...
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.800]   I mean, it's that.
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.400]   How can I tell which videos on TikTok are from the Chinese government?
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.400]   Oh, Lord.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:57.440]   But they did get them.
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:58.440]   They got them all.
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.960]   The big four, they're showing up.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:01.560]   That should be fun.
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:06.200]   I think you should get this chair, Ashley, for your woman cave.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:12.960]   The Herman Miller X Logitech Gaming Chair, a mere $1,500.
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.120]   It glows, apparently.
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.120]   I got to start a GoFundMe.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.120]   I've been used to go...
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:20.120]   I'm starting to start the GoFundMe.
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:21.120]   I'm desperate.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.120]   I need to start my back.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.120]   I need to chair.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.120]   20 years.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:25.120]   And at last...
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:26.120]   It was designed...
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:28.160]   It's called the Embody Gaming Chair.
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:30.640]   It was designed with help from 30 physicians.
[02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:32.640]   I don't know why 30.
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:33.640]   Like...
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.640]   I feel like you could be in that...
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:39.800]   I don't know if you're gonna have your 30 of the opinion.
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:41.280]   I love a good 30 of the opinions.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.840]   There are 30 people.
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:49.320]   Who's padding with copper-infused particles designed to cool off the body and pixelated
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:54.240]   support, which helps more evenly distribute the sitter's weight.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:56.880]   If it's a gamer, it's probably a considerable...
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.440]   It's a Cheetos bag that attaches to the side of the Cheetahs holder.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:03.080]   Kind of a trough that you can swing over.
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.000]   A cup holder would be nice.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.960]   Oh, gotta have a cup holder.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.960]   Be good.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:12.080]   Gotta have a cup holder.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:16.080]   The US Army, not gonna be on Twitch.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.320]   There's still upset about mixer.
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:20.320]   Yeah, right.
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:23.200]   Yeah, there's said very, very upset.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.200]   There was...
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:25.200]   I didn't know this.
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:29.040]   A recruitment-oriented Twitch channel.
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.760]   Of course, it's Twitch.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:35.280]   So immediately people go in the chat room and ask, "Can I participate in war crimes?
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.840]   Is that part of the deal?"
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:43.080]   I'm sorry, and we're worried about TikTok because of some kind of Chinese government thing.
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.520]   They're just jealous they didn't think of it first, right?
[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:46.720]   Like, that's what it is.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:50.120]   They're mad because it doesn't belong to our government.
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.120]   Yeah.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:53.120]   That's what they're mad about TikTok.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.600]   Why didn't we think of that first?
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:03.080]   Esports consultant and journalist Rod the slasher Breslowe said, "Due to recent media coverage
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:09.800]   of fake giveaways and potentially unconstitutional bans, the US Army esports team has paused social
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:15.080]   activities streaming on Twitch and official activations with Twitch, including participating
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.440]   and upcoming Twitch rivals events."
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.800]   But the trick that I learned, the Army has been esports.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:22.400]   I didn't know that.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.400]   Didn't know.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:29.000]   They're not gonna resume any contact with humans until spring 2021.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000]   So...
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.480]   Just like the rest of us.
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:32.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:39.680]   A CRISPR cow was born.
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:49.520]   The sign has spent years editing a sex determining gene into bovine embryos.
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:51.720]   We can now tell you the story in April.
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:57.320]   Cosmo arrived, and he's definitely a boy.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:02.440]   I have great news for anybody who wants a boy.
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:05.120]   I have a big cow.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:09.720]   You can in fact do that without gene editing.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:11.720]   Gene Spicer, yeah.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:12.720]   Yeah.
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:13.720]   Yeah.
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:15.640]   Might save you a couple bucks.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:19.360]   Just you can have that information for anybody out there looking.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:22.800]   Now, if you got a quantum cow that I want to hear about.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:23.800]   Cubic cow?
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:24.800]   Oh boy.
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:29.960]   Cubic cow could be in two places at once.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:34.200]   No peacock, 1.6 million downloads in the first week.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.520]   1.5 million.
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.440]   Those are cute.
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:39.720]   Yeah, those are quibby numbers.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:41.280]   M's quibby numbers.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.440]   It is free, right?
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.760]   Although there are paid tiers to give you various other things like no ads.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:53.040]   Quibby got 1.2 million installs in the first week.
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:55.320]   So it's a little bit better than Quibby.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:59.000]   I think morbid curiosity was the Quibby thing, right?
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.800]   And also peacock is missing a few things that are, you know, you would expect to see if
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.600]   you were downloading an NBC Universal Streaming Service.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:11.400]   So if you download it, you're not going to see Seinfeld and you're not going to see friends
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:12.400]   for a little while.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.400]   So yeah, there's a bunch of licensing.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.800]   So we'll tell you all over the place.
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:18.560]   What is the deal with peacock?
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:21.800]   Disney+ didn't get 12 million downloads in the first week.
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:24.840]   So that's, you know, baby Yoda.
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:26.240]   Baby Yoda.
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.520]   That's people I think people were really curious about that.
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.800]   So I mean, Disney+ is a very specific use case.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.680]   And I think a lot of people were ready for that streaming service that was like family
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:37.680]   oriented.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:40.680]   Like they've really kind of cornered the market on that.
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:44.800]   Now one of the things you covered in your reviews is of course availability on various
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:46.840]   streaming platforms, right?
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:47.840]   Yes.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.080]   And what I didn't realize, you just assume, well, it's not going to be on road.
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:53.960]   It's everywhere.
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:54.960]   Not so.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:55.960]   Nope.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:56.960]   No.
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:57.960]   Not Amazon fire.
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:58.960]   No Amazon.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:09:59.960]   No Ruku.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:00.960]   No Kukuk.
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:05.440]   Peacock also has some weird problems with like not working over HDMI and a friend of mine
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.840]   couldn't get it to work on his monitor and some of the peacock technical advice kind of
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:16.120]   said like, well, watch it on some device other than your desktop PC.
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:17.280]   If it doesn't work for you.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:18.280]   Oh, great.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:19.280]   I had this.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:25.120]   So when I was filming, we did an app walkthrough of the Peacock app for CNET's YouTube channel.
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:30.720]   And when I was filming it, I was doing it on my PC using my Elgato capture and you
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.440]   know, everything was fine until I actually wanted to play any content or I went to the
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:43.080]   channels tab, which is like live, live channels, which are not necessarily like your traditional
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:44.080]   channels.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.320]   They were like, oh, it's a channel for the tonight show or the today show or whatever.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:50.840]   We're just constantly playing episodes.
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:52.120]   But I went to that on the IH.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.320]   I think it HDCP right is like preventing a couple of you know, we don't want you to capture
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:58.320]   this stuff.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:04.840]   So I, yeah, I really struggle watching that stuff on my, on my desktop, which is good.
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:07.720]   There's some, there's some issues there, which is not great.
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:10.320]   So is this just birth pangs or is it going to clear up?
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.320]   For instance, are they HBO Max and P.H. are they going to be able to make a deal with
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:17.920]   Roku at some point or who and what's the problem?
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:18.920]   Is it money?
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:20.520]   Yeah, they have to.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:21.520]   They have to compete.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:22.520]   I mean, that's that is.
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:24.600]   Is Roku what a big chunk of their revenue?
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:25.600]   Is that why?
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:32.920]   I, I, you know, I could not begin to speculate as to why NBC Universal was like, I don't
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:39.280]   think two of the bigger set top boxes are good ideas because obviously they're giving a,
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.520]   a cut to Apple.
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:42.800]   It's on Apple TV.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.560]   So right 30%, right?
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.120]   Yeah, I really can't.
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:51.480]   I can't imagine why they thought it was a good idea to launch without support for, especially
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:58.240]   those two devices, especially like Roku and Apple Fire TV, which tons of people have and
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:01.120]   prefer over Apple TV, for example.
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.760]   And so it is, it is a little short sighted, I guess.
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:09.720]   Like, I'm, I'm sure maybe, I'm sure it probably has something to do with the fact that there's
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:15.360]   like, you know, lawyers involved in negotiating and deal like, I'm sure there's something going
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.560]   on there that I'm just not privy to.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.480]   Disney did everything right.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.480]   These other guys have done everything right so far.
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.080]   I think part of it's really hard to do everything right.
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.840]   And Disney really kind of bet the company on this in a way that these other companies
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.320]   are not doing so far.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.480]   Well, good for, you know, that just shows you.
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:40.800]   Like, I would imagine that 1.6 million downloads would be, I don't know, maybe triple that
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.600]   had they launched on two of the other biggest platforms.
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:47.800]   Like, it seems like a, it seems like a big misstep for launch.
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:52.560]   But, you know, people who are into, people who are streaming are not reading these articles,
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.560]   right?
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.560]   This is like very inside baseball.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:58.640]   They don't care about how peacocks doing, they'll just go download it whenever they are,
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:01.600]   whenever they remember it exists or it is in their face.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:03.400]   And then they go, oh yeah, I'm just going to use this.
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:07.320]   Like, I don't think this number will affect anybody's willingness to download it in the
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.320]   future.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.000]   Mostly, at least if I'm, I use myself as an example, it just comes down to, is there
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.200]   a show I want to watch?
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:14.200]   Right.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.200]   I want to watch it.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.200]   What do I need to watch it?
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:17.760]   Oh, I need peacock.
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:21.760]   And then I'll download it and install it and maybe even pay for it if I don't want to
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:22.760]   watch the ads.
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:26.680]   Yeah, I do think it is very smart that they launched with a free option.
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:27.680]   Yeah.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:28.680]   That is good.
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:32.880]   That is brilliant on their part because it gets, yeah, it gets everybody into that ecosystem,
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.880]   right?
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:38.000]   And then you have, and then they launch originals, they have some originals, but obviously with
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.640]   the pandemic, they weren't able to finish a lot of production on some of the later,
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:44.240]   produced shows.
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:47.480]   So they'll have more originals next year.
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:53.360]   And as time goes on, you're going to see them once those licensing agreements end with
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:59.560]   Netflix or wherever they might have them with, they are absolutely going to start keeping
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:03.520]   exclusives on their properties in, in app.
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:07.920]   So it's over time, there's just going to be more and more reasons to be a subscriber
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:15.360]   to peacock, whether that's on the free level or to pay for a little more content and a
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:21.080]   little more content and ads or you go to the top tier, which is 10 bucks a month and it's
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:26.920]   no ads, but they actually have an asterisk there where it says actually there will be
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:31.200]   some stuff because of agreements we have with other production companies that there
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.480]   has to be ads on them for the time being.
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:37.600]   So you may see a couple of ads here or there, but generally speaking, it'll be a no ad
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:38.600]   experience.
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:43.600]   At this point for the consumer, it feels like a Jenga game where we're just taking one
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:46.280]   adding one more brick, adding one.
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:47.280]   Too many.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.280]   I'm just waiting services.
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.320]   Like they keep adding these and I feel like at any minute, the whole thing's just going
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:52.960]   to crash to the ground.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.800]   Well, this is what we asked for, right?
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:56.600]   Like I, it's a be careful what you wish for.
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:57.600]   Is this what we asked for?
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:58.600]   Is it really?
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.680]   Yeah, because if you think about it back in, let's say back in the 90s, early 2000s when
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:09.000]   everybody was paying ridiculous amounts of money for cable bundles, it became, well,
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.200]   why can't I just buy this channel?
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:12.880]   Why can't I just buy this channel?
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:14.120]   Why can't I just pay for this?
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:17.360]   Well, to be fair, what we really wanted is why can't I just buy this show?
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:18.360]   We want a complete desegregation.
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:19.360]   Right.
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:20.360]   And you can do that.
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:21.360]   That's the thing.
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:22.360]   You can do that.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.200]   It's your $35 and buy your show for a season.
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.200]   Right.
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.120]   But most people would rather have this subscription where you have access to more stuff.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:32.520]   And this is what people thought they wanted.
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:36.960]   And now we're seeing kind of a return to a bundle, these like sort of skinny bundle
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.360]   systems, like you have your phylos where it's like, well, if you don't like this, this
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.760]   is actually worse than cable TV though, right?
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:48.320]   Because at least a cable TV, you had too much to watch, but it was all in one interface.
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:51.280]   Now there's too much to watch, but they're all in different apps.
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:54.000]   You have to figure out which way to switch between shows on different apps.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.280]   You have to manually switch out, load the other way till it comes up, choose the profile,
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:03.440]   and you know, it's so fragmented and confusing.
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:09.680]   Like Ashley said, you don't know what the deals are with people.
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:12.880]   You know, if I want to watch Seinfeld, where is Seinfeld this week?
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:14.680]   Was it on Netflix for a while?
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:19.120]   Isn't it on HBO or something?
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:20.800]   Why do I need to know stuff like that?
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:21.800]   It's crazy.
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:24.080]   You shouldn't have to know those things.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:27.800]   You shouldn't have to look up those things to be able to watch things that you like.
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.400]   You'll just search for something and say, "Here you go, here's where it is."
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:32.600]   When did TV become a career?
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:38.240]   You know, like I need to do research to figure out, you know, not just what we're watching,
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.240]   but where it is.
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:44.760]   My colleague, Jared Newman, just recently did a good story on services like RealGood,
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:48.760]   which are trying to solve some of that by essentially being like a portal where they'll
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:52.400]   tell you where Seinfeld is and direct you there.
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:57.360]   And RealGood kind of becomes your hub and the other things are more like satellite
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.360]   services.
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:16:59.360]   You're stopping pulling right.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.360]   I mean, Apple's trying to do this with Apple TV.
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:02.360]   Apple is doing it.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:03.360]   Apple is doing it.
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:04.360]   I'm not sure.
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:05.360]   Apple doesn't have Netflix.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:06.360]   They're not terrible.
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:07.360]   But it doesn't include Netflix.
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:09.360]   So that's kind of a big gap.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:10.360]   Well, that's the thing.
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:11.360]   Right.
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:12.360]   There's always going to be this kind of problem.
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:13.360]   It's so...
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.600]   You have to have these services connected to whatever it is that you want it to give you
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:18.600]   search results for.
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:22.080]   And some of these companies are like, "No, we don't need that.
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:23.360]   Just come over and open our app."
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.840]   Are you going to redo your channels, your streaming review?
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:28.840]   I want to do it every year.
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:30.440]   Yeah, you got to do it every year.
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:31.440]   Change is constant.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:37.680]   I did score Peacock early because it was in soft launch at the time.
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:40.440]   What do you think?
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:41.800]   You like it?
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:42.800]   I like it.
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.680]   I think the categories it offers.
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:49.840]   I think some people are really turned off by them because they're extremely specific
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:54.000]   and niche, kind of like those really weird Netflix categories.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.160]   But I am very curious.
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:03.320]   I think for me, over time, that trending tab, which is a very interesting and eclectic
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.760]   mix of, "Here's a three minute news clip of the day.
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:08.720]   Here's a show you might like.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:09.720]   Here's this.
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:10.720]   Here's this."
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:11.720]   I like that a lot.
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:16.600]   And I think that that's a really interesting concept that we haven't really seen on a streaming
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:19.760]   platform that's as big as Peacock.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:26.720]   And I think if you can offer that and really curate it well, and as we talked about earlier,
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:35.640]   use the algorithm, use an algorithm to understand who your viewer is and really serve them,
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.280]   that is a very compelling thing for me.
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:40.120]   And I mean, I have an account.
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:42.480]   So they got me to buy in at least on a free account.
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.480]   So for now, I'll probably keep it free.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:49.720]   I don't think I'm going to pay for the upgraded stuff, the upgraded accounts.
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:51.080]   But you know who knows?
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:57.040]   Maybe next year they'll have some award worthy show that everyone's talking about.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.760]   It's a buzzworthy thing.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:03.360]   And you don't want to have your FOMO and you got to subscribe and everybody needs to get
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:04.360]   in on it.
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:06.200]   So yeah, we'll see.
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:07.440]   I think it's very interesting.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:10.080]   But yes, I do want to do the rankings every year.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:16.040]   And also, I would like to formally and publicly apologize once again to the WWE Network, which
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:21.280]   I think is the only streaming service I accidentally omitted from that list.
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:25.120]   Who knew they had a network?
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.400]   I literally agreed.
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:27.400]   They emailed me.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:29.240]   I was waiting for an email from them.
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:33.280]   As soon as it went live, like first two comments, like we're both WWE Network and I'm like,
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:36.040]   oh my God, I had nightmares about this two nights before it published.
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:38.120]   Is it all wrestling all the time?
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:40.440]   It's all it's wrestling content.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:41.760]   So it's not necessarily match.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:42.760]   Wrestling related.
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:47.200]   Classic, wrestling related reality TV, stuff like that.
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:48.880]   Yeah, I felt really terrible.
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:51.600]   It's the only place to stream SummerSlam 2020.
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.600]   Man, you know me and I was like, I am so sorry.
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:59.640]   I will literally allow a wrestler to throw me through a table next year.
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:00.640]   Oh, please.
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.680]   Once we're all allowed to be in the same room, we can do it on camera.
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:04.200]   It'll be hilarious.
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:06.200]   So look for that in the next stream.
[02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:07.880]   Hey, at least it's on Roku.
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:10.080]   Yeah, it's available on Roku.
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:11.080]   So there you go.
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:12.640]   That has that going forward over Peacock.
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:16.360]   But yeah, again, I just felt so bad.
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:19.120]   And so many people love wrestling and I just felt I felt terrible.
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:23.080]   I had so many co-workers look over that list and I'm like, did I miss anything?
[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:26.960]   And there were a hundred services on there and everyone's like, this looks great.
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:27.960]   That's impossible.
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:32.880]   And nobody caught it, which just drives me crazy, especially considering we have wrestling
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:33.880]   fans.
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:39.080]   Well, you just gave them a big ass plug worth many thousands of dollars on Twitter.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:40.600]   I'm just so sorry.
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:44.280]   And we have many wrestling fans watching the show.
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:46.560]   Ashley, a Sketha, you did pretty good.
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:48.560]   Ninety nine out of a hundred ain't bad.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:52.120]   Man, but you want that hundred out of a hundred.
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:57.080]   Senior producer at CNET, she's Ashley, Ashley, a Sketha on the Twitter.
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.160]   So nice to see you.
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:59.280]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:01.000]   We really appreciate it.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000]   Always a pleasure.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000]   You're great.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000]   You know, what else is great?
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:07.400]   My friend, Harry, I miss when you and Marie would come up here.
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:08.400]   We could hang.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:09.400]   Sunday.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:11.400]   It's so sad.
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:13.000]   Well, 2021, maybe.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000]   Yeah, maybe next year.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.520]   He is the technology editor of Fast Company doing those great long form pieces.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:20.920]   You got to read the A-Tap story.
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:24.160]   And I can't wait to read the one you're working on now.
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:25.560]   Thank you, Harry, for being here.
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:26.720]   Give my love to Marie.
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:28.800]   Yeah, totally.
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:30.960]   And Mr. Paul Therat.
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:34.800]   He is our cocktail mister on Windows Weekly.
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:36.360]   Actually, his wife Stephanie is.
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:37.720]   That's why I was going to say that's my wife.
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:44.960]   And the king of Windows commentary, his book, The Field Guide to Windows 10 is available
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:45.960]   at leanpub.com.
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:49.440]   And of course, his blog, his website, it's not a blog.
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.040]   It seems like it's a demeanive thing.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.920]   It's like calling this a podcast.
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:54.680]   I'm a piece with it.
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:55.680]   All right.
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:57.760]   His site is mailing it in, Leo.
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:58.760]   It's a blog.
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.760]   It's a blog.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:00.760]   It's a blog.
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:01.760]   And Therat.com, T-H-U-R-R-O-T-T.
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:04.680]   Sometime we'll have a quantum internet.
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:05.680]   You won't have to mail it anymore.
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:06.680]   That's right.
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:07.680]   You know, do you just think about it a little bit?
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:09.920]   I could be there and vacationing at the same time.
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:11.880]   So awesome.
[02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:13.160]   So awesome.
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:19.440]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.320]   You can watch us do it live.
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:25.080]   You know, kind of a behind the scenes video at twitter.tv/live.
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:27.480]   Actually, it's video and audio.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:31.000]   But we make on demand versions nicely edited, cleaned up.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.520]   All the swear words removed.
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.040]   That's available on the website, twitter.tv.
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.320]   There's a YouTube channel.
[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:42.280]   And of course, the best way to get yourself a podcast application and subscribe.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:47.560]   That way you'll get it the minute it's available each and every Sunday night for your Monday
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:53.240]   morning commute from the living room to the bedroom and back.
[02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:55.240]   It's a short--
[02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:56.240]   It's so depressing.
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:57.240]   It's so depressing.
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:58.240]   Way to bring the room down.
[02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:00.240]   It's saving a lot on gas though.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.240]   Yeah.
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:02.640]   Just thinking about that, huh?
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:05.000]   I went to the gas station for the first time since April.
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.800]   I filled it up.
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:09.800]   And that's it.
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:11.040]   That's the whole story.
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:12.040]   It's a short story.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:14.520]   See you next year, practically.
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:17.040]   It's a two mile drive to work.
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:21.320]   I do come in twice a week, but still, I'm more than that three, four times a week.
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:22.320]   Yeah.
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:24.120]   Eight miles a week.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:25.120]   Thanks everybody.
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:26.120]   Have a wonderful week.
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:27.880]   Stay safe, stay healthy, and we'll see you next time.
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:29.680]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:30.680]   Bye-bye.
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:39.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:24:00.300]   [ Pause ]
