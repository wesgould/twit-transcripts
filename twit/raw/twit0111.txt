[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.680]   Hello.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.240]   Mahalo to you.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.000]   Mahalo.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.680]   That means thank you.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.280]   It's kind of funny.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.080]   It's the first time you've been on since you've been of Mahalo.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.960]   No, that's not true.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.000]   Well, I was on that one time.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.360]   Was that right after I left CNA?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.920]   It might have been.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.080]   Just you hadn't left yet, but you'd announced it.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.520]   OK.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.000]   So it's kind of fun to say, how's it going at Mahalo?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.800]   It's going really well.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.320]   We've been doing a lot of shooting.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.160]   And we're getting everything going for our September launch.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.200]   Yeah, because we're waiting for the new Veronica Belmont show.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.680]   Where is it?

[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.280]   I had to go back east for a while for some vacation,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240]   so work up, put off for a little bit for family stuff.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.520]   I saw the stuff you did from the blizzard con,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.040]   BlizzCon or whatever it was called.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.160]   Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.240]   That was fun with Leroy Jenkins.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.760]   That was fun.

[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.960]   Good.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.880]   Well, we can't wait to see that.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.360]   What's the new show going to be called?

[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120]   So it's going to be a daily gadget news thing?
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   That's the plan.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.480]   Yes.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.880]   Daily is very hard, but we're going to work to make it happen.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   It is difficult.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   It's not just going to be about gadgets, so sorry.

[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.880]   Oh, what am I picking up?
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   I'm going to go season one in the 300 HD DVD version.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   A bundle.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   Yes.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   $98 for Sparta.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   And for heroes.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   A great season.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   I have nothing to say about either.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.880]   I don't really either.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   Now that you've mentioned it.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   Good stuff, though.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   It's going to keep me a busy weekend.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   And you're getting it on HD, of course.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   Oh, starting my course.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.760]   Will Harris is here from, I don't know what to say from where is Will, I guess.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880]   But we know where Will is, but it hasn't started yet.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   Yeah, absolutely so.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   At the moment, channelflip.com just redirects to my blog.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   Okay.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   We'll send you the channel flip.com just to get used to that.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   So just type channelflip.com and go wherever it goes.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.880]   Wherever it leads you, that's where you should follow.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   That's where it is.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   That'll be Will's new IPTV channel, which will launch sometime in the next few months.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   We're all in.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   Next month.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880]   We're all in transition here.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   And Ryan Block is also here on the phone.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   Ryan from Engadget.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   It's good to have you back.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   And we've got you on for one reason, Ryan.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   One reason only to make Will Harris a very happy man.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   Wasn't because you like my charming antics and my fantastic radio voice.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   Because you remind me of Christopher Walken, actually.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880]   Not so.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   That's just, that's Dvorak's own little pet thing.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   Now, remember that Will, when he went to New York City, did two very important things.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   He bought an iPhone and he got engaged.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   But the iPhone is still in his possession, unusable in the UK.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   Although we now know that you at least will have a carrier.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   Well, I hope the fiance is still in his possession as well.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   How's the fiance doing?
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   Yeah, she's okay.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   She's not as excited at being unlocked there as well.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   Oh!
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   So that's the big news.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   In fact, I talked to Franklin Harris up in Toronto yesterday.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   And he used the TurboSim method.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   He ordered a TurboSim.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   Got it in the mail yesterday.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   Flashed it.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   You actually have to copy the data over to it.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   Put it into the iPhone, unlocked.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   He's on the Rogers network.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   I probably shouldn't have said that.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   He's been using an unnamed cell phone network.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   And it's been working great.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   Well, that's method one of unlocking the iPhone.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   But now, Ryan, you broke the story today that there's another method.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880]   Right.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   There've actually been a few methods.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   The TurboSim one, I think, is probably been the most widely used one to date.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   But pretty much everything thus far has required some kind of physical hack.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   You have to hack a sim or you have to hack the iPhone itself to actually get it to unlock.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   Now, there's actually, finally, software that is about to be released.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   It's not actually a yet, but I got to play with it on my iPhone.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.880]   Software that will soft unlock it.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880]   It means that you don't have to touch the hardware.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   You can just pop in the sim and use an application and you're off.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   How is so a sim from another carrier, obviously?
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   Exactly.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   Will, are you going to do that?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   I am really, really going to do that.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   But aren't there two different methods of doing the same thing?
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   Yeah, you have two stories going on.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.880]   So there's iphoneonlocking.com.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   Yeah, well, I mean, there's a second group who is claiming that they're going to have
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   an iPhone, a software-based iPhone unlocking system out tomorrow.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   And then yesterday, a kid named George Holtz from New Jersey discovered a way to hardware
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   hack the iPhone and literally trace, there's solders and traces on PCB of the device and
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   inject some code into the hardware to make that unlock.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.880]   Oh, my God.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   There's a number of methods.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   But this is, I mean, what we're talking about now is the software unlocks.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   This is the mass market.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   This is what you need to have in order to make these devices unlock in bulk and for people
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   around the world.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   I mean, you would have to have a massive Chinese factory working 24/7 to produce a decent amount
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   of hardware hacked iPhone.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   So this is really interesting.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   They say between noon and two, now we're recording this on Friday.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   This will air on Sunday.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   So between noon and two on Saturday, they'll offer this software.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   You said that you've tried it.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.880]   Well, I haven't tried the other guys.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.240]   I've tried the first team who they were the first to announce that they had reached a complete
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.880]   solution and that was iPhone 10 free.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   And that's software also known.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   Yeah, that's the software based.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   They did it on my phone.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   So they came over and they did it to you and you suddenly are using T-Mobile for your...
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   Right, exactly.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   I was able to use T-Mobile fan on my iPhone.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   And I have a video on the kitchen, you know, so everybody can see you and it's not a fake
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   or anything like that.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.880]   But so they were the first team and they're not going to be behind the means of the last.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   And this other team is called Unique Phones.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   And they have iphoneenlocking.com and they say that they're going to be the next to have
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880]   a solution.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   And they might actually have the first solution that people can go in and buy on unlock and
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   do it, right?
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   Because this iPhone 10 free, the one that I tested and actually works and all of that,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   it's not available in the public yet.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.080]   And it won't be, I don't know, for a week, two weeks, I have absolutely no idea when they're
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.440]   actually going to start accepting orders for distributing software to unlock people's phone.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   How do you get the SIM card out of the iPhone?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   Oh, it's easy.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   It is?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.920]   You just pop that thing on the top off?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   It just comes right off?
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.920]   Paperclip.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.480]   Paperclip.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.920]   But you don't need to do that with this software.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.000]   You just run software on your computer?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Right.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.960]   Well, no, you have to actually run it on the iPhone.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.120]   So there is a very nominal amount of hacking that can be involved.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.960]   So you've got to get an app on your iPhone.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.520]   So you have to unlock your iPhone to the extent that you can get an app on it.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   Right.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.960]   And I mean, they haven't shown me the final release of whatever they're going to be releasing.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   So I don't know.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.440]   It would probably be a little more user friendly by the time they release it to the general
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   public, right?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   Right.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   I mean, what I can't really speak to detail about the process that they used to unlock my
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.920]   phone because they're asking not to really discuss in, you know, deep turn.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   Any detail?
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.120]   I mean, kind of they're working really hard to monetize right now and they want to get
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.880]   a system set up where people can come on and order iPhone unlocks for their phone.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.760]   And I don't know what the final release will look like.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.320]   I mean, it could just be a small app that you download and you run it with your iPhone
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.840]   plugged in and boom, it's unlocked.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.480]   Or, you know, it could take some other form.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.920]   I don't know right now.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   But do we know?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.880]   What unique phones is claiming is that they're going to have a solution they will buy and
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.880]   do tomorrow.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.200]   They say it'll be between $25 and $50.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.600]   And already 450,000 people according to you, according to the gadget have signed up for
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   this thing.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.440]   This is actually Sean Cooper writing an engagement.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   So that's amazing.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   I mean, that's what they claim.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   We have no way of verifying.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.320]   Well, I believe it doesn't cause anything to sign up.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.280]   I mean, there's obviously interest in this.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.920]   Yeah, I'm sure half of those people are probably scooped Apple and played.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.680]   Well, we'd like to get one.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.520]   So there are a couple of questions coming to mind.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.240]   You have to have activated the phone first using iTunes and AT&T or no.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.960]   No, that's not true.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.360]   The method that I tested and just so we're unclear because there's all these hacks are
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.680]   coming out about the same time.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.400]   And, you know, I know it's really hard to keep track of it all.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.320]   Well, that's why we're having you on, Ryan.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   Right, exactly.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   It's your job.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.600]   The method I tested, the iPhone SIM free method, the application that they gave and ran on my
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600]   phone.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:59.520]   That's software only and it is able to be used on any iPhone device regardless of activation.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.440]   So if you went into an Apple store, bought an iPhone, walked out with it, never called
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.880]   a team team, never activated online, never turned on iTunes with your iPhone plugged
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   in.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:14.000]   You would be able to get on, you know, run the software presumably given whatever their
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   final release looks like and get that device activated offline and start using it with
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   a different carrier.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.640]   So you would never have to interact with AT&T, you would never have to call or sign up for
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.960]   a contract or cancel or anything like that.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.080]   It would really basically just be popping in, run some software, do a couple quick things
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.600]   and then put in your new team.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.040]   But would you be able to use iTunes?
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.240]   I mean, as soon as you plug in iTunes doesn't, iTunes have the potential of saying, "Hey,
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   what is this?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.440]   We're going to erase it or whatever?"
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.200]   Yeah, you know, so I tested that among a number of other things.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.960]   I put in the hacked iPhone in iTunes with the T-Mobile Sim.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.760]   It didn't detect the phone number because normally when you bring up your iPhone in
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.800]   iTunes it shows you your phone number and some information about the device.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   Everything looked fine.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.840]   I mean, it syncs fine, it moved content back and forth.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   It's a normal iPod.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.920]   Yeah, no, I mean, it treated it as a regular iPhone.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.760]   It had absolutely nothing different about it except it no longer was able to show my
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.960]   phone number in iTunes.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   But the sync was fine.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.680]   I was able to copy media back and forth.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   I was still able to make calls and do everything I needed to do with it.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.880]   So, I mean, it was really a very seamless experience.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:32.000]   How long before Apple tries to push something down that says, you know, that obviously they
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   can't do an over-the-air patch, but they might be able to use iTunes as a vector to
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.800]   get into that phone and do something to you or not?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.880]   So, I mean, the one thing I can verify is that it's restore resistant and that is to
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.440]   say that if you restore your phone to factory defaults and reload all the iPhone software
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.680]   which people occasionally have to do, the hack is persistent.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.280]   I restored my phone last night and when I came back to it, the T-Mobile hack, you know,
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   it's still present.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   I was still able to get on my T-Mobile sim.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.840]   I didn't have to activate it through iTunes or anything like that.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.720]   Does anybody have any idea how they're doing this?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.640]   And why it's happened all of a sudden?
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.720]   All of these people are figuring out all at once.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.120]   I think that's just coincidence.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.640]   I mean, the software, this was the first software hack that we've seen so far.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.400]   So, that we can say with some certainty, like this is the first true and proper software
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   hack.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.080]   We've also seen these SIM hacks as we've gone.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.440]   We've seen the Turbo SIM and there was another SIM reprogramming hack.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.800]   And they've come out like, you know, once a month.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.160]   This hardware hack came out yesterday.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.080]   I think that was just by coincidence.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.880]   But the iPhone SIM-free guys initially announced a few days ago.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.360]   And then the unique phone guys, they announced, I think, first a couple of days ago.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.200]   And now they're announcing that they're going to be doing it on Saturday.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.280]   So which one will are you going to do?
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   Whichever one I can get first that works.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   Probably both.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.600]   Yeah, I think most people probably feel that way though, right?
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.480]   I mean, it doesn't matter who's providing it or even in some cases what the cost is.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.640]   You've already paid $600 for a phone.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   Exactly.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   You know, $50 a hundred dollars.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.280]   Yeah, it's like, you know, buying anyway.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:17.160]   Well, you know, I have to ask though, how, well, first of all, AT&T must be dying here.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.280]   Because they had a five year lock on this phone.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   Right.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   In America.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.280]   In America.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   So that's over.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.240]   And what has been the response from AT&T and Apple to any of this?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.760]   Have you heard anything from them?
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.200]   No, they haven't said anything, which is not surprising because they don't usually comment
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   on these kinds of things.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   I think it doesn't exist is what they're doing.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Right.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.640]   I mean, to them, they want to call as little attention that this is possible, which is
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.200]   hilarious because I mean, it's obviously all over the news.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.040]   Well, it is only going to be geeks though, right?
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.720]   It's going to be the hardcore geeks who are going to do this.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   Do you think the general?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.120]   I mean, APU, you know, Reuters, every major news agency has fixed it up.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.040]   I guess if it's a story tomorrow, it's going to be in the news.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.200]   If it's really easy to do, I guess, I mean, people are already, people will buy unlocked
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.520]   phones all the time or go to unlocking services to unlock their phones.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   So that's not a big deal.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:09.640]   I think ultimately AT&T is alarmed by this because that means their US competitor T-Mobile,
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.320]   you know, they're going to be able to start using iPhones on that carrier, which is not
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   so good for AT&T.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.560]   Well, I'd be still a T-Mobile customer if this had been available when the iPhone came out.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   Right.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   Absolutely.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   I think a lot of people would be challenged.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   I wouldn't have switched.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:29.600]   But Apple, believe it or not, probably has more to lose than most people might think because
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.680]   like almost every other cell phone manufacturer out there, Apple has a really amazing deal
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.280]   with AT&T where they get a cut of activations.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.840]   They get a cut of new customers and they get a cut of the monthly fees.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.400]   So every activation, every customer that isn't going AT&T that is going to T-Mobile
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   in America, Apple is actually losing money on that.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.000]   So yeah, they're still selling the handset, but they're still losing cash.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.480]   Maybe more deals set up.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.200]   Maybe even more cash than they made on the phone itself.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.520]   I'd say they made 300 bucks on the phone.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.800]   We're talking thousands over a two-year period.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.240]   I mean, that's very likely.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.480]   That's kind of the exact all amount there is not really known.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.960]   But it's a little known fact about the situation that I don't think people will really take
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.520]   into account is that Apple, believe it or not, isn't just making their money on the iPhone
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   by selling the iPhone.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.440]   All I could say is I'm thrilled.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.320]   I mean, not just merely because people will be able to get an iPhone, but frankly, I was
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.520]   angry that Apple sold this locked down phone and forced us to go to AT&T.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.240]   And I think this is the revenge of the nerds.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   That's great.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.360]   Well, I mean, all this always seems to do is really just show everyone that the will
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.960]   and the perseverance of the technology in hacker community will always give the end user
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   what they want.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   Never underestimate that.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:02.200]   And openness and just cross-platform openness that everyone deserves.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   I completely agree.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   That should have been there since the beginning.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.800]   It's the heart of the heart of your luck, something down.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.240]   The harder people are going to try to break it back open again.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.080]   We've seen that again and again.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.520]   Now, I believe it's a really desirable device.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   Well, that's true.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.000]   Nobody's unlocking the zoom at this point.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.440]   I mean, you could get it on Woot.com for $150.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   Any takers?
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   No.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.800]   So just real quickly, I want to ask you one more question about the iPods because you
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.240]   ran a story and now that story's been taken down.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.640]   It started at 9-5apple.com, right?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   It's a 9-5 match.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   9-5 match, yeah.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.360]   It's one of the newer Apple rumor sites.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.720]   And at first you look at it, the whole thing didn't even look real.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.400]   They had pictures of a fat little iPod that they said was going to be the next Nano.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.800]   But see, Apple should just ignore these things because it didn't even look real and Apple
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.520]   sent out a cease and desist letter and said, "No, you better pull that down.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   That's our property."
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.120]   Yeah, it was pretty funny because when we got the image, we were extremely skeptical.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.480]   Does it look real?
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.080]   It was a photo of a screen and on the screen was a Photoshop document.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.920]   You could see it said, it's like NanoFlower.psb.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:19.040]   So you know if somebody's working in Photoshop, the likelihood of that being real is obviously
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   greatly diminished immediately.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   Right.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:27.000]   But yeah, I mean as it turns out, we as did a number of other sites received a cease and
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.520]   desist order.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:35.000]   And as it turns out, unlike usual leaked images and photography and information that comes
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.160]   from Apple and other sources, this one was "stolen."
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.480]   I don't really know exactly how that works, but the end result is that normally we don't
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.680]   ever take any content down from a gadget.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:52.360]   But in this instance, we were advised from our machine gun and lawyers to actually take
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.360]   it down.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.520]   So we did, but we just replaced it with an exact mock-up replica of the image itself,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.640]   including a version of the iPod Nano that is supposedly depicted there.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   It's ugly.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.240]   I hope they don't sell this thing.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   It's ugly.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.080]   But it sure lends credence to the story when Apple says that this image has been stolen from
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   Apple.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   Right.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.640]   They don't come calling or knocking if it's not a real image.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   Right.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.600]   So they automatically confirm it there, which is so very uncharacteristic of Apple.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.200]   But the same time, they don't always send a cease and desist or send their lawyers after
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.640]   people when sites break news.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.520]   I mean, we have the first images of the new Apple keyboard that's in the new iMac that
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.200]   really spent aluminum on.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   And we never heard from them.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.560]   They never came knocking on that day when we had that big scoop.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.000]   So I mean, it's, I don't know, it's here, there.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.640]   I guess they decided this time they would have lost more to an action.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.240]   I have to say that even, I don't think they're ever going to release anything that looks
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240]   like that.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   It's just not.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.720]   It's too ugly.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   Any speculation?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   I mean, will there, do you think?
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.520]   No, I know you're speculating here, Ryan.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.160]   But do you think there will be an iPod announced next month?
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.720]   Well, I mean, I wrote an editorial a couple of weeks ago stating that I firmly and strongly
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.520]   believe given how long it's been since the last iPod release.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.200]   And the kind of trends that they put themselves in the last couple of years that the next
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.120]   and future iPod releases will continue to be in the September October timeframe since
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.280]   that's typically when they like to get these devices out.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.760]   I think it's very likely we're going to see an iPod in the next couple of months.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.120]   I would recommend people hold off on their iPod purchases because I think it's almost
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.160]   guaranteed that there's going to be a new model iPod before the holidays.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.360]   Whether this is it, I don't know.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.720]   I mean, if you're thinking about buying a nano and you're concerned that that might
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.800]   be what you're going to wind up with, but they buy one now.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.360]   Buy the old one.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   Exactly.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   That's a fat nano.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   All right.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.000]   Well, hey, thank you so much for joining us, Ryan.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I'm going to let you go.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.480]   I know you want to get back to work.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   Ryan Block is the editor in chief.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.760]   Is that your official title?
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   Let him get that's my title.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:05.040]   Editor in chief at Engadget.com and you could see the non real non stolen images of the ugly
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.840]   iPod there as well as all the information on unlocking.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   Thank you, Ryan.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.680]   Thanks.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.160]   All right, gang, what do you think?
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160]   New nano, new iPod.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   What do you think Veronica next month?
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.000]   Well, I don't know about next month, but I'm really hoping for that.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.800]   We've discussed so many times that non iPhone iPod, the one that looks just like the iPhone.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   The touch thing.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   Exactly.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.400]   And I've heard we've been talking a little bit.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.040]   I was on Buzz out loud the past two days and we talked today about a click wheel, a virtual
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.800]   click wheel that would be on the new iPod.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.040]   And that's pretty neat.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.920]   I think it seems a little strange to me, but at the same time it goes with their whole
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   aesthetic.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.840]   I don't feel the need though on my iPhone for a click wheel.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.280]   Do you feel like that's missing?
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.520]   I haven't missed it.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.000]   You know, like I'm not nostalgic for the click wheel, but I can see why they might throw
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   one on there.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.120]   Well, you do the finger throw and that gets you kind of zipping through that stuff.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.160]   I don't think that would really be intuitive.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.280]   I mean, because you're sort of making a fake thing to, well, you're making a fake thing
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.240]   to interact with when you can just interact with the actual thing.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.240]   I haven't worked thumbs.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.480]   I haven't heard thumbs learned to do that whole motion by now.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   The role.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.640]   Isn't that like built into our DNA at this point to do the scroll?
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.440]   I know when I first held a zoom.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.080]   That's the first thing I tried to do.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   Click through it.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.840]   Well, I think I think Ryan's right there will be a new iPod or two or three, but who
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.480]   knows what it's going to look like.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.160]   And I doubt it very much is going to look like that picture.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.400]   It's strange that Apple was so anxious to get them to pull that down.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   I know it's weird.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.920]   I don't usually act like that.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.840]   Oh, well, I don't get it.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.720]   I would love an iPod though with that iPod with the iPhone's glass surface and that big
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.200]   screen and like 120 gig hard drive in it.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.640]   That's really what I'm waiting for.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   Well, but that's awesome.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.640]   And then FM radio.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.800]   That's also part of the rumors is that they are going to go away from these hard drives
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.960]   and they're going to start all being all flash.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.160]   Well, but the flash is kind of prohibitively expensive at this point to get up any higher
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.720]   than eight gigabytes.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   Right.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.680]   So maybe hard drive and maybe a little bit thicker than the iPhone is.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.640]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   I don't know.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.120]   I tell you, they would sell a lot of them, but would they stop selling iPhones?
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.640]   Maybe this whole unlocking thing is perfectly timed.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.240]   Maybe they planned the whole thing.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.200]   You know, I wouldn't put it past Steve Jobs.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   Would you?
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.400]   I could totally see him doing that.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   Hey, good news.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.600]   Our friend, Justin Azerik, we had her on last week on Mac break weekly with her 300 page
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.720]   AT&T iPhone bill in a box.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.240]   I think all us iPhone users yesterday got that message from AT&T saying, we're not going
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.440]   to itemize you bill anymore.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.960]   I think that's good for them.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   Yeah, victory.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.760]   Victory is ours.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   Save some trees.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:53.560]   AT&T, by the way, dropping the fewest dropped calls slogan because apparently it's not true.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.280]   I had no idea that they dropped that.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.280]   That's really funny.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.040]   They have fewest dropped slogans, maybe.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   I don't know.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.320]   Apparently, I guess there was a legal fight with sprint over the issue and AT&T has just
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.760]   decided, nah, it's not worth it.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.320]   They were arguing over the numbers of who actually has the fewest drop calls.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   Wow.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.440]   You know, all the cell phone companies claim the same, basically claim to be the best coverage
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.280]   and none of them have it.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.160]   It's all a little bit different though.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.360]   Like, what, like the largest coverage plan?
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.240]   Verizon is like, you know, that's the one where you, can you hear me now?
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   Can you hear me now?
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   That's reception?
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   I don't know.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   Bogus, the whole thing's Bogus.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:39.560]   Let's see, the other big big story was Skype last week and I guess John C. Devore excused
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.120]   me on this on cranky geeks because when Skype announced that it was because of a windows
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.880]   update, I thought that is just passing the box.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.120]   Skype said it right up front.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.320]   No, no, no, no.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   No, nothing nefarious.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.960]   It was not an attack.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.520]   It was just a problem with our network and then on a blog, one of the Skype guys said,
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.640]   well, we actually think it was because everybody downloaded the windows update and rebooted
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.400]   at the same time, logging out of Skype and then back in causing huge network traffic and
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   we didn't handle it well and we collapsed.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.960]   I agree with John Bogus.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.080]   Anybody, I mean, what's going on there?
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.600]   Robert, do you think that windows is to blame for Skype's problems?
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.120]   If that's true, that would just, that would be kind of a, in my opinion, just critical
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.840]   of the IT department itself for allowing that to happen in the first place for a critical
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.440]   system to respond that way to a windows update without further cuts.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.320]   Well, and also these things are rolled out.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.600]   They're not all at once.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.600]   It's not.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.060]   Well, even so, but even say all the systems were set up to just receive the automatic
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:44.840]   update and to reboot that for a mission critical server of any kind is unacceptable.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.800]   And I have a hard time believing that myself.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   I would believe more.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.600]   They had said was there systems that rebooted.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.560]   It was saying your systems, all the people out there who had windows that rebooted.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.240]   The users would cause their end to fail somehow.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   Yes.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.040]   That makes even less sense to me.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.560]   That's pretty sure.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.720]   I think it all has to do with the Friday beer kegger that the IT department at Skype is
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.200]   having and it just got in the way.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.120]   Are you insinuating that someone, someone got drunk and unplugged the cable by accident?
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   They still spilled.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.280]   I could spilled beer in the right rack.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   It's all over.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   I mean, I need that computer.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   Go ahead.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.240]   Now, somebody said that Skype's backing off on that, that they actually don't.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   Sorry.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.880]   We've got the hells angels going by here.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   Excuse me.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.600]   The Skype is backing off on that that they don't.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.520]   I think in a, I'm trying to find the Skype ball.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   I had that.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.520]   Totally backward.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.360]   You're saying now that they were saying that it was the users computers.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   Yes.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   They said that worldwide.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   Because everyone was rebooted.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   Like, after the patch.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.360]   So everybody reboots at the same time after downloading all those windows up base and then
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.040]   there's like millions of machines all trying to connect to Skype and login.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.960]   But it's on the face of it bogus.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.320]   Because first of all, if you accept the automatic reboot, it happens what?
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   At 3am.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.760]   Well, 3am is different every single time zone.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:06.280]   So it would be a rolling reboot anyway.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   They said, I don't know.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.360]   Mr. Box seems to do its update whenever I first turn it on.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.680]   If this news it finds it, it'll give me about 10 minutes of warning.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.560]   If I don't hit a key and then it'll do its thing.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.440]   But if you leave a computer on all the time, it'll do it at 3am in the morning.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.520]   Unless you change that default.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.640]   So I'm looking at the Skype blog.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.560]   I see the August 20th posting saying that it's Windows fault.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.680]   Well, they say it's our fault, but it was caused by Windows.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.640]   But I don't see any backtracking.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.160]   So what they're saying is that as of August the 21st, the latest thing is that it was
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:46.960]   Microsoft's fault, but the Skype network couldn't handle the amount of reboots.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.880]   But it doesn't make any sense anyway.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.240]   It just seems crazy.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   This is this.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.760]   It is something legal.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.000]   Log in requests.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.680]   Yeah, this makes me think it was an attack that they're covering up something now.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   You know?
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   Why would you need to cover that up?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.560]   I mean, they're admitting either way that they have a weakened infrastructure that can't
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.560]   handle either a rolling restart of Windows machines or an attack.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.680]   Why put it on Microsoft and not just tell us what really happened?
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.360]   They said it's a bunch of supernodes that got rebooted.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.440]   It was a perfect storm.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.120]   And the storm had never happened before.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:29.720]   So again, supernodes being rebooted, how does that relate to the end user though?
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.040]   Because the end user's being supernodes.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.680]   And what looked like what was broken on Skype was the ability to register with a Skype
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.960]   server.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.400]   So I was able to launch Skype, but I was never able to see anybody on Skype because I wasn't
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.600]   able to log into the Skype server.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.320]   I mean, my client does show 5.2 million people currently on, but yeah, there's a lot of users.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.520]   But I don't well, anyway, I just to me, I think we need a there.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   That's not the explanation.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.480]   And I think there I don't know if they're I don't get it.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.600]   Maybe we'll get somebody from Skype on and we'll get Villou Arak to talk about how this
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   could possibly have just seemed crazy.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.000]   It doesn't seem right.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.800]   It's seen that, you know, if they just left it alone and said, hey, we had a server problem.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.760]   Sorry, we screwed up.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.920]   Then I wouldn't have been suspicious.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   But now I'm suspicious.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.040]   Well, there's somebody posting a ton of these crazy blogs.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.400]   Was the Skype outage caused by government monitoring?
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   That's it.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.160]   It's the two of the two of the five.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.800]   Skype network has been a concern of government intelligence, actually since its obsession.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.280]   How coincidental is it that 10 days off to Bush signs into lower bill, giving the government
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.200]   authority to track far more.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   Resclyte.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   Suddenly has a massive worldwide.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   Oh, no.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.640]   I knew it.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Of course.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.840]   It's a pretty good conspiracy.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.920]   I got to give him credit.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.120]   As far as conspiracy theories go, that one's pretty solid.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   Who's played bio-shock?
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.360]   Can you be played bio-shock?
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.120]   Oh, I'm glad that's my whole weekend.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.680]   They're saying it's the game of the year.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.720]   Is this is would you say that's true?
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   Absolutely.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.720]   Really?
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.840]   It's yours Gears of War, for sure.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   Totally.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.080]   PC audio and video are gorgeous in this game.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.600]   I'm playing the PC version and I downloaded it through Steam.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.720]   I'm barely scratching the surface at the beginning of it right now.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.240]   So far I have to say the audio and video production and the storyline and the environment and
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   everything.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   It's working for me.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.600]   It's definitely an adult-only title, but it has the creep factor and the fun factor
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.640]   that I'm into it.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.200]   We have it on the 360 and it's just been a really fun experience just to even watch.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.720]   I have to run out and get it.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.920]   Is it on the Half-Life engine or is it a new engine?
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   It's available.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.040]   I forget who's engine it is.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.520]   It's the new Unreal Engine.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.760]   Oh, it's the new Unreal Engine.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.040]   It's the same engine that Power with Gears of War, but apparently the developers have done
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.160]   like a whole bunch of work making like water effects and things.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.640]   The water and the fire effects are unbelievable.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.200]   Like it looks real.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.560]   The fire is amazing.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.160]   And whenever you go underneath water, you get like the sheath of water rolling down.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.320]   It's really artfully done.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   The heat effects too.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.240]   Like when you get that slight wave of like you fire a weapon or something and the heat
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.760]   that comes out of the end of the barrel actually distorts the air and it's subtle, but it adds
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.920]   on top of everything else that's going on and it really, really draws me in.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.120]   The lighting effects too I find are just top notch.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:23.960]   It's a first-
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.160]   And all the Art Deco architecture.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   Ooh, Art Deco.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.120]   I've always loved the Unreal Engine.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.000]   I always thought the Unreal Engine was a great engine.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.400]   I'm glad to see it's being updated and kept alive.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   Indeed.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.240]   It's the first-person shooter?
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.480]   Is it kind of like Half-Life story or?
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   Totally.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.920]   Well, I mean the story not really, but the style of play, yeah.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   What's the closest thing it's to say it's like it's sort of like the spiritual success
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.720]   to System Shock, if you remember that?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.200]   Yeah, I loved System Shock.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.280]   It's very much like the various games.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   But yeah, but yeah.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.080]   Yeah, System Shock was a fantastic game.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.320]   Although it predated really these great visual engines.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.320]   So I'll be glad.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.680]   System Shock 2 at least was the scariest game I think I've ever played.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.280]   I thought Half-Life was scary.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.120]   Those things that jumped out of your face.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.640]   There were points in System Shock 2 where I just couldn't finish the game.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.240]   There was something behind a door making a noise and I jumped out of my chair like three
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.880]   times in 10 minutes and I couldn't do it.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.360]   I'm like a winner.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.640]   You can't make me.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.040]   I'm gonna play with the lights on and blank it around me.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.160]   Yeah, I'm like a player.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.080]   Well the Wii is still tops in sales.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.360]   As long as we're talking gaming, let's get the latest gaming news and the Sony PS3 price
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.000]   drop though did give them a bump in sales.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.640]   Not enough to take over.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   Not enough.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.480]   The Wii is really amazing.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.640]   422 was the DS.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.160]   Nintendo's hot.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.040]   Everybody's buying DS's man.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.400]   It's like the ultimate console for everybody.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.400]   Now why?
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.040]   It's the DS game that's moving.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.600]   Well it's all the casual stuff.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.800]   It's the fact that any body can go in and find a DS game that they want to play with.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.920]   You're a boy girl, young old.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.240]   You will find something on the DS that you're gonna love.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.360]   Either it's Nintendo or Brain.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   The Brain's.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   Brain.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.440]   Or it's something more hardcore, it's Zelda or whatever.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:19.040]   And it's so easy and intuitive that that pen interface anybody can get to grips with that.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   What's your brain?
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   Let me ask you the same for me too.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.480]   Let me ask you 20-some things.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.920]   What's your brain age, Joe?
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.280]   Oh, my brain age is like 40 or something.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   I don't like it.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   What's your brain age?
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Yeah, I suck.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   I don't have it.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.280]   Oh, all right.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   I haven't tested myself on that one.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   My brain age is 26.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.280]   I just want to let you know.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.080]   I'm gonna say I think I'm in the mid-20s too.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   And you know what?
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   I need to pick that up and start to do that.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   You and me, Robert.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   That's all got well.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   You're not as old as me.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   That's all guys.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.760]   Hey, there's a new Brain Age 2 now.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   I saw it.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.320]   I think my Nintendo dogs are all dead.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.840]   Do you have an intent dog?
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.560]   I think I killed them all.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   What kind of dogs did you have?
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.960]   They're probably hanging out wallowing in their own filth at this point.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   Now, come on, really.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.080]   Do you visualize them as inside the DS?
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   Just living there.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.040]   If you don't open the DS, they're still there.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.600]   I haven't played with my DS in a while.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   I'm a little embarrassed.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.320]   I have an original, one of the electric blue one.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.760]   And so I'm embarrassed taking it around because everyone has a DS light.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.760]   So I feel bad.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.680]   I have two DSs and I haven't played with them in a while.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.160]   One black one.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.040]   The Professor in Brain Age also admonishes you when you've been away for a while.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   He's like, "It's a little round."
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   "What have you been?"
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.760]   I know it's funny, isn't it?
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.360]   I'm still playing Clubhouse games, though.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.440]   It's like a general pack of different backgammon card games, board games and things like that.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.760]   But it's got a really sweet Wi-Fi or just online play or local link play where you can
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.120]   hook up with someone else and either do a random game or hook up with friends of yours
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   and play really easily.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.400]   And I dig that kind of thing.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.680]   I think you have to say the DS is the winner since it's the oldest of the four and it sold
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.440]   405,000 units in July.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.720]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.280]   425,000 weaves sold.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.360]   Now you compare that with 159,000 PS3s.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   I mean, that's up 61.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.920]   Just look at the price difference.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   What is it?
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.360]   $99 for how much you pay for it for DFS?
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   $99.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.320]   Oh, is it $129 still or did it drop?
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.600]   Yeah, for this is like $4.99 or whatever.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.080]   I mean, it's just so much more affordable.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.360]   Xbox 170,000 down 14%.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.880]   So it looks like people are not buying Xbox.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.120]   That's probably because of the three red rings of death people have been talking about.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.120]   I bet you that hurt.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.120]   No, I don't know.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.280]   I think it's more of a kind of saturation type of thing.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.000]   Maybe everybody who wants one has one.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.760]   I mean, other than guitar hero too, there haven't been too many games lately.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   Other than biopies, that just came out like what?
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   The day before yesterday, yesterday?
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.280]   It really had a chance to catch up.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.280]   Anybody who's playing any kind of racing game that was playing Forza 2 on the...
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   Okay.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.640]   You're going to get a big bump next month, Halo.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.640]   True.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.760]   I'm waiting for Team Fortress 2 on the PC.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.760]   That's what I'm really waiting on.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.680]   I don't want to turn on my Xbox 360.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.560]   I'm not going to turn on because I want to work when Halo 3 comes out.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.040]   I don't want to kill it before then.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.520]   I want Spore.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   Spore.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.840]   Apparently, the folks at OneUp got a copy of Spore.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.000]   And I played it someplace.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Somewhere.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   It's done.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.440]   It's not polished and finished, but it's done.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.680]   It is an actual working game at this point, which is very hopeful for me.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.680]   That's the game I'm going to do.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.080]   It's still coming out next year, huh?
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.000]   Yeah, 2008, probably spring.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.920]   That's got to be Will Shorts being just perfectionist, right?
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   Will, right.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   Will Shorts is the guy.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.560]   Disposals in the crossroads in the New York Times.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.560]   Will Wright being a perfectionist, right?
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.560]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.040]   I think-- I don't know what the reason for the delay was.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.480]   I can't remember off the top of my head, but it's either him really wanting the game
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.800]   to be wonderful, which I think it will be no matter what.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   It will.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.480]   Or it's just such an intense game and such a system eater because it has so much stuff
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   going on and such a--
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   Also, you've got to think that it's going to require some hardcore bug testing because
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.920]   the amount of ways there are to play through the game, if you've got to try and find all
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.000]   the problems with it, you're going to have to play it for hundreds of thousands of hours
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.400]   to sort of do the different iterations and stuff, aren't you?
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.200]   Right, because it's got the single player and the massively multiplayer.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.800]   There's just tons of different ways you can do it.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.280]   The screenshots look so spectacular.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   I just can't wait to play it.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.000]   It's going to be fun.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.560]   It's going to be fun.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:37.160]   The writer.com says, "Oops, it looks like Thursday intruders swiped 1.3 million names
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.560]   and job seekers information from the employment website.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:48.440]   They used a program called Winspalm, which is, I guess, a hacker tool that sniffs sensitive
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.960]   data from Windows memory.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.080]   An email must have gone to Monster.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   Somebody must have opened up the email.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:04.320]   They're a recruiter that patronizes Monster and they got 1.3 million records.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   Ouch.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   Ouch.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.640]   That's got to hurt.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.720]   The company says, "You'll pick boots."
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.720]   Yeah, really.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.880]   At least if somebody steals it from Craigslist, you feel like, "Well, it was just Craigslist."
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.800]   You know, Monster seems like it should be more secure.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.920]   They shut down the rogue server where the store-land data was being stored and only names, addresses,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.680]   phone numbers and email addresses were found.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   So they believe that that's all that the guys got.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.280]   No social security numbers?
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   No.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   Would you put your social?
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.040]   I don't think you'd have your social- Some people do.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.280]   Some people do, but they're social.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   They're resume.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   It's like a bad idea.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   It is a terrible idea.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.120]   Why are you doing that?
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.440]   Yeah, really.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.720]   Why would you put that in?
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.400]   I haven't seen the ads yet on YouTube.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   Has anybody seen the ads there?
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   Putting ads now on YouTube.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.240]   Yeah, I heard about this too and I haven't seen one yet.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.720]   I went out and looked at all the popular videos.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.240]   But apparently it's going to be lower thirds.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.520]   The bottom 20% of the screen will have an overlay which will not stop the video.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.600]   It's not a pre or post-roll.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.960]   You actually watch the video and then overlays there and then it disappears.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.920]   But if you click it, you can watch an ad.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920]   Seems like a good idea.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.160]   Video eggs have been doing this for a while.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.360]   Like video egg really deserves credit for coming up with this kind of overlay system.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.680]   Yeah, YouTube monetize it.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.560]   They didn't claim to have invented it.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.560]   No.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.560]   This is a...
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:30.000]   Although, I have to say it on the YouTube blog post where they ask for feedback, a lot
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   of negatives.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   A lot of...
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.600]   In fact, a number of people said I'm never posting another video on YouTube.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.000]   That's just the normal noise you get when you do anything different.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.200]   Or do you think this will hurt YouTube?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   It adds...
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.040]   Like, pre or post-rattle, it doesn't mess with anything that you're doing.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.880]   Whereas, putting stuff over the bottom of the video as it's playing is sort of like...
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.680]   You know, some people feel like it ruins the video.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.400]   If you've actually already got lower thirds in your content, then adding an overlay of
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.200]   the top of it is going to mess it up.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.640]   Well, one of their defenses is that TV shows do that all the time.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.480]   And if you ever watch TV before, I mean they constantly...
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.880]   You have a people hate that.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   Exactly.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.040]   I'm about to say, like, I can't stand it when an ad comes up in a lower third or when G4
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.400]   squishes down their programming to do a ticker underneath with all info about other junk.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.920]   Like, I just want to watch the show if there's commercials before and after.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   That's fine.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.600]   If I'm watching a web video and there's post-roller pre-roll, I'm okay with that.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.640]   But don't cover up my content.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   But do you watch it?
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.400]   I mean, the truth is this is in response to the fact that people just skip these ads.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.080]   If there's pre-roll, I'll usually watch it if it's short enough.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.680]   If it's 15 seconds or less, I'll watch it.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:59.200]   I've seen like one minute pre-rolls and you just think, "Oh, I've stuffed that.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.640]   I'm not watching a one minute pre-roll."
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.200]   I hate the websites now.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.360]   They're websites that make you watch these ads before you get to the website.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.560]   I bet you a lot of people click off of sites and video when they do that.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   I do.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.640]   That's probably why they're doing these inserts.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.800]   Because, I mean, this is the real problem for advertisers.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.240]   How do you get an ad in a show that people won't skip over?
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:29.440]   Well, you make it interesting or relevant or good advertising is not obtrusive.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.640]   Good advertising adds value to content.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.600]   And people just need to be more imaginative and creative about how they do it.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.160]   Which reminds me that this broadcast is brought to you by the folks@audible.com.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.960]   There you go.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   Well done.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.920]   Yeah, I slid that in there.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.240]   No, we're really glad to have them.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.400]   I think this is an example of an ad that works because people who listen to podcasts might
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.040]   well be interested in audio books.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.920]   And then one of the reasons I decided to make it a book pick every show is that there's
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   something of interest there.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.280]   Even if you're not interested in Audible, there's something you might want to read or
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.440]   hear about.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   Anybody have a book pick?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.400]   I should have asked you ahead of time.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.280]   I have plenty, but I just thought I'd give you a chance.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   Yeah, I'd put a good one if you fancy it.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.640]   Yes, I do fancy it.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   Which is a...
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   I've got two.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.200]   In fact, number one is William Gibson's Spoot Country.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   Did you just eat that already?
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.520]   Yeah, well, Patrick did it last week, but absolutely.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   Have you read it?
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.680]   Oh, I'm just in the middle of it at the moment.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.320]   I'm such a Gibson fan, but it's not sci-fi, right?
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:36.080]   No, it's a little bit different from previous stuff, but I still think it's pretty fun.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.400]   If you've already done that, then I would definitely recommend the Alistair Campbell
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   Diaries.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   What's that about?
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.600]   I haven't heard of that.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:49.800]   Well, Tony Blair is basically his guru for all the years that he was in office as this
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   guy, Aris Alster Campbell.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.000]   He was the royalty robe of the...
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.480]   Yeah, basically.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:02.240]   And he's got this massive memoir out, which is just stunning insight into how an earth
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.000]   politics gets run in the real world.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.960]   There's loads of good stuff about Bush and Clinton and all this kind of thing.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.440]   It's just a fascinating insight into politics if you're into that sort of thing.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.720]   They have it at a bridge, which is probably okay, because I find nonfiction often it's
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.440]   okay to have it at a bridge, frankly.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.720]   It's called the Blair Years Extracts from the Alistair Campbell Diaries.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.240]   Yeah, and he actually reads it as well.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.720]   He's a pretty good speaker, so it's very well worth listening.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   Oh, fun.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   I have a great book too.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.560]   I've been reading Ron Susskind's The 1% Solution, which is kind of the...
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.440]   Inside the Bush Administration during the anti-terrorist stuff.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.920]   And it's a little chilling, frankly.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.080]   Highly recommend this.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:54.520]   This is actually 1% doctrine deep inside America's pursuit of enemies since 9/11.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.640]   Ron Susskind, another great book.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.200]   Anyway, these are all audiobooks, which is nice, because you can kind of get your reading
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   done without stopping your life, whether you're driving in the car or you're doing yard work
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.080]   or working out in the gym, I do while I'm shopping.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.640]   You listen to these books and you get a lot more reading done.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   It's really great.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   Audible does a nice job.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.000]   They make it 35,000 plus titles on over 230 different devices.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.600]   Of course, all the iPods in the iPhone, but lots of other devices too.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   And I think it just really works great.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.240]   AUDIBLE.com/twit.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.320]   If you subscribe today, you get a credit toward a free book to be any of the books we've
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.640]   mentioned or any of the other 35,000 volumes, audible.com/twit.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.680]   We do thank them for their support of the Twit Network.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.480]   I've just learned that they're going to stick around for some time.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.240]   They've been very happy with the response.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.200]   So thank you, Twit Army, for supporting the show by supporting Audible.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   Excellent.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   Yeah, excellent.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.400]   Nikon has decided they're going to enter the full frame fray.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.600]   How do you like that?
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   Awesome.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.720]   I just got a 5D, which I love.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   The idea is that the pickups are 35 millimeter.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.760]   They're full size, which means a few things.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.160]   Of course, a bigger pickup means better images, but also you don't have to multiply by the
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   lenses.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.720]   Nikon has kind of held back from this, but they finally have decided to do a D3 12.1
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   megapixels.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.200]   It could go on sale in November.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   Little pricey.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   It's for the pros, 5 grand.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   Oh, I'm going there.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.840]   I'm going with Canon's EOS 21D Mark III, the 21 megapixel.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   And you believe that?
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   Oh, it's like a grand, though.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.480]   What are you shooting billboards?
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.680]   No, but it's like shooting outer space.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.600]   No, it's so gorgeous.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.760]   It's like crack.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.800]   You get more and you know, the 5D.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.880]   Now I can't go backwards.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.080]   See, you want more.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.440]   You get more and more clarity.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.120]   You get broader, personal ranges.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   It's just amazing.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.880]   Yeah, I can't talk.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.880]   I just I have a Canon G7.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880]   It's fun.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   I enjoy quite a bit.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880]   That's a great camera.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   Yeah, that's a great camera.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.640]   Are you going to talk about that kind of stuff in Mahalo or is it going to be?
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.000]   I'm going to do some gadget stuff, but it's mostly how two videos.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.240]   Because that's what Mahalo is.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.720]   It's going to work across about subjects.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   Right, right.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.400]   And they have a how-to section.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.280]   That's really great that they're developing.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.720]   And so I'm going to be doing some videos about the how-to guides, but also just a lot
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.880]   of general interest stuff.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.560]   I talked to Josh Wolf last week, so he's going to be on a future episode.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.240]   Running from mayor of San Francisco.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.240]   Correct.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.480]   And I'm going to talk about how you can get involved with local politics.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.600]   So it's very wide reaching.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   A lot of different stuff.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   I love that.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   That's great.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.920]   So we'll look forward to that.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.000]   Big big big news in the DRM world.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.920]   Boy, lots of it.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.800]   First of all, for internet broadcasters, good news.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.840]   SoundExchange, which represents the record labels, has dropped the DRM requirement and
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:56.280]   they are offering a reduced royalty still to broadcasters.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.600]   Ders didn't like the DRM.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.080]   And they're not crazy about the terms apparently.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.040]   So there's still some argument going on.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.600]   At least there's, I think at least there's some movement, which is encouraging.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.240]   It seems very give and take.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.840]   They'll give in on one area, but then push a little harder in the pricing or whatever.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.560]   It just never seems to come to a conclusion.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.360]   We've got to get Rusty Hodge on.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.520]   He was a webmaster at Tech TV, now runs Soma FM.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.480]   He's really hates the offer.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.360]   For instance, the latest is in order to qualify for these reduced rates, you have to earn
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.160]   less than 1.25 million.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.520]   That seems reasonable a year.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.200]   Rusty says that's way too low.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.040]   They should use the Small Business Administration standard cap, which is 6 million.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.800]   If you ever want to have a guy from SoundExchange on, I had a gentleman on, buzz out loud one
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   time.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.240]   He was a very good word of SoundExchange, and he gave a little bit of that side of the
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.240]   whole story.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.960]   Was he pretty good or was he the devil in car name?
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.240]   He was not the devil in carnet.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.400]   No, he was a very well-spoken, intelligent guy.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.200]   It was interesting to, because we automatically side with the webcasters.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.440]   I mean, at least I do personally and ever even thought about it.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.120]   But then talking to him, I got a little more of a sense of how they're seeing things.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.160]   So it's good to get that other side of the coin.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   Good.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   Good.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.360]   In fact, maybe I'll get Rusty and somebody from SoundExchange on that would be a great
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   kind of back and forth.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   We'll work on that.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.600]   I'll get a hold of you after the show.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:36.360]   Walmart is doing DRM-free downloads from Universal and EMI, and it's $0.94 for 256
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.360]   kilobits.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.640]   Watch out iTunes.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.880]   Anybody want to buy their songs from Walmart?
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.880]   No.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.800]   They had $0.94 to MP3s without encryption.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   What kind of selection are they?
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.960]   Are they going to have popular music or is it a specific library?
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   Oh, I guess so.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   It's all pericomo.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   Okay.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   All the time.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.960]   Jackie Gleason, pericomo.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.960]   All your favorites.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.440]   No, I think it's Universal and EMI.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   I think it's the same things.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.440]   It's their entire life.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.360]   It's just the same stuff, right?
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   Well, it's not clear.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.000]   I mean, they didn't say what songs, but I would imagine.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.480]   It's just going to be the same stuff you could already get on iTunes, I would think.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.360]   In which case, he might as well just get it on iTunes.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.400]   What I'm wondering about is what's the pricing deal difference in terms of what they're
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.720]   giving to the artist as compared to iTunes?
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   Is Walmart just taking a bigger loss or are they giving less money to the artist and
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.880]   to the labels or what?
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Good question.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.560]   Now, I want to point out that you cannot get these Universal songs on iTunes DRM free.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.320]   Universal didn't do that intentionally on iTunes.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.800]   Basically, they're trying to get companies like Walmart to compete with iTunes.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.120]   They don't like Apple's dominance of this business.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.760]   In fact, it's expected that they'll go to Amazon as well.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.360]   That makes me think then that probably Walmart was able to give Universal more money for
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.520]   track than Apple is currently giving them.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.640]   I think really what we're seeing, we certainly are seeing the end of DRM.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:13.280]   It's unfortunate that Apple, Steve Jobs, did recently step up.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.600]   They'll say, "I don't want to do DRM.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.360]   They're making me do DRM."
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:22.040]   Now he's losing that battle because they're not doing DRM and they're not doing it on
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.040]   iTunes.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.320]   He's made a lot of enemies in the record business and pushing back on this.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:32.200]   This is unfortunate, but I think this is going to shake up iTunes.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.840]   The problem is, of course, iTunes owes its dominance to the success of the iPod, but
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.480]   you could put these unprotected things on iPod.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.840]   It's just not as easy.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.400]   It's not as straightforward.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.080]   I think people do like that ability to push a button and have it appear.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   What's not as straightforward?
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:53.120]   Well, you could buy the songs from Walmart and import them into iTunes, but it's an extra
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   step, right?
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.120]   Yeah, it's like one extra step.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.440]   It's not horrible.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   Not horrible.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.920]   Yeah, because I download a lot from eMUSIC and it doesn't really bother me to have to
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.480]   import those after.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.200]   So you think this could undermine iTunes?
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.800]   It's possible.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   It's possible.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   It's possible.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   Anything could happen.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:17.280]   Anything could happen, my friends.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.680]   Flash is going to support H.264.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.120]   You're excited to care about that?
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.280]   Probably not.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   I care about it.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.960]   People who do video, you should care about it, Veronica, because it means your flash
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.560]   video quality will go up.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.560]   Yeah, that's always a good thing.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.760]   Always a good thing.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.440]   Google says they will participate in the auction, the 700 megahertz auction.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.800]   We now know that it'll be January 16, 2008.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.760]   The bidding will be anonymous.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:53.360]   FCC says that the reserve price is $10 billion for all licenses combined.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.040]   But bidders have to put up a $4.6 billion reserve.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   Amazing.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.040]   Google's money.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.040]   The Google phone.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.240]   Well, Google, you know, yes, it's very good for if Google does participate.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.440]   They haven't said if they're going to participate.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.960]   They seem to be leaning in that direction.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.200]   Remember, they said we won't participate unless it's an open and that you can re-stubbe, you
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.560]   know, requirement to resell.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:20.280]   FCC didn't go for all of the open conditions.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.560]   I'm hoping that Google will still participate.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.080]   I really want them to get in there and undermine the wireless companies.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.800]   But we shall see.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.640]   That's at least we know when that auction will be a be.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.320]   Coming up soon, January 2008.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.400]   Movie pirate.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.760]   This is your story, Will.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.440]   Movie pirate forced to ditch Linux.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.680]   Talk about fate worse than death.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:53.040]   I mean, if you're the exit minute of the elite Torret's bit torrent tracker.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.840]   So, I mean, this judge obviously has a sense of humor.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:02.120]   So this kid gets busted basically for uploading Star Wars episode three.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.040]   He's like seeding it out on his torrent client.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.160]   And obviously he's like a hardcore Linux user because that's what a lot of these guys
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.160]   are.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.280]   Well, the judge, you know, sensing him says, well, you know, I'm not going to stop you
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.360]   using a computer.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:21.800]   But obviously you're super-lit hacking, you know, computer with it's Ubuntu operating
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.280]   system and all this stuff.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.040]   You know, that's too high powered.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.440]   You've got to use Windows if you want to do anything.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.760]   That's a fate worse than death.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   That's pretty harsh.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   Oh, ow.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.280]   So this kid is busted dead to fleece.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.720]   He can enjoy some good Windows games now.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.600]   Don't you think he can hack on Windows just as well?
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   Of course.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   Honestly.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   I don't know.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.800]   This judge is really in fact, this judge, this could, this could be the law of unintended
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   consequences.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.920]   This judge could be unleashing this guy on Windows and all of a sudden he could create
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.520]   all these hacking tools on Windows.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.280]   I think it's just, I mean, he's obviously going to be able to do just as much damage
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.720]   in your torrent as well on Windows as you can on Linux.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.120]   But it does just seem like, you know, for Linux fanboy, that's could be a fate worse
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   than that.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   Well, maybe the judge knew.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.960]   He actually want to get you on this, Robert Heron, because I thought this was very interesting.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.480]   Paramount has announced that it's not going to put out its movies on Blu-ray any longer.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.160]   It's going to do them on HD DVD.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.360]   By the way, Michael Bay was not happy about that.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   He said, that's it.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.960]   I'm not putting out, no transformer two for me.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.880]   For some reason, he doesn't like this move to HD DVD.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.880]   And then he changed his mind.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.080]   And then he went back?
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.480]   Yeah, he drank the Kool-Aid according to Engadget.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.360]   Did he get some of that money that supposedly was put up for this exclusivity?
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   That's what's interesting.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.200]   Yeah, he said he's heading back on Transformers 2.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.600]   They showed him the check.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.960]   Oh, come on, Michael, we can, we can cut you in.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   Wait a second.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   Cut you in.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   So what happened?
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:00.200]   So HD DVD, which is mostly Toshiba, right?
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   Yes.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.560]   Yeah, Microsoft.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:09.600]   And Microsoft paid $150 million to Paramount and DreamWorks to move from Blu-ray to HD DVD.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.600]   Wow.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   Exactly.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.640]   To ensure some exclusivity for titles.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.120]   I don't know if there's a time limit on this.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.120]   I imagine there is.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.240]   It's probably for like a year and a half or so, but that's the way it works.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.880]   Both camps have been doing similar things.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   I mean, we talked about a couple of weeks ago how Target was switching their end caps
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.640]   to be Blu-ray and caps when in fact, you know, it made big story and it sounded really
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.400]   great, but it turned out you could still get HD DVD movies from them as well.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.760]   And obviously Blu-ray paid them to do that.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.080]   Certainly there's that reason that is the primary reason for any movement either of these
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   sides are going to.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.200]   Neither side is going away.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:50.120]   They are trying to secure some exclusive titles for each format to make them both seem,
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:55.800]   you know, better or to give them a little unique feature when in reality, neither format has
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:01.040]   a technical advantage with, I guess you could argue that the size capacity version of Blu-ray
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.920]   itself is one advantage, but it's minor when in terms of just the quality of HD video
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   itself.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.120]   You got it.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.360]   Who loses, of course, it's us, the consumers, right?
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.480]   I mean, all of this shenanigans.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:19.080]   Okay, they got $150 million, but who loses we do because there's two formats still and
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.960]   it just makes it so work.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.400]   But I continue to tell anyone who listen, we went through this with the last recordable
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:31.480]   disc format war quote unquote war with dash R and plus R and eventually we had dual format
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.160]   players where suddenly the discs themselves really didn't matter.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.600]   We have a dual format player available right now.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.240]   It's granted it's LG's rather just more than buying two independent players.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   That's true as well.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.800]   However, there will be a good one.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.880]   Well, I assume it will be a good one to sing from the specs I've seen so far, at least
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.560]   from Samsung that's coming up, but it too will be over $1,000 initially.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   That's a lot of money.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.480]   Yeah, you still can buy two separate standalone players for less.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   Right.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.800]   And then there's Warner Brothers who's releasing their films in both formats and they also
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.320]   have that dual format disc that they were working on.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   Right.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.560]   You know, I'll be at CDU next early next month and that was one of the meetings I have scheduled.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:08.920]   They want to show me this disc format.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.720]   Now, they're being kind of, they haven't come flat out and said, yes, on one side of
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.680]   the disc, we're going to have HD DVD on it on the other side where I have Blu-ray, but
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.240]   I'll be curious to see if that is what it is.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.920]   Well, I can't figure out how else it would work.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.360]   They didn't do it on either side of the disc.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.920]   They're not because they're very incompatible formats.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.360]   They're not right.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:34.040]   Unlike DVD plus or dash and the plus which were very similar, these are not that similar.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.320]   So Sony, Disney, Fox and MGM.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.320]   This is the scorecard.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:42.080]   Just if you're following along at home, Sony, Disney, Fox and MGM are Blu-ray.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:48.160]   Universal and Paramount now are HD DVD Warner Brothers smack dab in the middle with both.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.320]   Oh, man.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.200]   I mean, it really is.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.400]   It's going to come down to dual format players that remove the confusion of what format to
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   buy or getting these players down a sub 100 bucks and you just buy two of them.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.400]   Totally.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   Totally.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   Well, it's quickly approaching that for HD DVD.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   I think that's going to happen.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:10.280]   I think that's the main advantage right now with the HD DVD format is cost.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.520]   It is just some of the players out there now are just about to break the $200 mark.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.200]   So do you think they're subsidizing it that this is again an example of kind of trying
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.880]   to boost the market by offering a little more?
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.040]   They very well may be losing a little bit, especially on some of the low end players
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.600]   that they're selling.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:30.240]   I can't imagine that they're making very much of anything off of those low sale prices,
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.760]   but it is getting the players out there and just prices for both formats is pretty much
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:38.280]   a wash as far as I can tell, at least looking at Amazon.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.840]   I mean, for my own use and collection, it's like I don't even pay attention to the format
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.840]   anymore.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.120]   It's just whatever one is available, I will get it on either hide F disc format.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.040]   But I guess I'm an early adopter for that particular case.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:56.360]   Or you know, you can just buy a console that plays one or the other, get a PS3 or get a
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:03.280]   Xbox 360 with the HD DVD drive and then get a separate Blu-ray player or HD DVD player.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   Totally.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.520]   That adds just another layer to the home theater mess that I'd rather not have to do.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:13.120]   It would be not to have that as just one standalone player that'll do both or even a
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.240]   single player with both drives and two distinct drives would be kind of funny.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:21.480]   But yeah, it's a shame that people have to worry about this or even think about it.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.960]   Still think the sales numbers overall are still pretty small for both formats, especially
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.480]   when you compare them to the DVD, the entrenched DVD market that's out there right now.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.200]   Yeah, that's a really great idea.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.400]   Why don't they have players that have two separate drives?
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.400]   Because I mean, if they have like the LG.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.000]   Why you're just without that.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I'll go ahead.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.400]   I was going to say the LG just has one disk drive, right?
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.520]   And that's why it has crippled HD DVD playback.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.080]   It doesn't play all the features on the HD DVD disks.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   Right.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   The BH100.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   Exactly.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.360]   And as well as I believe they're super multi blue player, although I think that would be
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   more of a software thing.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.760]   If you're using the PC drive itself as a playback device, that would probably depend more upon
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.080]   the software features than it would on what's supported.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.080]   Right.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.800]   The drive mechanisms are cheap enough now that you could easily build a box with both drives.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.760]   Why doesn't some third party come along and do that?
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.320]   And pay me as a consultant.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:17.960]   We sneezed somebody to make one box with both drives in there.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.360]   And that would still be a pretty expensive box.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.600]   I mean, it could easily roll up into being more than a thousand dollars.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   Okay.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.680]   But I can imagine that at least then you wouldn't have the crippled features.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.680]   Right.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.680]   True.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.600]   I'm holding out hope for Samsung's new player that's coming out here before the end of the
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   year.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.920]   That should be a full featured drive for both players.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.520]   And it'll have the persistent swords.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.640]   It probably will also have the new features in Blu-ray, including that match what's currently
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.320]   available on HD DVD, namely the network connectivity for online interactivity.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.320]   No.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.840]   And for easy updates of the firmware.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   Right.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.000]   I could be wrong though.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.440]   It might not be a hardware issue.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.080]   It might be a licensing issue for the HD DVD stuff.
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.240]   I think it's licensing.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   So that's all null.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   Never mind.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   Never mind.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.560]   All the kids say the L.D. player, it isn't an officially licensed HD DVD product obviously.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   Right.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   Right.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   So.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   Right.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   Apple having a very good quarter.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.000]   Their laptops now are 17% of the market.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.800]   They are the number three manufacturer after Dell and HP.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.200]   There is definitely a halo effect from the iPod and the iPhone.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:29.160]   In the last 90 days, up from 12% in June to 17% of laptop sales.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.520]   That's got to help a little bit.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.360]   The desktop sales were 7% down though from 8%.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.520]   So it's the laptops that are really moving the Mac.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520]   And that makes sense.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:45.040]   I know a lot of people who bought Mac laptops might still use a PC for work or you know,
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.480]   but they like the laptops, the Mac laptops.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.440]   I think pricing probably has a lot to do with it as well.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.240]   Those are some of their more affordable entry systems.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.000]   As far as Apple goes in their hardware listing.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.920]   You compare that to like the G5 desktop series and you can blow a lot of money on one of those
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]   boxes granted.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   They're beautiful and nice.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.680]   But Dell is still number one.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.960]   But their market shares dropped 30%.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.000]   No, I'm sorry, 7% 30% of purchase.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.640]   Just 30% of purchasers said they bought a Dell desktop in the past 90 days.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.320]   That's a seven point drop since June.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.880]   The second lowest percentage is recorded for desktops in this change wave survey and laptop
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.880]   purchases 24% have fallen four points.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.640]   So a Dell's struggling a little bit still HP pretty solid, but the Apple coming on strong.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:35.520]   Also an update on a story we talked about last week Comcast categorically denies that
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:39.360]   they are throttling bit torrent traffic.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.720]   He said, well, I don't know.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.920]   He says the company doesn't actively look at the applications or content.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.160]   It's customers download over the network, but they do reserve the right to cut off service
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.720]   to customers who abuse the network by using too much bandwidth, which they won't tell
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.720]   you how much that is.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.240]   And they just when they do, they quadrupled my upload speed recently.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.760]   Yes, for no fee.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.200]   And then they think they more than doubled my download speed.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.760]   It is just insane how fast my Comcast connection goes now.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.040]   Competition's a good thing.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.920]   They're looking at Verizon with their files coming after them and certainly sell.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   And so that's good.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.760]   So anyway, just to update, we talked a lot about that story last week, but the response
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.200]   from Comcast is, nope, we're not doing any bandwidth shaping.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.840]   And time to set up that tour connection with your encrypted everything and it'll slow down
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.960]   to a crawl, but at least it won't open DNS start using it.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.480]   The stormworm, anybody get any stormworm spam?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.720]   I think, you know, everybody now is running so much anti spam software and anti antivirus
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   software.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.520]   It seems unlikely that any you guys would be getting it.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.600]   During the talks I saw a DEF CON, it's not even viruses anymore.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.920]   It's all about malform web pages, drawing people in and getting click on something.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.560]   That's the big target right now.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.040]   I don't even I don't run anti virus software on anything I own personally.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.760]   This is exactly how the storm Trojan is you're getting is getting on your system.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.680]   You'll get what is essentially a phishing email that gets you click on a link, which
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.760]   then has the Trojan on it.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.880]   The Trojan just heard you say that now and it's coming for you, Robert.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.880]   No, no.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.240]   That's why you use open DNS, though.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.720]   It helps me mitigate some of those bad websites that are out there.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   Okay.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   They block them?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   Well, it's also a whitelist too.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   Whiteless, blah, blah system.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.920]   Yeah, but you use open DNS as well.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.600]   I like it a lot for you and I like their 404 stuff.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   It's helpful.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.680]   And it's a quick and easy change anybody could do to either their router or their personal
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.080]   computer and it doesn't affect your ISP performance, at least not, not any way I can tell.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.480]   No, it seems very kind of set another.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.240]   So what Robert's saying, instead of using your internet service providers DNS settings,
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.800]   you just use open DNS.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   You can either do it on your system or I put it on my router that way.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.920]   All my systems are covered and you know, I had some problems with it a few like a year
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.480]   ago where it seemed like it was a little slow, but it's not now.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   It seems very fast.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.520]   Now, say I thought I was having a DNS related issue with Comcast, so I went and changed
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.520]   it and I never went back and changed it again, but I've been satisfied.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.520]   Open DNS.com.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.520]   It's really simple.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   They have this instructions.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520]   They aren't word.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.520]   They never remember.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.520]   It's .com.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.520]   It's .com.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.120]   Because they make some money, but I don't know how.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.920]   I can't wait for that.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   I'm not certain either.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.240]   I think it's the searchers.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.200]   I think when you get, if you enter in a bad address, you get what they do instead of giving
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.160]   you just a plain old 404 is you get search results and then they have ads at the top
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   of those search results.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.760]   And I gather that's how they make their money.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.760]   Simple enough.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.000]   The great mystery of the internet.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   How do you make your money?
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   How do you make money?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.840]   So you're in the Twitter offices now.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840]   I am.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.000]   Do you ever ask them that?
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.520]   No, no, we don't talk about business too much.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.920]   I'm just using their desk space.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   You've got Evan Biz.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.720]   That's a good bunch of people over there.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720]   They're great guys.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   Doing some great stuff.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   They just sold MTV.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.200]   The MTV V or awards are going to be on Twitter.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.760]   Very interesting.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.760]   That's I think really the first mainstream use of one of these microbliding services.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.400]   Yeah, they've partnered with Human Giant in the past who is a sketch comedy show on MTV
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.800]   and they covered the music awards or the movie awards.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.280]   I think it was.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.840]   And so now they're going all out with the VMAs this year.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   That's great.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.800]   So what that means is that somebody backstage will be Twittering.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.280]   Is that?
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.280]   I guess so.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.200]   I guess they probably have a dedicated Twitter person.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   A Twitterer.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   A Twitterer.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.920]   Twitter Pounds of Jiku, which is it for you Veronica?
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.840]   I am on active on both Twitter and Pounds.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   I like Pounds.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.280]   Yeah, I see you on Pounds all the time.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.640]   I really like Pounds a lot.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.360]   I use it differently than Twitter.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.640]   But Pounds is still private beta for some reason.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   Oh.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   They haven't opened up, have they?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.640]   I don't think so.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.640]   They still have.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   Yeah, they haven't.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.240]   You don't get it quite for some way.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.280]   There's still a few bugs every so often.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.040]   It's a good way though to make it something cool and the cool kids.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.360]   For some reason, whenever I post things, it posts it like 30 times.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.360]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.920]   So then I fill up a whole page with one comment.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   That's not good.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   It's not good.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:14.280]   I think what is quite cool though is if you can make a cross post between Pounds and Twitter,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.800]   if you use this something called Twitter Feed and you set Twitter Feed to pick up on the
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.560]   RSS for your Pounds and post it to your Twitter.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560]   Right.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.560]   And so you get automatic cross posting so you can use both.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.440]   That's why I see why that's good.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.920]   I see why that's good, but I find it really redundant and I feel like it annoys people
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   more than anything.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.840]   I don't like seeing people's Twitter feeds on Jiku.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.920]   I do that on Jiku.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.160]   Jiku will put any RSS feed on there.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.640]   And then same thing with Facebook.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.280]   You get your Pounds and your Jiku on.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.480]   You're on Facebook and your Facebook status message.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.960]   It's all very circular.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.760]   It's all circular, self-referential and very self-absorbed and I'm embarrassed to even
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.800]   admit I do it.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.480]   But that wraps up this edition.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.120]   We thank you so much for joining us.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.560]   Veronica Belmont is now at mahalo.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.640]   M-A-H-O-L-O.com and we look for you.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   M-A-H-A-L-O.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.240]   My Hawaiian is rusty.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:13.840]   M-A-H-A-L-O.com and Mahalo Show debuts next month.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.760]   Flip TV debuts next month.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.560]   Will Harris.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.320]   Channel Flip indeed is going to be very, very exciting.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   Channelflip.com.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.120]   Adam is a friend on parents in the meantime.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.120]   Oh, I will.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   You're not my friend?
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   I think you are.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.120]   I was just saying to the listeners.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   Oh, to the listeners.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   Is it W-I-L-H-A-R-R-I-S?
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   All right.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.600]   One at all on the will.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.080]   Just to be some sort of thing British people do.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.840]   Veronica Belmont is Veronica Belmont on Pounce, probably.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.480]   And I'm Leo Ljord on Pounce.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   Are you Veronica?
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.480]   Just Veronica.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   Okay.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   Veronica.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   On Twitter and Pounce.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   Just Veronica.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   Because there's no other Veronica.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   She's the one.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480]   Aww.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   She's the only one.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   That's not true, but thanks.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.920]   And Robert Herron and Roger Chang continue on manfully despite the loss of Patrick Norton.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.920]   Who has moved on to locations unknown?
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.680]   Well, he announced it.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   It's all right.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]   He announced it on Twitter last week.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   Oh, I'm supposed to.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680]   I should have talked to him this week.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   It's okay now.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.680]   You can say it.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.680]   He's going over to revision three.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.960]   He admitted it.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.080]   So it's all, you know, again, once again, incestuous, self-involved, all circles within
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.560]   circles, we don't really know anybody.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.560]   We just know each other.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.080]   Big, happy family.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.280]   And we are one big, happy family.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.120]   We're so glad you're part of that family.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.080]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.040]   And we invite you to come back again next week.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.040]   Another Twitter.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   This is amazing.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040]   And we'll see you again.
