[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.520]   Lots to talk about a new presidential administration. Is that going to be good or bad for Big Tech?
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.680]   Hard to tell. We'll talk about Alphabet and the end of the loon balloon. Apple's stock on an all-time high.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.040]   And what's the story with Clubhouse? Is it really worth a billion dollars? All coming up next.

[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.200]   The show where we talk about the week's tech news. Louise is just up the road a piece. Louise
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.160]   Mizzakis is with us but she is a senior editor at a brand new publication called Rest of World at
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.360]   restofworld.org. Hi Louise. Hey thanks for having me. Yes I am in LA which is nice. I'm not too far
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.560]   from you for one. Yeah down the road I guess not up the road although it depends if the world's on
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.240]   depends how it's oriented. Exactly. Yeah you're south of us that's better.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.360]   Anyway great to see you. Congratulations on the new. This is a non-profit publication
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.440]   aimed at covering what's going on in tech everywhere outside of the US.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.120]   Is that right? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah we don't really cover western Europe either.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.640]   The only other exception. No offense to my fellow Europeans here.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.040]   But Latin America the Middle East Asia that kind of thing.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.320]   Yeah I was the east of the Balkans too is fair game. We cover Russia.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.920]   Just know what no EU and no US basically. I know Australia either. Sorry.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.200]   So how did that I mean did you draw lines? I mean
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   well it's sort of also sometimes Australia has broken out but it's also sort of just based
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.480]   about where we saw there wasn't a lot of coverage. Yes. There's some coverage in China I would say
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.920]   there's some pretty good coverage in India but there's a lot of places that are just not covered
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   at all especially when it comes to tech. So that was sort of our mission. I love it. Where
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   where can we really fill a need. And I was scanning through and there's articles I can't wait to read.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.600]   I think this is really great. Thanks so much. Yeah I think it's a really good idea. It's something
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   really different. I think there's probably enough publications covering you know Google in San Francisco.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.920]   Yeah and it's actually been a problem with this show and people often call me on it.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:26.160]   You're so US centric you know. So today we're not. Nate Langston is also here. He is a tech editor
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.760]   actually in charge of Europe. Europe Tech Editor at Bloomberg Consumer Tech reporter. Hey Nate.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.960]   Hello everybody thank you for having me. I'm very pleased to be here. I'm going in reverse order
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.280]   of the people staying up the latest. So Louise is in our time zone. You're in the UK. So you are
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   what eight hours nine hours later. I'm eight. Yeah I'm eight hours ahead of you. So it's just
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:58.800]   gone 10 30. 10 30. Yeah I'm here. But guess who is in tomorrow land. Patrick Bezha not Patrick.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.360]   He is in France not Patrick.com. It's great to see you again Patrick.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.320]   Thanks yeah I'm actually in Finland. Oh you back in Finland. Okay.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   Forest yeah yeah absolutely. So I'm it's already tomorrow indeed and it's it's basically every
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:25.360]   time I call on the show I go to bed at an insane hour and we talked with Jason who's producing now
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.960]   and we decided to do it now because in a couple months I'm going to have another baby so no more
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.200]   this week tech for me. Congrats. Congratulations. I don't know if it's congratulations or are you
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.440]   insane. How many kids do you have. Only one for now. You got room for a while. That's okay.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.680]   Sure sure. Yes let's go with that. I thought you were talking about your new podcast with Tom
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.280]   Merritt work in sanity. I thought that was your new baby but you mean an actual human child that's
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.720]   a yeah that is quite a commitment. Well done. Yes you know podcasts I have so many I can't it's
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.480]   like children indeed but I have famous for us but yeah work in sanity is really fun. Nice.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.360]   Yeah Nate was saying his wife likes it which is that's great. She does.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.040]   She does. Bringing endorsement.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.360]   So this is an interesting week because the you know the Great Britain you guys are trying to
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:35.760]   figure out where you're going to get your ham from. Here in America we've got a new ham in the
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:43.520]   White House so it's all very confusing but I do there is some tech news and we're going to
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.640]   we're going to stay with that instead of the the political news this week which is nice because
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.000]   honestly it's been pretty political for the last few months because there's been this intersection
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.640]   of and I think it's going to get that way again because we're not in a moment of a pause
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.520]   but I think the prosecution by the FTC and antitrust prosecutions of Google and Facebook are about
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.760]   to get back underway once you know the everything else settles that they're not they're not off the
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.800]   hook by any means. Do you agree this is not something that is going to be dropped not in the EU either right?
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.120]   I don't think so.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.480]   Certainly he doesn't see that.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.480]   Louise seems like that. Go ahead Patrick go ahead.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:37.920]   It certainly seems that like there is something to be discussed and fixed and legislated and a few
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.640]   things actually the difference is now we're probably going to be able to understand what is being said
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.760]   and why these things are being said most of the time but yeah I don't think the discussion is going
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.000]   to end because of the change of the administration. There are new problems that have arisen in the
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.840]   past decade I would say and those need new societal consensus and discussion and probably some form
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.400]   of legislation and that's I don't think that's a bad thing. We need to understand the issues and
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.120]   get on the same page on how to deal with them and there are many of them so.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   European seem more willing perhaps to regulate big tech here in the US because there are American
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:31.760]   companies for one thing. There's a there's a bit of division of opinion on this Louise.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.120]   How do you come down on this? Yeah I think the question is are we going to see
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.160]   meaningful discussion of this. I think there's a lot of news stories and there's going to be
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.480]   continued to be clashes between governments and big tech but I don't know if any of the big
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.720]   questions that definitely do exist are actually going to get addressed very soon. I do think that
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.120]   these antitrust cases are going to foresee that you're seeing a very similar theme in China where
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.280]   they're going after their tech giants and wondering if there are market questions there.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.800]   And then there are a lot of speech questions and there are privacy questions and I think that
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.920]   neither of those have really been approached in very thoughtful ways. The EU tried I think with GDPR
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.400]   but there are still lingering questions there. The US needs a privacy law. Is any of this going
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:21.040]   to happen soon? I don't know. This week I felt a lot the last couple of weeks I should say I felt
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.680]   a lot of PTSD from 2017 in Charlottesville. It seems like we really didn't learn a lot of lessons
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.240]   from that. You saw the same hammer coming down on some of these long time bad actors but suddenly
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.720]   the platforms decided they were too bad. So the question is are we going to be proactive now or
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.560]   is it going to be another thing where something really horrific happens and then we decide
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.520]   retroactively okay that was a line. I don't know I see these things repeating a lot. It's very
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.160]   cyclical at the moment. I hope there's actually some progress. Yeah it seems like US politics is
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.040]   very cyclical. So maybe that's what it's reflecting. Willow Ramis writing at 1-0 on the medium says
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.400]   how could Biden reshape the internet or not? There are two schools of thought. One recalls the
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.880]   Obama administration's cozy relationship with Silicon Valley. Notes Kamala Harris's ties to
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:18.080]   companies like Uber points out Biden's reliance on tech allies and advisors and so that contingent
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:26.320]   says it's going to be easy for Big Tech over the next four years. By the way Big Tech's lobbying
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.840]   has been pretty aggressive and I think we'll get even more aggressive in 2021. But there has been
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.080]   a lot of momentum as he points out for regulating build at Big Tech. Biden himself was you know
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.360]   express skepticism on section 230. And you know there's a lot that Biden could do.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:54.800]   In this view or Ramis writes the Biden administration is poised to enact sweeping reforms on multiple
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.080]   fronts. A federal online privacy act of course he's replaced Ajit Pai temporarily at least with
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.600]   Jessica Rosenworzel who is a very I think a very good FCC commissioner who is very much pro
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:16.000]   net neutrality but gig economy workers you know prop 22 passed in California
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.080]   Uber and Lyft against Uber and Lyft's expensive campaigns. A rework of section 230 could be in the
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.280]   works antitrust legislation. So it's kind of unknown. Really where we're going.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:37.040]   Really the issue is that we don't really know what to do. We know there are issues in you know
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:45.200]   things like free speech in the gig economy in the monopolies of these companies. But free speech
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.280]   you don't know where to put the line and how to enforce it. The gig economy we know you know it's
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.440]   fairly clear that there are not employees and they're not completely independent either but we
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:04.720]   don't know what to put in a third type of you know status. And same with the monopolies we as you
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.480]   say on this show very often we don't know what to do like breaking them up is not going to fix
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:18.240]   the issues that we have. So I think that there's a lot of people that need to start thinking about
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.840]   before saying we need to regulate almost on a philosophical level. How do we fix the issues
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:33.440]   that were introduced by these society altering models that were created in the past 20 years
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.680]   thanks to the internet the disintermediation the fact that everyone has a voice etc etc.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:46.960]   And the reality is no one knows what to do and that's not a bad thing. Like it's obvious that when
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.720]   things change that much the old models and the old ways of seeing things don't work anymore. So we
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.920]   need to you know think about it and hopefully find solutions but I don't see it as a you know
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.840]   the everything is lost that we don't know what to do right now.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:11.120]   No it's clear we don't on the other hand the EU seems to nate there is pretty aggressive actions
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:19.440]   already in the EU against Google and perhaps Facebook. Yeah I mean Google Facebook Amazon is
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:28.720]   a big one Microsoft has been a target in the past certainly. Obviously with the Brexit situation
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:35.840]   that we have gone through there is an additional question that is over certainly everyone's heads
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:43.920]   in in my country which is what does this mean for the UK specifically you know because we aren't
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.600]   necessarily going to have exactly the same relationship with with you guys and with US tech companies as
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.080]   the rest of Europe will do and that we would have done had we not have
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.240]   divorced ourselves from from that and excuse my dog who's probably just going out with his
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:10.480]   nightly activity. So that's one of the things that I'm particularly keen to see how it plays out
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.280]   but we're not going to know that for quite some time. As far as President Biden goes I think what's
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.040]   interesting from our perspective is we hear a lot through the news over the last week about
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.360]   you know the the Paris climate accord and carbon goals and things like that and a lot of the
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.080]   conversation that happens on a tech level or from a kind of big tech level is all very
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.560]   domestically focused as it should be for any incoming president and administration.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.120]   I think what's going to be very interesting is seeing what happens in that next step like what is
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.720]   that what is the international message that the Biden administration wants to communicate with Britain
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.360]   with Europe with the rest of the world of course as we as I'm sure Louise will have will have a view
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.280]   on and that those are two massive unknowns hugely influential massive potential impact for good or
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:06.880]   for bad but I but I feel in in my waters to be optimistic. There is a you know an argument that
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.680]   the Democratic Party has moved farther to the left that there is bipartisan agreement that we've
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.640]   got to do something about big tech for completely different reasons by the way but that doesn't mean
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:27.280]   that something won't be done that besides Rosenworsel who is again temporary chair of the FCC or acting
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:34.400]   chair Biden appointed Rebecca Keller Kelly Slaughter as acting chairwoman of the federal trade commission
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.920]   she is apparently very aggressive she's been on the commission since 2018 as a Democratic commissioner
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:49.440]   but she is going to inherit the Facebook prosecution and is apparently very concerned about privacy
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:57.760]   and big tech so there there may be at the FTC and she in fact was very critical of the FTC's
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:04.560]   kind of dropping their Google investigation last year there may be actually a much more active
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.880]   much more energy at both the FCC and the FTC to rein in these big tech companies so
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.680]   there's debate about which way it's going to go but it's certainly something we're going to
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.440]   end up watching and I think it's something we're going to hear a lot about in 2021.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:25.760]   Another pick from Biden the chairman of the FSEEC the Security Exchange Commission
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.800]   a lot of people are excited about Gary Gensler because he is a blockchain wonk
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.080]   he actually teaches he's an advisor to MIT media labs digital currency initiative
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:45.360]   and teaches courses at MIT about blockchain so it'll be interesting to have somebody at the SEC who
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.920]   knows what ether and and XRP and stablecoin are.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.440]   I think it's the question then that I would have on that front is is the focus there
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:03.040]   blockchain as a as a ledger tool or specifically the crypto currency
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:10.800]   like it is is more so about like investing right like I think he probably knows a lot if he's
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   going to be at the SEC it's probably going to be a lot about like should we be regulating how people
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.120]   trade these things and I think there's also a lot of concern about things like Robinhood and sort of
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.080]   like these other investment apps so even if it's not exactly just the blockchain tech you probably
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:32.160]   understand very intimately how these things sort of work as a market I wonder if that's part of
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.320]   the consideration there I think it's cool that he has I just you know I hope he's not like let's
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.600]   use this for everything in the government. No I think it's the other way around in fact I think
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.720]   there might be some concern that he sees them as securities and wants to regulate them so that
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.760]   will be well again this is early days we're we're learning a lot about what's going on
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.760]   it's you know in a way it's kind of nice to to see people in these positions who at least
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.280]   you know know what they're talking about have some track record whether we agree with them or not
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.200]   that'll be another matter entirely. Google also facing headwinds in the EU in fact
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.360]   it'll be interesting to see what Google I run that in the EU in Australia. It'd be interesting to
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:22.240]   see what Google does as you know there is a bill in front of the Australian legislature
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.800]   to force Google to pay digital platforms rather to pay news media for including their
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.360]   articles or even snippets of their articles in its search. In response on Friday Google's
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.120]   Australian managing director Mel Silva testified in front of a Senate committee that this proposed
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:50.160]   code was not only untenable but she said if it goes through it would give us no real choice but to
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.440]   stop making Google search available in Australia.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.400]   That's the nuclear option. That's the nuclear option.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.920]   Search engine you got there it'd be a shame if something happened to it.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.160]   You know it's it's really funny because you kind of mentioned it at the same time I think the same day
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:22.000]   in France we've had a law that was forcing Google to give money to the press essentially.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.400]   That's right.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.480]   On-line vacations for the news service that they have for news.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.200]   For Google News.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.440]   And of course Google has been saying listen we can't pay you for sending traffic to you.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:41.520]   And on the same day as or the next day after the Australian thing Google announced that they had
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.240]   come to an agreement to send money to the French press.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.960]   And that was a little bit of a surprise because they had always of course stated that they couldn't
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.040]   do that and that they wouldn't and we've had you know spats in in Spain and Germany when Google
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.480]   where Google actually shut off the Google News service of course they didn't shut off the entire
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.160]   search engine. But the thing that's really interesting and that I'm not sure many people have looked
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.080]   deep enough into to understand is that we don't know to what extent this is the case but they
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:25.840]   have included in that flow of money to the publications they have included traffic.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   We don't know how it's calculated exactly but traffic is considered has a dollar or euro amount.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:40.720]   So it's kind of going back. It might there might be more actual cash in that deal that they're
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.920]   going to funnel through to the publications but traffic is also taken into account which is
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.640]   interesting because of course the big argument has been we don't we shouldn't be paying you
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.240]   we're sending you traffic and you're making money on that. But they do have a deal apparently with
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   the major the biggest major publications in the country now.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.880]   They didn't say how much they were going to pay it is interest it's a precedent and I'm not sure
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:11.440]   it's a good president from Google's point of view. I mean Australia seems to be asking for an
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:17.520]   awful lot more I think than what we've seen countries asking for in the past. I mean I read one
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:27.920]   one story that suggested that something like 10% of the local like the regional revenue
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.160]   so that you know the money that the Australia that Google's making in Australia essentially
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.400]   should be passed directly to news organizations which is you know about three three hundred million
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.640]   dollars or something that's that's huge and that's and I think that's that's probably the main reason
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.120]   why Google wants to make such a big stink about this because like as you say like there is
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.600]   potential for other governments other regulating bodies to look at this and think well
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.960]   Google caved or Google didn't and we've not seen it at this scale before.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.800]   There's also from Google's point of view there's a principle which is that the Australians say
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.680]   not only are we not going to look at the traffic that Google drives to the publishers you're not
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.800]   even allowed to include that in the calculus for how much you're going to pay and I think that
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.760]   probably pissed off Google in a way that maybe it didn't in France where they where they clearly
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.360]   are using considering traffic as being part of the equation.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.680]   The conversation didn't start at that point. No no but they got them to give in.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.800]   Yeah for cereal there was threatening and
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.360]   I think the threat to the is the biggest problem here isn't it. I mean this is
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.800]   this is a this is a very bold ultimatum and I think personally I feel it's going to it could
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.000]   backfire and I think it will it will it will be it will be frowned upon.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.640]   What if it could be even worse than that what if they did pull search out and nobody cared
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.920]   and and people discovered some people have suggested this that's a dumb move for Google because
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.200]   people will discover you know oh duck duck goes not so bad or or a start page is not so
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.520]   better or cozy is not so bad and maybe this could start undermining Google's monopoly
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.120]   in the rest of the world. It could it could backfire.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   I'm pretty sure they looked at the amount of traffic they sent they are sending to those
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:31.840]   publications that are you know fueling that that lawmaking and I'm I'm guessing that they know
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.400]   the publications can't afford. Yeah that's what happened in Spain right they.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.640]   Where they are going to be read like it's where they're going to be read people look at the news
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.720]   on their Facebook feed or they you know they Google it right I mean like you might surface some
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.080]   of this you might see sort of a weird dynamic where the rules of Bing are suddenly like you know
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.960]   really important and everyone is you know optimized for Google.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.680]   Demise Bing.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:00.080]   Bing suddenly and maybe that's what happened but I think that the you know intervening period
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.160]   but you know between Google pulling out and that adjustment would be you know detrimental for the
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.200]   Sydney Herald. Like I'm sort of curious how the publications really feel about this and the people
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.520]   who work there. Well that's why it's the nuclear option that's why you know I mean that really is
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.640]   quite a threat for Google to say well we could always just cut off search. It's also like hey it's
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.800]   a small country you know it's there's not that many people in Australia there's part of what
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.040]   in all of Australia there's half the amount of people there in California right right you know.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.000]   Do you think Google made that calculus said you know we got it we got to show I think they did that
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.440]   in Spain anyway we got to show them what it's like not to have Google.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.400]   I don't think you'd see this threat in the US. No.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.520]   Which is what I can say. Yeah.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.400]   I wouldn't see this threat in a very large country I don't think.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:49.600]   But this has become increasingly common you know you've seen a number of different platforms
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.040]   basically say we're just going to leave and that seems to be an increasingly common tactic
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.640]   and sometimes they take it. Seems very childish. Seems babyish. It's like just you know figure it
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.400]   out work it out. But this reminds me of what Epic has been doing. Yeah talk about babyish.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.760]   Yeah. And that I don't feel that that's playing out particularly well for them because
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:19.440]   well I mean it's embarrassing. Or the lost court hearings. So it's not a great way of doing it but
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.720]   we on a smaller level we've seen it done on a with smaller retailers even in Europe as a
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.400]   response to Brexit like there are some companies now on continental Europe who won't ship to the UK.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.360]   Because it's dealing with tax and customs forms and complaints. It's not worth their effort.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.560]   They're just saying we'll send to anywhere in the world. Except Britain.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:44.480]   Do you remember when GDPR first happened and there were a bunch of like US news sites that
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.840]   you just couldn't view in Europe at all they just wanted load reminds me of that. Yeah.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.520]   Yeah. Trump called it Trump publications right. They were you couldn't you couldn't read those.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:00.080]   It's a local news that just like had old websites that were like really buggy and full of tracking too.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.240]   It was quite a few of the Chicago Tribune the daily news the Dallas Morning News News Day.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:11.760]   Can you see them now? Did they give up a question? Let's find out. I think so. I've never come across
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.200]   one that I couldn't load. But you know all of these things it's kind of part of what I was
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.720]   talking about earlier. It's we're figuring out a lot of things that aren't going to work out on
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:29.200]   the first try. But ultimately might end up coming to a consensus that I don't want to say benefits
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:38.800]   everyone but mostly works. And certainly GDPR when it first came out was I think finger pointed at
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.400]   and laughed at by a lot of people who are saying oh but you do you know you can't work it out that
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:51.040]   you have so many boxes you have to click and yes it's the case but you're seeing other countries
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:57.760]   and locations that are starting to think okay maybe we do need something maybe we don't go as far
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.280]   but we do need something and the thing with the newspapers they ended up finding an agreement and
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.760]   in France at least and maybe they're not going to get as much money as they would have wanted
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.520]   because traffic is included into that calculation. But as a newspaper if you have one additional
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.360]   source of revenue that is helping you out a little bit and diversifying your income I think that's
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.280]   good for everyone in society because you have newspapers that can function a little bit better.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:34.240]   So it's messy but we're slowly over the next 10 or 20 years going to figure things out I think.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.240]   And GDPR is not as much as it was a couple of years I think.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.400]   Well what's interesting is the fines are going to go up this year they're going to get very serious
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   about big time fines now see what happens. And you know I can't access Newsday.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.280]   You can't. No I'm getting exactly the same thing.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.880]   Not missing a thing I just want to say.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.200]   Well that's yeah I mean I know it's quite it's quite a regional tablet isn't it?
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.120]   It's New York yeah how about yeah how about AJC.com that's the Atlanta News.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:14.000]   AJC AJC.com did you do in our chat room who I'm thinking is probably in Australia.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.480]   It's not available. We have VPs if you really want to read them you can.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.840]   You can pretend you're in the US. It's probably the expats that are going to be
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.320]   most affected by this. That's who wants to read them yeah.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.800]   So I can still see them both and I'm in California and well of course you can.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.240]   Well because of the California Privacy Act yeah exactly like when I came here from New York
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:42.080]   actually I did notice like more requests for my data more requests for my cookies that I had
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.120]   in New York City for sure. Really I guess it doesn't rise to the level of GDPR because I can open both
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.960]   of these websites. Interesting. Let's take a little break we got a boy this is a great panel for
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:59.120]   especially for international news. Nate Langston is here he is consumer tech and the European tech
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:07.040]   for Bloomberg in the UK host of the UK Tech show at UK Tech show.com. Nice to see you Nate thanks

[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:15.680]   speak with a pharmacist on staff 24/7 whether you have questions you just need advice. I've been using
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.440]   pill pack which is kind of the back end for this. Amazon bought them a few years ago for a long time.

[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.080]   should they just launched it. I don't know a few weeks ago I've been using pill pack for years
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.640]   immediately went and tried it. It's really a great solution. On we go with the show we're not done with
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:14.880]   Google among the pardons from the president the former president Donald Trump in the last few hours
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:23.440]   of his presidency former Google engineer Anthony Levin Dowsky he was working at Google's
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.640]   self-driving car division. He left found it a startup a trucking startup a thing was called
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:37.840]   auto which he sold to uber. He brought with him however according to google a bunch of
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:43.760]   you know company secrets. In fact the judge said during his sentencing his theft of documents and
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:50.640]   emails constituted quote the biggest trade crime trade secret crime I have ever seen.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:33:03.440]   Levin Dowsky was ordered to pay $179 million including $756 in restitution and $95,000 fine.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:09.840]   I'm not sure the status of that because remember he filed for bankruptcy immediately.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:24.480]   The president has issued a pardon and his sponsors in the pardon kind of not a surprise. Trump
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:31.040]   supporters and tech billionaires Peter Teal one of the first investors in Facebook and Palmer
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:38.560]   Lucky who created the Oculus Rift among those supporting a pardon for Levin Dowsky. The press
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.240]   release says Levin Dowsky paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:51.520]   talents to advancing the public good. So he was sentenced 18 months in prison he wasn't going to
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:58.640]   go until covid was over he won't be going now. I think he still owes the money however I don't
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.560]   think you can I don't think a pardon can let you off the hook for that. So without getting political
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:11.280]   can you do you know what what would motivate the pardon like this? Oh you're just giving me a big
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   fat opening aren't you? You're trying to get me in trouble aren't you? I'm genuinely curious.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.640]   Well unless you know we can say we can say I've been part of it is Peter. I was always surprised.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.960]   It is surprising because it was a fairly big story and as the judge said a fairly heinous
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.720]   theft of trade secrets. I'm sure Google isn't too happy about it. On the other hand he wasn't in
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.600]   jail because of covid 19 and it was an 18 month sentence. It wasn't the law. I wouldn't want to
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.560]   do it but it wasn't the longest sentence in the world. I think the fact that two prominent Trump
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.680]   supporters were in favor of it probably had something to do with it. No innuendo here we'd
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:56.560]   heard news stories that there was a lot of money changing hands in lobbying for pardons. No idea
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.840]   if this was one of those pardons. This makes me think that is Anthony working on something that
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.680]   perhaps one of these investors is interested in. It has to be a convenient reason I think.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.840]   Interesting. Is his genius really that so important? That's sort of how the pardon was
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.920]   promoted. It was the idea that this guy is going to use his knowledge for good and he's so smart
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.400]   that he should be free. I really know about that. He's been shown to have terrible decision-making
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.240]   qualities. I think that perhaps one of these people wants his talent for something. I think
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:39.760]   that self-driving cars is still an incredibly attractive market. That's what I'm thinking about
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.120]   here. I think it also shows me that Peter Thiel is still closer to the president than I might have
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.360]   thought because there's been some reporting that perhaps their relationship has soured a little bit
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.880]   or at least they haven't really, Peter Thiel hasn't made a speech for Trump in a while or anything like
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:01.280]   that. I thought it was very, very curious to see something like this. There were a lot of pardons,
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.880]   all of them curious. Right. It's just so steep and a lot of other famous Trump figures. But I
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.000]   don't think that Anthony was somebody that you would have associated necessarily with being- Hey,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.920]   I would associate him with little Wayne either. Well, little Wayne was a huge Trump's of public
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.280]   Trump's of course. That makes more sense to me. I also think there's probably been a couple of
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.120]   weird Hollywood parties where they've run into each other. When was Trump hanging out with
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:35.760]   Uber engineers? Yeah. The fine probably stings a little bit more than the 18 months in prison.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:45.680]   Yes, just so this is clear, he's not going to do the 18 months in prison, but that's what you got
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.120]   pardoned for. It's not like- because the thing that came to mind- and it's a completely different
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.680]   thing. But just Chelsea Manning was pardoned by Obama, of course. Her sentence was commuted, yes.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.800]   Right. So it's a very different story, but I'm just- if you want to think about things that are
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.560]   a little bit more controversial possibly, the fact that he's not going to do 18 months in prison is
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.840]   not like- He's not going to change the face of the earth at democracy. Does France or Britain have
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:21.440]   anything like this where an outgoing prime minister or president can pardon,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.000]   just willy-nilly pardon anybody who wants? That's a strange thing. The queen can do it.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.160]   The queen should be able to. That's different. We recycle queens far less frequently than
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.800]   prime ministers and presidents. What is it usually someone for? Someone wrongly convicted?
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.880]   Like is there sort of like a theme that it usually goes to? Is it clemency?
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.000]   Who does the queen usually give it to? Is it corrupt? Is it a good thing usually? Or what sort of a
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.560]   pattern? That's a good question. I mean, it so rarely seems to happen, but there was one of a
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:05.200]   murderer, I think, who- someone who he'd ripped a narwhal tusk, something off the side of a museum
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:13.920]   when there was a terrorist had gone on a rampage on London Bridge with a knife.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:20.480]   I remember this. Yeah. And he'd tackle this guy to the ground. He pulled up this narwhal tusk and
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.720]   he breached, I think, the terms of either he was on day release or something. And apparently,
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:36.640]   he got a royal pardon for something like that. So it is a rare act. It's not kind of like how-
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.960]   He sounds like a hero. That sounds like a kind of curtain, right? The queen looks good.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.040]   Like this guy saved everyone from a terrorist, but he also sort of had a dark pass. That seems
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:53.280]   like a nice story, right? It's a different- It gives off a very different image to the public,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:39:00.720]   that can happen on a rare occasion that somebody did something for the public goods saved lives.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:08.240]   It's not what the queen does much more regularly would be issue knighthoods in the new year to
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:15.280]   people who have done great. So that's- It's more that she will reward people for goods rather than
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:22.160]   offer clemency on a routine basis to people who may or may not have been wrongly convicted or-
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   Here's a Washington Post article that says, "Just about every country has a pardon power,
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.280]   but actual use of it varies all over the place. The pardon power in the U.S. actually comes from
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:40.560]   the monarch's pardon power in Britain. Queen Elizabeth has used the power in the past three
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:46.080]   decades, largely in posthumous cases. The one I remember is Alan Turing, who she pardoned,
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:51.040]   remember, posthumously. Yeah, and the Prime Minister's office apologized.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:57.600]   And very appropriately, and that's thanks to John Graham Cumming, who is a good friend of the
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.800]   network and at CloudFlare, and he launched a campaign to get Turing- get an apology from the
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.520]   British government, which was successful, which I think is great. You know what the queen's
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.600]   the queen's pardon is called though? No. It's not called a pardon. It's called the
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.240]   Royal Prorogative of Mercy, which is just such a rock and roll way of saying-
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:25.680]   Queen, may I have your Royal Prorogative of Mercy, please? Wow, Mercy flows from the monarch.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:37.840]   She pardoned? I don't think we get a lot of those in France. It didn't make a big
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:46.160]   impression on me anyway, so it's not as flamboyant as the queen or even the U.S. president, I think.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:52.000]   The King of Thailand pardons half or a third of the prison population every year on his birthday,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.200]   but that's mostly because they have no parole system and a well overcrowded prison system.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:03.280]   So yeah, this is not actually as unusual as I thought it was, but
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:11.920]   pre-partons are rare, pardoning somebody before they commit a crime, and that's something I think
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:18.000]   was considered too. Can I say one last thing on this? Yes. On the knighthood thing, so we have
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.920]   that too, it's the National Medal of Freedom. I thought it was hilarious because it usually goes
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.760]   heroes, civil rights heroes. People have done really great things as a congressman or something,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.560]   but Trump has given way more of them to sports players and athletes.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:40.080]   I had dreamt last week that maybe a time would come when we wouldn't have to use the word Trump
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:46.320]   in a sentence for a while, but I guess for a few more weeks we will mention that because it is,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:56.320]   it's still going on. Google is again, and Google is just, it's not been, it was a no good very bad
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.440]   year for Google and they're in trouble again. You may remember they fired or forced the exit
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:08.160]   of Timit Gebru, who was a AI researcher. They had brought in to lead the AI ethics team,
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.680]   and that was kind of controversial. Now they're investigating her colleague, Margaret Mitchell,
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.760]   because Mitchell had been using an automated script to go through her messages to find
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   examples showing discriminatory treatment of Gebru. Google locked her account saying,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.600]   well, they didn't fire her, but they locked her account saying they're investigating why she
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:40.640]   downloaded a large number of files and shared them with people outside the company. I understand
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   that's probably an automatic process at a company like Google. Nevertheless, maybe they should start
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:54.000]   thinking a little bit about the optics of all this. I think it really shows how hostile the
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.360]   relationship has become Google between Google and a small fraction of its workforce. I think
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.160]   that that's really what's going on here. This employee clearly feels very upset about what's
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.480]   happening at her workplace. I think that in Google's defense, I think that this behavior
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.440]   without any context is the kind of thing that you would lock an employee's account for. This is a
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.760]   basic security measure when you see an employee downloading all sorts of stuff, especially in a
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.680]   large organization like Google. They've been caught a couple of times. As Amazon, some of these other
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:32.960]   companies are taking what are framed as apolitical actions when what's going on here is they are
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.600]   fighting back. The problem is that it's in the company's interest to protect whatever incriminating
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.960]   evidence might be within the company. I don't know. I think it really just shows that the
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:51.520]   hostility is really high. It's really not a good... I shouldn't say poor Google, but boy,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:58.160]   because they brought this. This is all self-inflicted. This has not been a good year for Google at all.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:04.560]   They just scrubbed on here. How can I just ask? On the issue here was the issue that the
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:14.000]   the woman in question was using a script or an AI to mine data for evidence, keywords,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.040]   or other data sets, or was it that the data on the whole was being shared outside of the
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.920]   company walls? I think it's probably a common... A little of both, but certainly sharing it outside
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:35.360]   the company's got to be a big red flag. When you see a lot of internal information being exfiltrated
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.520]   from any company, I think that's going to trigger an immediate investigation and lockdown.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.080]   There's also a lot of surveillance inside the company. I remember a few years ago,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.760]   I don't know if you guys remember the Google memo, but when I was working on that story,
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.120]   there was a lot of consideration inside the company about when you open a Google Doc,
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.080]   which is what the memo was, you can see everyone who's gone in and out of it. It was really hard
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:03.600]   to get that memo because it was very clear to them that the company was just watching that document
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.800]   and what was happening to it. I think this is fairly known inside the company that they're
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:16.160]   watching, sort of your every move, which is not uncommon. Speaking of Google, Alphabet is popping
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:28.720]   its balloons. This is the Google, the alphabet that I kind of cherish and love. The wacky,
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:37.280]   let's try it. Let's see what happened. The project Loon, which was named partly because they were
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:44.160]   balloons, but I think also partly because it was a little loony, was one of their moonshots. The idea
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:54.960]   to put high atmosphere balloons all over the world to distribute the internet. It launched in 2013.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:02.160]   It never really had a chance of making any money. By 2018, they'd graduated from Google's X,
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.760]   which is their moonshots, and it was made a division, one of Alphabet's other bets. That's
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.680]   actually the beginning of the end because now we're starting to see how much this is costing.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:18.080]   It got its own CEO, got some outside funding, and there were some uses of it. You may remember
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.920]   in Peru after an earthquake, they put the balloons up there to provide internet. Puerto Rico after
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:30.080]   Hurricane Maria. Last year, there was a pilot project in Kenya delivering bandwidth.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:38.720]   But Astro Teller, the appropriately named head of Google X, and also the chair of the Loon board,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:46.960]   he killed his own offspring. He recommended Alphabet no longer funded, and no one else was
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:54.640]   interested in picking up the mantle. Astro said, "This was a long shot. Even when we started it,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:03.440]   he gave it about a 1% or 2% chance of succeeding." I think partly the fact that Elon Musk's
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:10.880]   Starlink satellites are going to do the same thing better. They're already going, and just the
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:18.400]   whole idea. They learned a lot, but it's over for Loon. I think they're seeing the writing on the
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:27.040]   satellite wall between Starlink, which is starting to actually be commercially usable, even if it's
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:34.240]   in beta. It seems that these solutions are providing, are filling the need that Loon
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:41.680]   was addressing, and much more. If it works, you really don't need Loon. It seems like it does
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:49.440]   Loon works. Technically, it works. You don't need Loon. Also, Facebook had a similar idea with
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:58.240]   drone planes. Aquila. Which sounds like a killer, but these weren't killer drones. It's actually
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:05.920]   Latin for Eagle, I think. They killed that a couple of years ago. I think Loon also is just not really
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:12.960]   as innovative as it seemed to be. Even though the balloons were really cool. It was expanding
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:18.800]   existing sound-town coverage, which is very different from Starlink, which is like satellites
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.640]   that are beaming down the coverage to areas that don't already have it. That's why Loon was so
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:26.800]   great in disasters, because it was like, "Okay, the fiber is down, so you're going to use these
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.520]   balloons instead." It was mostly areas where there was already fiber coverage, because they were
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.600]   just expanding that a little bit. It wasn't this, "We're going to bring it to the masses who don't
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:42.560]   have any tower nearby." I think that was part of it. We read a really fun story about how the
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.840]   balloons were going down in Uruguay, which didn't even use them at all, but they were falling into
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:56.320]   real, real, re-work while the time. Stephen Levy writing in Wired talked about the fact that in
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:08.720]   the decade that Loon's been around, internet access globally went from 75% to 93%. He also says,
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:14.640]   and I don't know if this is Levy editorializing or if it's true, "The remaining 7% are primarily
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.960]   populated by either those who can't afford the 4G phones you need for Loon signals or aren't convinced
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:27.360]   that the internet was worth the effort." Just internet abstainers.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:34.480]   Teller came to realize Loon was unlikely ever to contribute to Alphabet's profits. But Teller
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.920]   said, "It's not a failure." He said, "It was a successful experiment."
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:47.520]   Levy asked him, "What's an unsuccessful experiment?" Teller said, "The real failure is when the data
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.960]   tells you what you're doing isn't the right thing and you do it anyway." So the success of this failure
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   was to call it. He's stopping. That's the success. I actually can believe that in a way. I feel like
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:08.800]   all the best lessons I've learned as part of my career, I've learned as a result of screwing
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   something up and not doing it twice. I think failure is a fantastic teacher, certainly has been for me.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:24.080]   So I buy this. I think the analysis is accurate that this is just maybe something that could have
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:32.000]   worked earlier, but it's too expensive to deploy, to maintain. It doesn't impact the bottom line so
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.240]   much. But I do still think there's something in this idea of balloons and temporary internet access.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.400]   As you said, Louis, in disaster zones, in places with natural disasters or something else where
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.440]   connectivity is cut off, anything that you can rapidly deploy can be massively beneficial.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:57.520]   I think it's Vodafone. This must be going back 10 years, but they had a backpack, like a 3G
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:04.800]   cell tower backpack that someone would literally wear on their back and carry around to increase
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.000]   cell connectivity in areas hit by natural disaster. So there's a genuine need for these
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:18.640]   sorts of rapid deploy, but rapid retrieval things to be in existence, but just maybe not on the
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   scale that Google thought it could do with this. Will Rogers said it best, if you find yourself in
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:32.720]   a hole, stop digging. So there's apparently a few dozen loon balloons still floating around.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:38.000]   They're going to try to bring them in and lay them to rest, but that's it for Project Loon.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.800]   Oh, such a lot of hot air. Yeah, there are a lot of puns right there.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:52.240]   All right, let's move on to Apple. We're going to, we're going to,
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:59.440]   Apple stock went through the roof on Friday. That's the other, that's another adage. You buy on the
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:07.520]   rumor, you sell on the news. They're buying on the rumor because it is thought that Apple will have
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:14.880]   amazing, maybe it's best fourth, a first quarter ever when they announced their results this coming
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:21.200]   Wednesday. It's expected analysts expected Apple's quarterly revenue for the quarter ending December,
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:27.840]   which includes the new iPhones, new Mac and Tasha's, new watches, new iPad, all new stuff,
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:33.760]   and of course new services, the Apple One plan. Analysts think that their quarterly revenue will
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:43.040]   be the highest of all time exceeding the $100 billion mark. And so Apple stock price at its highest
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:50.480]   ever. MagSafe, MagSafe. Are you hoping or did you, you're talking about the MagSafe on the iPhone
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:55.840]   12 or are you talking about the rumor that Apple's going to put MagSafe back on its laptops? Back
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.080]   at its laptops. I feel like that's the most important thing. I'm really excited as a dog owner,
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.800]   as a clumsy human. I'm just kidding that that was what drove the stock price.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.440]   But I do think that it seemed like there's some good Apple news and I'm happy to see the product
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:16.720]   direction that they're moving in now. On the MacBook, they're essentially going back,
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.920]   they're turning back the clock five years if the rumors are to be believed. They're removing the
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:31.360]   touch bar and getting MagSafe again and adding some IO. So that's, I don't know if there's something
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.880]   to be concluded. I think that's right. I think rid of the MagSafe originally, was that a fitness
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.920]   thing? Right? It was a compromise about fitness. They wanted to go to Type C, right? And so,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:47.280]   I think that there was a lot to be said for Type C. I hope they don't take out the Type C
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:52.160]   charging capability and have some proprietary charger again. I think that is a good point.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.400]   That's the wrong direction. But I think you can make a breakaway Type C charger of some kind.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.360]   I know you can't. Companies are doing it. Maybe that's what it is. They just didn't have that
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.920]   innovation yet. They've sort of been able to marry them together. But anyone's had their
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:13.840]   MagSafe. That's the question though. I don't have a dog, Louise, and maybe I'm not as clumsy as you.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.400]   I didn't like MagSafe. Really? Yeah. It's just too easy to disconnect.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:25.120]   Now, you need to work in more coffee bars. Yeah. That thing was just you're sitting in a Starbucks
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:30.720]   working on that screenplay, planning that podcast. Someone walks past you with two
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:36.560]   venti-americanos and you can kiss goodbye to that cable. Not just the cable. The whole
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:43.440]   laptop goes with it, right? It's flying through the air. Well, unless you have MagSafe. Yes.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.480]   Not only do they plan to drop the touch bar, which, you know what? Let's be honest,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:55.680]   that's as bad as Project Loon. It's time to stop digging that hole. They finally are getting
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.720]   rid of those butterfly keyboards, which are terrible. And yeah, you're right, Patrick. They're
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.640]   saying maybe we're good. This is the rumor. Mark Herman. He's usually pretty well connected.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.520]   Maybe this is a traveling. Maybe we'll put an SD card reader back. What do you think?
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:16.080]   I would love that. It doesn't tie into their services.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.200]   Doesn't make any sense. No. No. You look at the figures for Apple's last quarter and
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:27.280]   practically for the last three years and the growth in its services divisions and obviously
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:34.640]   with the recent or relatively recent Apple one as well, anything that doesn't tie into something
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:41.840]   that can either mean you need more iCloud storage or you need better abilities to share or other
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.240]   ways to share things with family or colleagues. It sort of feels at this point that if it doesn't
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:53.680]   tie into that in some way, then Apple doesn't have an interest in it. So I can't see that being
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:00.160]   brought back. That seems, I agree. It doesn't seem like it could be possibly come back.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:06.800]   I just want to like, is there enough complaint from their core user base because they really
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:13.600]   want to be the niche for creators? Is there enough, they realize that enough creators are
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:19.440]   moving away or very annoyed by that capability? That's the only reason I could see. You're not
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:26.560]   going to see a professional photographer put everything in the cloud. It's a really good point.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.480]   And definitely one of the arguments back at the time that it was removed was that not every
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.720]   pros don't all use SD cards. They were using compact flash and things like that. The technology
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:43.200]   has moved on a lot since then and now SD is just widespread. So arguably you could bring that back,
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.720]   but then if you're going to do that, why not do what Apple does very well and just force the
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:52.720]   industry to evolve and move everyone to micro SD? I know they're not as fast for the pros, but
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.520]   if you want a physical little thing to shove in the set of a laptop, then there are smaller
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:03.200]   devices out there than the SD card. I've got an SD card with Wi-Fi in it somewhere.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.400]   It's called an iFi, I think. Yeah, there wasn't a business, by the way, Nate.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:16.720]   Ben knows. Ben knows to buy an iFi. They're gone. I mean, Apple has driven the market for dongles
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:22.640]   like this. I mean, you know, I have a numerous dongles just because I do. I have an SD card
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:28.000]   in my cameras. All of them, and I pop it out and I have to have some way to read it and, you know,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.320]   I maybe they're, I don't know, I'd be happy. Maybe so we'll make Louise happy with MagSafe
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:39.600]   and I'll be happy with SD cards and nobody's going to miss the touch bar. I don't think that
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.360]   that really took off. No, I would love to read an article that's just an interview with people
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:51.920]   who love their touch bar. Oh, they're there. They're there. I'm sure they're out there.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:59.040]   I am actually, no, I don't love it. I just don't hate it. And I think that's the best you can get.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:04.800]   It's people who don't actively hate it. I'm like, yeah, it's fine. I don't use it. I use a better
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.080]   touch tool, which is a third party thing that actually makes it usable. And it's like a little
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:15.360]   display there. So I mean, it's okay. My big problem is I kept hitting it and things would happen.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.600]   Siri would pop up or my calendar. Siri is Siri popping up all the time.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.720]   So it works. But better touch tool lets you take all those away.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.080]   And then you can see time, day, weather, battery, things like that, which are, I guess that's
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:33.360]   marginally useful. I don't know. I mean, just to be clear, it's a rumor. It's not we're doing the
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.960]   you remember. It's not going to stay. In fact, I think it's not a completely credible rumor,
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.840]   even though it comes from the highly credible Mark Gurman.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:48.080]   Let's take a break. Then we'll talk about some new stuff coming along. Apple does,
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.520]   there seems to be some indication Apple will do some VR headset this year.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:59:02.960]   I don't know. That seems a little bit odd. Facebook has a big case going to the oversight board.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:12.800]   We will talk about that. And I don't maybe do a little TikTok too. And the Bernie Mittens meme,
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:18.160]   we got to that's the happiest story of the week. Are we sick of Bernie Mittens yet?
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.600]   Or is that no, no, can never get sick of that. People said they were sick of it about an hour
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:30.880]   after it started. But in reality, once it who doesn't love a picture of Bernie Sanders,
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:38.400]   all folded up with his big old Mittens. And it just happened that the photographer took it with a
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:45.120]   nice easy to edit white background. So highly memeable, although I've seen a lot of photographers,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:50.320]   including the one who took that picture said, I never ever want to take a meme picture. I hate it.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:57.200]   There's my picture everywhere, everywhere. Our show today brought to you by the folks
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:05.680]   at WWT worldwide technology. That was my last, I have a real fondness for WWT because that was my
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:11.680]   last time in an airplane back in March, not last forever. But for some time, I imagine.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.000]   Lisa and I flew out to St. Louis to see their advanced technology center.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.160]   Wow, this is something they began building about 10 years ago, started small one, a couple of racks,
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.000]   one building. It's now, I think four or five buildings, mile after mile half a billion dollars
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.320]   worth of equipment. See, WWT is a trusted partner for any big business for the technologies,
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.560]   for the consultants, the software design, they do so much. But one of the things they always want
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:46.000]   to know is they want to know how your stuff will integrate with the new stuff and so forth. So
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:54.880]   they bit this ATC, hundreds of OEMs, half a billion dollars of equipment ranging from the big guys
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:01.200]   heavyweights like Dell technologies and VMware and Intel to the little emerging disruptors that are
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.120]   changing the world like Equinix. WWT has been doing this for a long time, a trusted partner
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.040]   for so many enterprises. A lot of their customers have been with them for over a decade. They know
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.480]   WWT is the place to go to get the answers they need to make sure their businesses run right. The ATC
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:25.840]   is not only something the engineers at WWT use to spin up proofs of concept and pilots
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.880]   in their lab environment, but they also have set it up so customers can do it too.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:41.520]   On demand, scheduleable labs for WWT's customers. Things like Dell's VX Rail Power Store, Unity Power
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:48.800]   Max, Data Protection Central IDPA, these labs represent the newest advances in primary storage.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.480]   Hundreds of labs that you can schedule and use from anywhere in the world 24/7, it's lab as a
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:00.240]   service they call it, a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center where you can
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:06.720]   perform your own programmatic testing using that amazing ATC technology ecosystem.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   WWT's engineers work in this amazing place every day, beta testing new equipment, building
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.600]   reference architectures and custom integrations to help their customers make decisions and see

[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:21.280]   great home in St. Louis. And I want to go back. It was a really nice, nice trip. St. Louis is famous
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:30.080]   for toasted ravioli, which is unique. That sounds delicious. It actually is quite good.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:40.880]   You guys seem like your hip, your with it, your podcasters, you own your own life.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:50.000]   Let's go with yes. Have you played with Clubhouse yet? Last week, I Justine sent me an invite.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:57.120]   And I don't get it at all. They just raised, they have 180 investors. They just raised more
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:05.280]   money through Andres and Horowitz. Their valuation, they're a unicorn, a billion dollars, which is
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:11.040]   10 times more than it was from the previous round. Do you know what Clubhouse is? Louise,
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:17.200]   have you used Clubhouse? So I have not used it, however, to pull my rest of world angle. I was
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.840]   very interested to learn the other day that it's also taking off in Mexico and Nigeria and some
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:29.280]   other places. So they do seem to have a larger user base than I thought. Because it's all sort of
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:36.960]   invite only right now. And it felt like it's all VCs and startup. Yeah. So to be fair, Nigeria has
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:44.560]   really big techs in. And in Mexico, it's catching on amongst VC-ish people. So I do think that they're
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.600]   capturing the same types. I don't think it's attracting TikToks user base or anything like that.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.280]   But I was sort of surprised to hear that because it definitely has this reputation as sort of,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:02.800]   not the nicest people in Silicon Valley. Some of the loudest voices maybe love to go on there.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.560]   And it's sort of become like very, their reputation on Twitter, at least of Clubhouse,
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.520]   is that a lot of the conversations are sort of very SF-centric. But I think it's probably a wider
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.640]   platform than that. It's very buzzy. So doesn't surprise me. It's so buzzy. Yeah.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:26.160]   I don't have an invite. And I was very jealous when Justine was- I will send you one, Patrick. I have
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:35.520]   a few left. Thank you. I'd love to give it a try, actually, because I think there might be some
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:42.880]   kind of logic behind the unicorn status. Everyone has seen what TikTok has done. And TikTok was
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.680]   really a different kind of social network. And Clubhouse is the only
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:54.880]   new/different thing that's happened in social networking in the past, well, five years, if you
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:00.960]   include TikTok. So I'm thinking there's a lot of people who saw what happened with TikTok and
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.040]   who are thinking, of course, it's not the same thing. But it's different from everything we have
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.200]   right now. And they're thinking we might not want to miss the boat on this one. Could be something,
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:17.600]   could not be. And of course, there are a lot of issues with moderation and stuff like that.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:27.760]   But it's definitely not something that we've seen in the past, ever. It's a different kind of network.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:33.360]   I don't get it. I'll be honest with you. It reminds me of the radio, though. It reminds me of people
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.080]   calling into radio shows. It's a little bit more dynamic than that. But I feel like there is sort
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:44.240]   of a precedent here for this sort of like kind of social interaction, right? It seems like an
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:49.200]   evolution of that, which is interesting. And I think potentially does have a lot of potential.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:56.080]   Anyone just like if with Twitter, anyone can be their own publisher, kind of, or Facebook.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:03.200]   This anyone can be their own radio show very easily. And even isn't Twitter kind of copying the
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:09.360]   functionality with spaces, which they're trialing now with actually minorities,
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.240]   which is probably a good idea because they want to catch the potential issues with the service.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:25.840]   But it's very easy. I find the valuation massively unsurprising because you've got a giant body
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:35.040]   of VCs and investors and people using this system already saying, "It's great." So, of course,
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.400]   they're going to throw a lot of money into it. It doesn't surprise me and the slightest.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   It's being propped up by the fact that the people investing in it are the ones who are using it.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.160]   It's kind of like, I don't know, the early days of Twitter felt like a similar sort of buzz that
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.320]   it was used by a lot of the people who are investing in it. But it does seem to be something a little
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.680]   different about it this time, just because it does seem to be spreading. And you're seeing new stories
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:05.520]   come out of things that happened in clubhouse. And that tends to be the point that I get interest
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.200]   in thinking, "Okay, is this more of a fad?" Like, "Hey, look at house parts. You remember house
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:15.040]   party? It's a big deal for a day because it offered a new way for people to communicate.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:21.840]   It was exciting, but it was not a sticky product. Where is it now, really? It's not at the top of
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.600]   the app stores anymore. That's for sure. Certainly not in the countries I've seen."
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:32.000]   That was also so based upon your own network. And I think that that social network we're starting
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.480]   to realize is really hard in the long term. Facebook's running into issues with that.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.280]   Snapchat is running into issues with that. Now they're trying to get creators. Again,
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.560]   I think ultimately to have a long-term successful platform, you can't just base it on people you
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.240]   know in real life. It's just not sticky enough and it's not going to keep people long enough,
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.640]   because they have other ways of talking to their friends and family.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.160]   I think that that's one reason that Clubhouse is a little bit more promising. But I do agree,
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.640]   who knows what's going to happen to you? I'm just too chicken to use it.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:07.680]   It is sort of intimate, right? I don't know. But the idea of turning on these freewheeling
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:14.160]   conversations is not inherently appealing. For people who don't know, so you go into Clubhouse
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.960]   and you get a list of... It's hard to describe. Audio rooms. They're like
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.280]   shavuums, but it's all audio. There's a moderator who's doing all the talking,
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.240]   but you can raise your hand and ask to be voiced and then you can communicate. Otherwise, you can
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:37.680]   listen. A lot of these rooms have hundreds of people in them, but you can't record it. It's not,
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:43.840]   it's live only. It's completely ephemeral, which I guess is part of the appeal to some of these
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.440]   to start up folks and VCs and stuff. In fact, that's one of the things I just
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.360]   said last week is you hear people being extremely candid because they know it's not recorded.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:10:00.080]   It's like Snapchat. It just disappears. Of course, as somebody in the chat room is
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.160]   pointing out, everything can be recorded. But you're not supposed to. And since your name is on it,
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.120]   maybe you don't want to.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.600]   It sounds a little bit like a podcast in a way. It sounds like an ephemeral podcast.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:23.760]   You can see me if I put my hand up and say, "I want to say something and interrupt you," then
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.600]   sometimes I do. That's okay because that's what we're doing here. It seems like
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.080]   is that not the same thing? For a different audience, obviously. But you could, theoretically,
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:40.480]   as far as I'm aware, you could set up a clubhouse and you could talk and listen to this good chime
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.600]   in. That's great. We know we want that. That's a cool idea.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.280]   But you could do it with discourse. There's lots of ways to do something like that.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:54.400]   I don't think the idea of audio conversations is what is making the product interesting.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:03.360]   It's the ease of use and execution. Just like with Twitter, you could send a message to someone
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.720]   or to several people in a myriad of different ways before.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.840]   Twitter didn't invent that. It's just the form that it took that was compelling.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:18.720]   And the ease of use was so that everyone started using it. So I think it would be a mistake to
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.920]   look at clubhouse and say, "Oh, but we can do that somewhere." I mean, I don't know that it would
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.200]   be a mistake. Maybe it is just going to go away because it's really not to create.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.080]   Maybe I'm just too old. I feel like there's a scale.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:38.080]   Of usability in these things. So if you go to Facebook, it's pretty clear.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.560]   Or Instagram is even clearer. I get it. I understand it. I know how to participate.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.960]   No big deal. Then there's Twitter, which I mean, I've been on it since forever.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:55.520]   But I think people looking at it go, "I don't understand." It's a little strange.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.680]   And then there's clubhouse, which is far on the end of that scale, which even maybe I'm just old.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:09.040]   I look at it and I go, "What? Huh? I don't want to sit and listen to somebody gas on for hours."
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.720]   Wait a minute. That's my show. Come to think of it. Never mind. Forget I said anything. It's a
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.400]   fabulous idea. Well worth the bill. Can anyone create a room, though?
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   Once you remember, yeah. You have to be, it's probably not.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:30.480]   Right. So that's very different, I think, from other forms of communication. It's Twitter for
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.640]   voice. And that's been kind of a fen- we have Twitter for photos, Instagram and many others.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:43.520]   We have just short messages. But for voice, that has never taken off anywhere. And if they crack
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.600]   that, I think there is value there. So I don't know. Let me tell you what I'm seeing.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.360]   Right now, Barret Tunday, who I actually love and would listen to,
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:58.480]   he says, "He's got 14 people listening, literally streaming Spotify daily mix while I work." Okay.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:07.360]   YouTube business, SEO and IG, there's 12 people in there, including people I know who are smart.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.040]   Oh, here's one. The power circle, secrets of the millionaire mind, master the game of wealth.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.400]   There's 831 people in there, including some people I know also.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:25.920]   Psychedelic clubhouse, invent, investing in psychedelics, the big opportunity. There's a lot
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.520]   of stuff like that. I mean, what was YouTube when it first launched? It was skateboarding,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.240]   dogs and what was Twitter when it first launched? I don't even remember, it was so memorable.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:46.400]   I don't think we should judge it by what it is now. And of course, if we knew it was going to
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:54.240]   be successful, we wouldn't be discussing the idiocy of yet another unicorn. But it is
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.080]   a bet, of course, and it could become something. You're our resident optimist today, Patrick.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:07.520]   I like you. I like to think of myself as a realist. I've read factfulness. It's an amazing book,
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:13.840]   and you have to look at things in a measured way and not in a negative way like everyone always does.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.160]   Good. Thank you. That's a good warning. In fact, here's a remark. If I weren't doing a show,
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.600]   I'd be listening to how to be successful on clubhouse, and there's 243 people there.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:32.480]   I don't know how to do an invite. I will figure it out. And I guess, send it to your email. I don't
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:39.680]   really know how this works. And at that point, I will understand why it's completely ridiculous.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.760]   And if you're really leading, if you're doing the Phileas Club live, I would go listen to that.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:52.480]   That would be great. Well, I mean, that makes me think of this chord, which maybe you mentioned
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.360]   before. Yeah, just of course, exactly the same as far as I could tell. Yes. And people
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:03.840]   watch stuff on this chord. I mean, gaming, we've already had all of the people making fun of,
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:09.040]   oh, you're watching people game. And that's we've had that round already. But if you go look at
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.600]   this point, some people watch stuff that you would never believe would get an audience.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:19.120]   No, that's an excellent one. We record my podcast text message. We record that on Discord live,
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.640]   and very occasionally we'll pull people in who are listening. Like literally the show I recorded
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.360]   this morning, we had a pronunciation of a Dutch website because there were people who were
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:36.800]   borrowing other people's dogs from a website that let you borrow dogs. So they had an excuse to be
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.160]   outside because of the strict Dutch lockdown rules. Oh, that's clever. That's so clever.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.720]   It's clever. But I'll be honest, that's not what my brother who I did the show with today
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.320]   described it. So it's worth a listen. But we pulled somebody in from who is listening live in the
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.160]   Discord to help us with some of the pronunciation. Yeah, because no one could pronounce Dutch,
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.640]   except the Dutch Dutch. So the situations like that is really handy just very quickly.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.960]   Pull people in if they've got some to say it for a pod as a podcaster. It's super useful.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:11.760]   I'm actually we're kind of exploring ideas for this. So it's an interesting I love,
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:18.080]   I have to say I see you're influencing me already, Patrick. I do love the idea of the internet trying
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.560]   new ways to communicate, not just kind of settling on the ones that already exist.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:30.400]   I think that's that's exactly what should be going on on the internet. So I apologize. And then
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:38.960]   there's parlor, which is it's kind of ironic. Is there I don't know. You did a story, Nate,
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:45.600]   that said that the parlor is reappeared. Well, with the help of Russia.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:52.880]   So I was doing some reverse DNS digging to try and figure out where the servers were. And I
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:17:03.200]   found that it was using a service called DDoS guard, which is operated by two Russian people,
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:11.360]   although the obvious I found was registered in Edinburgh. But what it seems to be, although it is
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:17.920]   that was accurate, DDoS guard isn't hosting. It's like a cloud flare equivalent from what I'm
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:23.920]   aware of. So they're using that, but it pointed towards the cogs working in the background to
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:31.440]   suggest things are moving. The domain also has moved. It's now being managed by Epic,
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.600]   but Epic with a K E P I K, which also is a registrar for
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:45.520]   Oh, gab. Oh, yeah. So like there's things moving that suggests it's on its way. But at the time of
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:52.720]   speaking now, parlor.com at least still says technical difficulties. It's a very similar
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.320]   message to what was on the other day when I was reporting this for Bloomberg. But yeah,
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:05.120]   I'm keeping my eye on it. I'm quite quite closely CEO John Mattsey, you quote saying from his post
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.400]   saying our return is inevitable due to hard work and persistence against all odds. That's a little
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.360]   bit of a change from his earlier story. I don't know how I'm going to get this back online. He
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.480]   says despite the threats and harassment, not one parlor employee has quit. We are becoming closer
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.240]   and stronger as a team here in our bunker. Oh, no, I added the bunker. I could believe that it's a
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.320]   small it's a small team. And I think it probably I think it probably will come back in some form.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.520]   The question will be initially whether it comes back in a way that preserves the historic content,
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.640]   you know, is it your same account? If you have a problem, can you verify? Pardon me. It's like
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.840]   to get back in. You forgot your password or we have to set up a new account. There's a lot of
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:51.040]   stuff like that that that may that may mean that it loses some of the buzz perhaps that it's
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:56.720]   that it had. But I do believe it'll probably come back because it had a lot of users. I'm still a
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:02.640]   First Amendment absolutist. I, you know, obviously the First Amendment doesn't protect incitements
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:10.080]   to violence or planning violence or violent insurrection or sedition. And the problem parlor had was
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.480]   that they didn't seem to be able to take that stuff down. But I think there needs to be places
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.200]   like Gab and parlor. I'm not going to hang out there, but I think everybody should have the right
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:27.520]   to express their opinion, right? Well, no, I'm sorry. Not everybody. It's you.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:35.120]   So this is by the way, this is the European versus the American debate.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:41.760]   Let me just go first. My, my, my, I'm sorry. It everybody you even you don't think everybody
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.120]   should have a right to express their opinion. If there is, you know, terrorism or a child of
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.200]   abuse, no, no, no, there are certain things that are illegal that shouldn't, you know, like
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:56.640]   incitement to violence or child abuse that absolutely should not be expressed. But if you want to say,
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:03.040]   I think President Trump won the election and it's a it's a damn shame that it was stolen from
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.440]   him, you should have the right to say that. I think you do. Do you don't have the right to say that?
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.560]   It's absolutely protected. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. The question is sort of like,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.600]   these platforms are given a lot of credit and these discussions. Like, let's look at what Parlor
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:23.040]   is, right? It was funded by, you know, a very politically oriented, conservative family.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:29.040]   They were collecting people's driver's license, you know, very sensitive information. You know,
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   is this really the free speech network that we want to be in a position of accepting? You know,
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.560]   it's like, I'm happy to talk about these things sort of like in an idealistic way. And I think
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.440]   that like, this is just the wrong example. And I know it's like, yeah, you want to use the hard
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.720]   examples, but I have so much more of a problem with governments wanting speech taken down that
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.920]   is, you know, a threat to their rule. There's just so many more pressing cases of this than
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:57.040]   Parlor. Like, Parlor, to me, it's just so obvious that, you know, I think they were trying to collect
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.520]   a bunch of data about conservatives primarily. It was really sensitive data. Like, what was the
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:08.320]   aim here? Was the aim here really to give people an alternative because Twitter is so, you know,
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.080]   authoritarian? Or was it to create sort of a safe space for conservatives where a lot of like,
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.920]   you know, marketing could be done for conservative causes? That's depressing. If that's the case.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.800]   I just, you know, it's hard to say. I just don't know. There's a lot of that in the world. Yeah.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.800]   And unfortunately, there's a lot of that in the world on every place. I just look at something
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.720]   like Mastodon or like some of these other sites like mines, like some of these other ones where
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.160]   I'm like, okay, it seems like more like the people behind this are really thinking about.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:42.240]   I love Mastodon. We have our own Mastodon instance, which I run called twit.social.
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:48.080]   And it's the only issue is I wish there were more people there, but it's a great place.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:53.280]   And by the way, GAB uses Mastodon. And on my instance, I block GAB because I don't want to,
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.920]   I don't want to get in that kind of conversation. But you can always go to GAB if you want on
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:03.120]   Mastodon. And they're probably plenty of people. And God bless the Mastodon enthusiasts. They are
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:11.040]   like this is it could create issues at some point, but it's a genuine effort. I think the bigger
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:20.240]   problem we're going to see with Parler is the same as with GAB and with, oh, what's the name of that
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:27.040]   Reddit alternative, like the free speech slash conservative alternative to Reddit? I'm sorry,
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.160]   I don't remember the name, but that's the thing. You don't even remember it either. The problem
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.760]   with these, these efforts is that they per train to be
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:48.800]   defending free speech. But really what they are, let's be honest, is enabling a pretty unacceptable
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:54.560]   kind of speech that would be banned everywhere else. And the real problem is there's no business
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.240]   model for that. They can't monetize. First of all, it's not interesting because they're talking
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:04.880]   amongst themselves. So they aren't very many that stay there because it's, you know, it's only-
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:09.360]   But Fox News monetizes, Breitbart monetizes. There are plenty of far-right
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.240]   journalistic- Yeah, but they're not. They're not that kind of far-right. I don't think-
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:19.840]   I think you can- Not extremist. Not extremist. Okay. Yeah, Fox News, you can, you can, you know,
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:27.520]   express those views on Twitter. That's, you can go there. The things that you see on GAB and on
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:34.880]   Parler, or maybe Parler is kind of a, you know, edge case because it was, it took rose to prominence
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:40.400]   during the last few months of the Trump administration. I don't think long-term that is a viable
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   business model. There's a viable business model behind that kind of a target. Maybe I'm wrong,
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:52.560]   but the history so far has shown that all of those things tend to go away, not because they're
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.600]   being censored, but because there isn't really anyone who wants to do business with them,
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.240]   and they don't have any other ways to monetize that. That was Mike Masnick's point on tech-
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:10.720]   dirty, says, "This isn't censorship. It's the free market weighing in on the viability of a product,
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:16.000]   and nobody wanted anything to do with it." So that's that. That's that. Yeah. I mean, I thought
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.960]   that was a good idea. I do feel sort of weird about AWS having a say in what
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.880]   of that. Well, that's right. I think there are problems with how Apple and Google have
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:32.960]   policed the App Store. We've seen Apple take down an app that raised awareness about how
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:39.760]   workers are treated in Foxconn. There are problems there with these systems, but I don't necessarily
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.160]   think, again, that these are the best examples, necessarily. I think that there's a genuine business
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.680]   reason to your point that they wouldn't want to work with these companies, and that sort of raises
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:52.960]   a lot of questions about, "Is this a viable business?" I mean, were you never going to get massive
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:59.200]   advertisers flocking to something like Parla? It was always going to attract more of a niche
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.840]   audience. We've seen that just when massive advertisers have pulled their campaigns from
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.440]   Facebook when they've seen that their ads were appearing next to something that promoted
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:16.320]   something awful or that was against their corporate values or whatever. But Parla was
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.840]   ad funded. That was their model, was too many of them ads. I wonder if that's at the point it does
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:30.720]   come back, whether it can self-sustain essentially as a donation-based system, because you've got a
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:38.480]   very loyal group of people who seem to really want this to exist. Maybe that's how it survives.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:42.880]   Maybe it just has to do everything itself, and the community wants it. If they feel
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.480]   so removed from some of these other platforms, maybe they're like, "Well, hell, this is the
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:54.080]   thing that we want, so we'll pay for it." Honestly, there's no stigma about not being able to
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:26:00.160]   self-fund through selling advertising. Absolutely right. Why not have a subscription? I think that's
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:08.080]   actually a completely honorable way to go. We're ad funded. But if something that wants to exist
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.480]   and people want it to exist, having them contribute a few bucks to keep it alive is,
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:18.800]   I think, a pure model. That's what GAP does. That is the GAP model on it.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.080]   Oh, is it really? I didn't realize that. Yeah, it's like a GAP pro version that that's how
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.480]   they're doing it. They've found a lot of alternatives. I'm not defending them necessarily,
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.600]   but I do think that that's fair. That's always going to be a niche approach. You're not going to
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.840]   scale that very, very far. I don't think. There's only a limited number of people who are
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.960]   willing to pay a monthly or yearly fee for that sort of access.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:47.760]   This is what I wonder about with Signal. I've become a massive Signal ad over the last few months.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:56.400]   Similar, they have designed themselves around the idea of being funded by a not-for-profit
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.640]   foundation that relies on donations. I was thinking, "Well, what's the good example of that being
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.920]   working well in these sorts of spheres?" Then I think Wikipedia has done quite nicely.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.560]   The Internet Archive has done very nicely. It can work. It can totally work if there's value.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.160]   I think that's what Paul is going to have to do.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:22.800]   It can. The issue you have there is that the target for Parler is people who can't express
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:29.840]   themselves on other platforms. It's the exact same service except for people who can say what
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:40.240]   they want to say on other platforms. My theory, and I think Mike Masnick's article was very close to
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:48.480]   that, is that this isn't really this big divide in the middle. It is because we have a complete
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:54.080]   statistical anomaly with what happened with President Trump's deep platforming.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:01.120]   That made a lot of noise. The reality of the situation is that that group that can't say what they want
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:08.800]   general platforms is very small. I don't think you're going to find a lot of—I would guess,
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.880]   maybe I'm wrong, but I would guess not a lot of them are going to be funding or donating to
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:19.440]   these platforms on the long run. I don't think there's a natural alliance between other groups
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:25.600]   that do have these problems. I don't think you see sex workers or you see activists who are often
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.520]   kicked off these platforms or have problems with moderation. They don't want to be in these
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.720]   platforms either. They're not necessarily just attracting the free speech people or the people
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:39.440]   who have grievances with the big platforms. They're attracting even a smaller subset of that.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:46.880]   An even bigger problem, I think we're going to see, is not Parler. What we're going to see is
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:54.960]   what actually Nate mentioned, things like Signal and Telegram and the other end-to-end encryption
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:01.760]   services, which are exactly, for example, which are going to have to start dealing. What's
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:07.840]   app they can kind of police things a little bit more easily. I think something like Signal is going
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:15.520]   to have a hard time moderating these groups if they start adopting Signal massively. I don't know
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.920]   what the huge problem for Telegram, right? Yes. Telegram, though, has a little bit more, I think,
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:28.880]   culpability in that, because the Telegram channels by default are not end-to-end encrypted. They have
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:35.120]   some dividend to them. Yeah, whereas Signal really is just like, we don't know what's going on in
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.840]   the platform, which I think is an existential question. It's unmoderatable, therefore.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:47.680]   By design. By design. But that's the point where we're going to start seeing in the next, I don't
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:56.560]   know, year to years, five years, encryption advocates and absolutists who might have to start thinking
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:05.680]   about that idea. Never. What's app has already had this problem? They've had this problem in India.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:09.840]   They've had this problem in places like the Philippines. What's app has done is they've made a
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.680]   couple of tweaks around the edges. They have limited the amount that you can forward
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:20.720]   messages, for example, since they realize that forward chain messages were a big sorts of this
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:26.080]   stuff. I think you can only work around the edges if you want to keep the end-to-end encryption in
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.600]   place. There's a lot of reasons for that. That's a really good point, because you're right,
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.040]   part of the reason that that was such a problem for WhatsApp is that it's so pervasive, and it's
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:44.400]   such a giant scale. There was no filtering in the way that posts sometimes just because of the
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.280]   algorithm that won't appear in your feed on Facebook with WhatsApp, you get everything. There's no
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.640]   algorithm deciding which messages from which people you get, you get everything. It had that
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:59.760]   power to spread, like, I don't want to use it like virus, because bad connotations run.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:05.120]   It's like wildfire, maybe. Not the greatest connotations here, either.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:16.720]   All right, it spreads very quickly. But that most platforms aren't at that scale,
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.560]   and so it will be interesting if something like Signal got to that middle ground,
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.440]   where it was big enough to be a problem, but not so big that they had to enforce something like
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.800]   WhatsApp did to keep it under control. But just one final thing that I wanted to mention on
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:41.920]   Parla will be a really interesting test case if it is possible for a very liberal or very left-leaning
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:48.400]   conversation or person or topic or something to rise to the forefront in that app,
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:54.480]   or whether it will just naturally and organically get buried simply because the people who want to
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.280]   use it don't want to read that stuff, or they want to push that kind of content down,
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:05.440]   disagree with it. It will be really interesting if we ever see a prominent liberal voice, I suppose,
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:11.440]   is what I'm getting at on Parla. They don't need it. They can speak on Twitter,
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.920]   and then you're going to have people who are going to say, "Oh, but see, that's proof of bias."
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:22.320]   But it isn't. It's society as a whole deciding what's acceptable and what isn't. That's exactly,
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:30.560]   again, getting back to that, Massnix point. It's us together. It wasn't Twitter and Facebook
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:36.320]   illuminities getting together in a room and saying, "We're going to ban this and this and this word."
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:42.800]   It looked like this in form because that's the way it happened, but it was really much wider than
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:51.120]   that. It was society saying, "All right, that's it. Now we say stop." And we was society that took
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:57.440]   the form of public pressure on many, many different companies that pushed that kind of speech to the
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:05.600]   edges. The left-wing prominent voices can still say what they want on Twitter, I think. It's
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   different. I'm all for both sides. Really, the Phileas Club is essentially a both-side
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.080]   podcast. It's very important to me, and it's very important that we listen to everyone. I think
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:22.640]   that's key to the future. But this, I don't think, is a you can equate the...
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.560]   Because these are private companies, they're just businesses. Is that why?
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:34.720]   No. What I mean is it's not when we take the example of, on those free speech platforms,
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.560]   will left leaning voices rise to prominence. I don't think they will because they don't need
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:46.960]   those quote-unquote free speech platforms. Those platforms are created to host speech that is
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:52.640]   unacceptable. Fringe speech. And those left-leaning
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:34:01.520]   figures can say what they want on the existing platforms, so they don't need to go there.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:09.440]   What about me, we? This is an alternative social network designed to replace Facebook.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.560]   Tim Bernese Lee, you were very much involved with it. And apparently,
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:20.160]   becoming a haven also for extremist far-right activity. Is there something about social networks
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:26.240]   that causes what's going on? Or, you know what's happened is you squeeze so hard on the mainstream
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.920]   networks that the jam is coming out of the sandwich and it's spreading to wherever it can flow.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:38.080]   Yeah, I think that's definitely what you're sort of seeing here. I also think that there is
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:44.320]   some sort of over coverage to some degree because these are the people who are getting kicked off
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.160]   that are getting a lot of notice. They get pressed. So it doesn't mean it's a big deal,
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:54.640]   it's just getting coverage. I mean, I think it is a big swath of users. It's like, I think Twitter
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:02.480]   kicked off 70,000 QAnon people one day. That's a sizable chunk of people. It's a little disturbing
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.240]   that there was that many accounts that they could automatically identify as being associated with
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.000]   QAnon, but that's sort of a separate topic. So I do think there is sort of a big base, but I do
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.360]   think there's always some people who are looking for another place. It's just that this purge also
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:20.640]   happened to be occurring to your point, Leo. I think that the sandwich was getting squeezed.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.320]   It's a terrible metaphor. It's a terrible metaphor and I totally apologize for it, but
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.600]   it's apt. It's apt. Thank you for defending my crappy metaphor.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.360]   What is now Facebook? This is what, by the way, the oversight board was invented for.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:44.800]   Facebook of all of these companies can say, well, we're going to deplatform the president,
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:52.000]   but indefinitely on Facebook and Instagram, but we're going to refer it to the Facebook oversight
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   board. And of course, they have no, they can say whatever they want. It doesn't force Facebook to
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.080]   listen to it. It really is a mechanism for deferring responsibility. The Facebook oversight board
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.960]   has agreed to take it. I don't know how long this is going to take. Its decisions, they say,
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.840]   are binding and cannot be overruled by Mark Zuckerberg. I don't know. Is that the case?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:26.880]   Reminds me of when they did the voting on the privacy policy updates. They said that
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:35.440]   if certain things got a high enough engagement from users, that it could force a review or a
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:41.280]   change or something like that. But I don't think enough people ever actually cared enough for it
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.880]   to tip the threshold of, tip the balance. So I don't know why something like this would be any
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:51.440]   more effective than that. It's just, as you say, it's batting responsibility. It's going to slow
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:58.960]   down decisions, presumably. It seems like a strange decision. But I assume I also think it's strange
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.960]   because I don't fully understand it. And I'm very aware of that. Maybe one of you guys do.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.640]   I think the way that this works is it's always an appeal. I think it's always a decision that
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:14.240]   Facebook first made that then gets referred to the oversight board. So I think that that's why
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:17.920]   it happened afterward. And I do think this is going to be fascinating because Techter did a really
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:24.960]   good experiment a while ago where they asked a bunch of content moderation experts about what
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.560]   they thought about various decisions. And I think that the way that that sort of shook out is that
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.640]   they had different answers, like people who specialize in this stuff, which points to the fact that
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:38.320]   there is sort of no right and wrong answer. And I would love to sort of just see their responses
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.160]   and whether there are disagreements. Because I think that the common wisdom here is that this
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.480]   was the right move. Maybe it was a little too little too late. But I would like to see sort of some
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.520]   flesh out arguments on both sides because I think that this is a complicated question that
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:56.400]   does set precedent for what Facebook will do in the future, especially in the rest of the world.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:04.240]   So I am really curious what will happen. So according to the board, they are binding,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.400]   although honestly, nothing's binding if Mark doesn't want to go with it.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.160]   In the coming-- It's crazy because the account back. Yeah, I mean, it would be embarrassing to
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.480]   overrule it. So in the coming days, according to the board, the case will be assigned to a five-member
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.440]   case review panel. After the panel reaches a decision, its findings are shared with the entire
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.880]   board. Then a majority of the board will have to sign off for the case decision to be issued.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.320]   Mr. Trump, through his designated page administrators, will have the ability to submit a
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.680]   statement to the board explaining why he believes Facebook's content moderation decisions should
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:45.040]   be overturned. Facebook will also share contextual information and an explanation.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.520]   What they're reviewing, though, is kind of constrained. They are reviewing
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:59.520]   whether there was a violation of Facebook's own policies. In other words, they can't just say,
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:05.120]   "No, no, no, you should put him back." The members will decide whether the content involved in this
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.560]   case violated Facebook's community standards and values. They will also consider whether Facebook's
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.080]   removal of the content respected to international human rights standards, including freedom of
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.280]   expression and other human rights. So there is a kind of a framework for them to interpret this.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:27.680]   They say they're going to move as promptly as possible. There's a 90-day limit. So I don't know
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:33.040]   what that prompt means. Following publication, Facebook will have up to seven days to implement
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.560]   the decision. They also have to respond to any recommendations within 30 days.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:46.000]   I think in a way this sounds sensible. There's lots of issues with the oversight board. They can't
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.960]   review very many cases. There are millions that would like to be reviewed. They did pick good
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:57.200]   people to do it. I think I'll be interested to see what they say.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.360]   I think it's not an ideal solution, but once again, we don't have a better one.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:11.840]   We have a lot of critics, but very few people are actually saying, "That's the way we should do it."
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:18.000]   And the oversight board isn't... I genuinely think it's the best
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:26.960]   hint of a path forward for these kinds of decisions. Now, of course, they could really make the decision
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:32.640]   either way. A lot of people are going to be happy about it. A lot of people are going to say that
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.840]   this is the worst decision ever made, or that they were in the pocket of Zuckerberg getting
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.280]   away from the get-go. I would be very surprised if they overturned it, but who knows?
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:49.440]   All right. Let's take a little break. We've got a great panel. I don't want to exhaust you,
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:56.240]   because it's late at night, both in the UK and Finland. So we're going to... Please, we're moving
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:01.760]   through this as quickly as possible. Nate Langson is here. He is a tech editor at Bloomberg,
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.280]   host of the UK Tech Show. Wonderful to have you, Nate. If you want to do a little
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:13.040]   parodiddle on your drums, please be my guest anytime. Also joining us, Louise Mazzakis from a brand new,
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:21.440]   well, to me new. It's been around for nine months. Publication, rest of world. The global
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.680]   tech stories that get underreported in the US and Europe. I think this is great. Restofworld.org.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.440]   It's great to have you, Louise, and my friend, not Patrick, from notpatric.com.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:39.680]   There's so many podcasts, the Philly is club. If I go to notpatric.com, all of them will be there,
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:46.720]   right? Yes. Absolutely. Everything I do. We had a fun week this week on Twitch. We've actually
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.240]   prepared a short movie to help you. If you missed anything, get an idea of what you might have
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:58.800]   missed. Watch. This was from this morning. Bernie sitting wearing these mittens, and now they're
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:06.480]   putting him everywhere. Look at it. He's actually sitting behind Jeff. Previously on Twitch.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:13.280]   Hands on tech. Retro video game consoles are pretty awesome, but I just got the one that I've
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:18.960]   been anticipating the most. I'm going to review the C64 by RetroGans next.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:25.680]   Windows Weekly. I am getting more and more excited about Windows 10X.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.640]   I think a better name for this would have been EJOS. It really would have been.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.120]   Oh, interesting. Yeah. Like Chrome OS. But then, oh, it's not just like Chrome OS. It's not as good.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.000]   See, that's the problem. So this week in Enterprise Tech. In Parlor's case, I think it's a case of
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:49.920]   not being as concerned with privacy as they said they were, and not being nearly as skilled at
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:56.480]   programming as they should have been. How many of you remember that IT guy for Jurassic Park?
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:01.520]   I think our friends at Parlor were building Jurassic Park on cheap. What do you think?
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:07.680]   Twitter. Line 10. Print. I love Twitter. Line 20. Go to line 10.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.040]   You know, there are not many places you'll hear some basic programming in the promo.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:19.520]   Thank you, Jim Cutler. The great Jim Cutler, our official pro bono, Voyo guy.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:24.480]   Does a great job. Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com. One thing we learned last year,
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:31.440]   the internet is even more awesome, more useful anyway. If you can't go to the grocery store,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.280]   buy groceries online, can't watch movies in the theater, watch movies online,
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:39.440]   can't go to the doctor, visit the doctor online. And of course, if you need Stamps,
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.760]   you don't have to go to the post office. You can go to Stamps.com. We've been using them for years.

[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.600]   about that in a second. But let me tell you what Stamps.com does. It allows you to do all your

[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:17.040]   or office or home office. You get all the services of the US Postal Service at your desk. And by the
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:23.760]   way, now UPS, the United Parcel Service as well. And you get big discounts on both,
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.760]   both on mailing and shipping rates, whether you're a small office, just sending out brochures or
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:33.520]   invoices at an online seller, shipping out orders, even a giant warehouse, sending thousands of
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:39.280]   packages a day. Stamps.com can handle it all with ease. They don't just print out stamps.

[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.080]   ready, you just schedule a pickup or you could drop it off in a mailbox and boom, you're good to go.
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:10.800]   The discounts are really mind bending with stamps.com five cents off every first class

[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:13.040]   I love the post office. I'll probably go in and wave at them and say hello, but when I need postage,
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:19.040]   I'm going to use stamps.com. You should too. Stamps.com, please use that offer code TWIT so they know
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:27.760]   you saw it here. stamps.com. Thank you stamps.com. Big quarter for Netflix. What a surprise, right?
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:35.040]   I mean, that's all we're doing is watching Netflix, big subscriber growth. I didn't realize how big
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:41.920]   Netflix was internationally. I should have known, but the growth was even greater worldwide,
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:51.120]   the subscriber growth in the US and Canada and around the world, 200 million paid subscribers.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:58.320]   It crossed 100 million two years ago. Now it's a 200 million, and even more importantly, I didn't
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:04.560]   know this. Netflix, for the first time ever, has enough money. They don't have to borrow to continue
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:10.960]   operations. Did you know they were borrowing to keep it going? They're going to be free cash
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:18.080]   flow positive. That's the term they use. They won't have to do any more borrowing. They do have a lot
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.720]   of debt, but they'll be able to pay a lot down. They've borrowed $15 billion since 2011.
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:31.040]   But isn't that amazing? I had no idea. They have a $8.2 billion cash on hand though. So
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:38.160]   this is good news, good news, even with the face of competition from Apple TV and Disney Plus and
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.680]   Discovery Plus and HBO Max on it. Go ahead, Nate.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:48.400]   It's definitely a sign that that original content strategy works and has worked for them.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:56.400]   There was a lot of comparisons to HBO initially and how that worked very well for HBO.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:04.320]   But it seems like such a long time ago that whenever you thought of Netflix, the only show
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:10.720]   that came to mind was either House of Cards or Orange is the New Black. For the longest time,
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.280]   they were among the only original pieces of content that you had on Netflix.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:22.240]   When was the last time anyone described Netflix as being the kind of bargain bucket of video rentals?
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:27.600]   It's certainly how we used to describe it here, that if there was nothing else that you wanted
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.040]   to watch, you'd go to Netflix. It was all junk, but it was fine, because sometimes you're in the mood
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:38.560]   for junk. It's so not the case anymore and hasn't been for years. It's amazing. So
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:41.920]   unsurprising, but now there's a lot more competition.
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.160]   Well, and another testament to their success is the fact that every other streaming service is
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:52.480]   copying it. HBO Max when AT&T bought Time Warner or Warner Media, whatever it's called,
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.960]   the new guy came in and said, "We're going to be more like Netflix."
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:05.120]   We've got a really interesting situation in the UK where we've got both our state broadcast to
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:11.760]   the BBC, as well as a couple of the commercial broadcasters, including ITV, that have teamed up,
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:16.160]   even though they're technically commercial rivals, they've teamed up to launch a streaming service.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:22.720]   It's called Britbox. I subscribe and love it. Okay, interesting. I'm in Britain and I don't.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:28.400]   You don't need it. This is the thing, but they push it at us. They're really sign up for
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.920]   wireless phone plans. Often, it's Britbox is an option right up there with Amazon Prime or
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:39.680]   Disney Plus or something. I have used it, but I let a trial lapse because I just wasn't watching
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:47.120]   enough on it. But the fact is, is that that's the kind of competition that Netflix's success has
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.520]   forced in regional markets. I say regional markets, one regional market, but I imagine similar is
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.800]   playing out in other parts of the world as well, that maybe Louise is more familiar with than I am.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.760]   But that's the kind of thing that's actually been very good for everyone as far as making
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.160]   content available is concerned because we've just got decades of shows that you cannot buy.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.160]   You can maybe download them or get them on YouTube somewhere, you know,
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.600]   bit of a gray area. But it's it's for some to go through these archives, bring stuff back,
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.240]   and there's some great TV shows that I've watched that I never would have even known about,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.400]   let alone had access to. And that's a byproduct of Netflix's success.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.720]   Well, and the other thing Netflix has done well is they're buying international stuff and they're
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:38.080]   showing up as Netflix originals. But something like Berlin Babylon, which is produced in Germany,
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.520]   is such high quality content. Yeah. And we wouldn't see it otherwise. I don't think in the US.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.720]   Yeah, I think so that brings up a really great point, which is like, what don't you see
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.760]   when things are not on Netflix? Right. So one thing I worry about with Netflix, you know,
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:00.000]   Amazon studios, these big international companies with gigantic international presence is kind of
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.240]   being, you know, some of the only buyers of original content. Like I look at what happened
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.360]   with the dissident, right? This, you know, extremely acclaimed documentary by a very famous director,
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.880]   but it's about what happened to Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia. Right. So, you know, a lot
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:19.200]   they had a really hard time getting that bought, right? And this is an Oscar winning documentarian.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.080]   You know, of course, documentary is always going to be a little niche. It's not going to be the
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.680]   house of cards. It's not going to be the orange, it's a new black, but I do worry when there's only,
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.240]   like, you know, I'm really in favor of things like Britbox, because, you know, that's the kind of,
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:34.080]   you know, more niche carrier that I think would want some of the stuff that, you know,
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:39.200]   maybe Netflix doesn't want to touch because Netflix wants to keep gaining new users where it can,
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:43.040]   right? Like that's sort of the problem when you're that big is that you need to please everyone.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:49.520]   And we've seen all of these big streaming companies, not one stuff that's not kind to China, right?
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:53.840]   You know, Apple won't touch that. You're never going to see sort of a critical movie about China.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:58.400]   And that's also true of, you know, in big box offices. So that's what I worry about with these
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.120]   companies going really global. So I want more stuff like Britbox. I want some of these local
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:08.480]   players. Yeah. Yeah. And like, you know, Netflix tries to be, but they're never going to pick up
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:12.640]   the really niche stuff. And I want them to and I want there to be stuff.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:16.080]   That's why I subscribe to Britbox and the Criterion channel, which has a lot of
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:22.640]   art house films and things like that. Criterion's great. Yeah. But it's amazing hearing Louise
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:29.280]   described that because you can use the same description as we did with parlor and Twitter.
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:36.960]   It's like Britbox is the parlor of video streaming. It's a place where the niche domain of the show
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:43.040]   title, that'd be all. But you know what I mean? There's problems with monopoly, right? And I think
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.000]   that that's right. You're picking up on it. That's right. There's definitely problems with
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.280]   monopoly and there's problems about content. But you know, I do think there's a little
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:55.040]   difference between like, I think, Netflix and, you know, Apple's new, what's it called, Apple TV.
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.560]   You know, they don't want to be blocked in some of these countries. And that sort of seems like a
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:02.400]   slightly different political calculus. But I do hear what you're saying. It's like, I think that
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.120]   there's, you know, downside to these companies getting too big. Well, but there is an upside,
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:13.040]   which is for years, part of the problem was regional content restrictions. And all of this
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:17.360]   streaming has really broken that down now. You still see that though. Like if you try to use
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:20.880]   Netflix in the UK, there's certain stuff that's going to be blocked because of like, you know,
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.480]   whatever. But there's ways around it. Yeah, there's more ways of
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:29.920]   monolithic. So it's good not to it's, I think there is, they really actually, that's a very
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.800]   interesting point you may, because in the same way that there's monolithic big tech companies
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.160]   dominating social media, I guess there's monolithic streaming media companies. But it's
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:46.080]   important to keep this, as you say, Louise, keep these small niche companies around so that we
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:52.240]   get to see more variety. I think it's crazy though, to see like basically big tech has taken over
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:57.520]   crime right now, right? Like they've taken over big Hollywood in a lot of ways and they control
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:01.200]   so much more because like, you know, I think for any emerging filmmaker at this point, like
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:05.440]   getting a deal with Netflix is the dream, right? And that's kind of crazy when you think about it.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:12.480]   Like, yeah, used to be HBO. Apple's hoping it'll be Apple someday. It's interesting. Yeah.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:16.800]   Netflix's biggest problem, apparently, is people can't figure out what to watch. They're
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:21.440]   introducing a feature. I already got it called shuffle play. You press a button and it just picks
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:29.120]   something random. I love how it is. Is it random? Or is it? Well, they say it's based on what you
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:34.160]   what your interests are. I haven't pressed it enough times to know how totally ran. I mean,
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:39.360]   what I got was pretty mainstream. It wasn't like, oh, here's a weird document or you never would have
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:46.080]   thought watching. Do you know what? Do you like the idea? I never know what to watch. Right.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:52.400]   I absolutely love it. And for quite a while, quite a few years ago now, at this point back when we
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:57.440]   had, you know, media, well, some people still do have media servers under the cabinets, but
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:05.280]   I used to have a bunch of stuff that was entirely legitimately ripped from DVDs, etc.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:12.240]   That I would just have cycling through so I could switch TV to a channel on and just watch
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.400]   whatever happened to be playing because it was just all my own stuff, 10 minutes here,
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.120]   five minutes there, whatever. And that was really great. But that doesn't exist anymore because all
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.560]   of my consumption is from cloud stuff. So I really like this idea. But what I specifically
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:33.200]   want is to be able to make my own playlist that when I press play, it's only shuffling stuff that
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:40.960]   I've added into a playlist because that way I know what I'm getting. This is to be the entire
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:47.040]   catalog. Is that flick's going to become more and more like Spotify? So you have that's an
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:55.200]   interesting idea. Yeah, that's what I'd want. Yeah. I have clever idea. Cruise, the self-driving
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:02.480]   vehicle startup from GM just did another round of investment. Two billion dollar round,
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.840]   Microsoft was one of the investors. We don't know how much, but the thought is about half a billion
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:16.400]   dollars. Its valuation now 30 billion dollars. These cruise vehicles are driverless. They don't
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:24.880]   have a safety driver even. It's just like a living room on wheels. And GM is putting a lot of
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:29.120]   money into this. It'll be very interesting to see where they go.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:37.040]   Would you drive, Louise? Would you, if you called a cab or a Spotify or an Uber and it
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:41.520]   pulled up and there was nobody in it, would you hop in and take off?
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:48.880]   Yeah, I think I sort of trust the idea. I think that it's probably better than a normal driver in
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:52.960]   the long run. I think that there's a lot of problems with the technology that need to be
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:58.160]   hammered out. But I'm also not a good driver. I'm a huge advocate of public transportation.
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:02.560]   And I think I worry about in the long term how these things will be democratized.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:06.400]   Because I would like to see a world where we're all using cars less, not that we're using AI
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.320]   cars. So I do sort of worry about what's the path we're getting on. But I do think it's probably
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:17.280]   better. But I just worry like we're going to have this world where if you're a little bit richer,
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.600]   you get the AI Uber first and then everyone else is still using the normal bus and then public
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:25.040]   transportation is even more screwed. Like I want to like, where's the what about the AI bus?
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.920]   You know what I mean? Like that's what I want sort of first before the car.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.200]   That's a good idea. Yeah, I have to be like a little bit more like ensure that we're really
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.880]   supporting people. But you know, I would take an AI electric car that sounds like an improvement
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.000]   over what we have right now. Somebody saying that they should have a shuffle button in the AI
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.720]   cab that you just press a button. You don't know where you're going to go. You just press a button
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:54.080]   somewhere. Can you imagine like the restaurant saying to be part of that? Oh, that's a model.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.360]   Actually, let me do a restaurant. You do that with a cab. You say, what's a good restaurant in town?
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:03.120]   Take me there. He gets five bucks. You get a good restaurant. Maybe not. I don't know.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:07.360]   I think that there's, you know, that could be kind of fun. Honestly, I would like to see some of
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:12.240]   this like interesting AI personalization brought into the real world. Quote unquote.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.480]   I know they could do that with ordering services. They could do it today. Yeah, shuffle button.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:23.680]   Don't go to the restaurant. Just get surprise food. Shuffle button work. I don't know what I'm
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:30.400]   going to get. Just bring it to me. God, I hate that. I'm the worst, the worst food. Are you
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.680]   picking my order of burger? I don't want anything on it. And it never comes as plain as I want.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:40.160]   I don't want cheese on it. Get rid of that mayo. Get rid of everything. And they say plain. I say
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:44.400]   plain. They really play enough. Really? The burger comes and it's not plain. I'm like,
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:48.480]   I don't understand why you would want that. That's why. I know. And I know I'm the freak,
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:54.480]   but that's why I never I'd never press the shuffle button. Never press the shuttle.
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:02.480]   Yeah. Oh, Adobe flash is dead, but that's not necessarily a good thing, at least for one railroad
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:11.040]   in China. December 31st, Adobe killed flash, but I think they didn't realize that they would also
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:18.160]   kill the railroad system in northern China and Dali on it collapsed citywide for 20 hours.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:26.240]   Apparently the China China railway Shenyang was running on flash. They were using flash
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:34.880]   for train operation, for scheduling, for shutting. And when flash stopped working, so did the railroad.
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:41.680]   You would think knowing that flash was going away three years ago, they would have maybe
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:47.120]   planned better. Apparently not. However, good news. They were able to fix the issue
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:52.880]   by installing a pirated version of flash and they were back up running running the next day.
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:59.280]   Amazing. I love that. Speaking of China, you had a great story on, I didn't, I mean,
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:03.360]   who knew this? This is why I love rest of world because we're learning about stuff.
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:08.880]   The cutthroat war to dominate China's grocery delivery industry.
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:14.000]   Is there a grocery delivery industry in China? I'm kind of, I don't know why I'm surprised to
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.560]   hear that. Yeah. So, okay, follow me for a second. This is a really crazy model that like 100 million
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.960]   people plus are using in China right now. So, it's really big and it's really, really innovative.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:31.040]   And it's attracting sort of like grandma's almost like aunties, people who are really price conscious.
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:34.880]   So, imagine you have a group chat and all of your neighbors are in that group chat and you have
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.120]   sort of like, you know, maybe a local stay-at-home mom or someone, you know, maybe the
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:44.160]   local corner store owner, someone who, you know, owns a 7-Eleven and they are the moderator of
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.640]   that group chat. And every single day, they give you some crazy deals for fresh food.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:54.560]   And all you have to do is in that group chat, say what you want and the next day, the stay-at-home
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:59.360]   mom will get it all delivered to her place and then she'll bring it to you or you go pick it up
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:05.280]   at the corner store. So, they're called group buying groups. So, she gets everything and then
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:11.040]   parcels it out to the, to her neighbors. So, the like Uber, so DD, which is the Uber of China,
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:16.320]   is invested in this, you know, every 10cent, JD.com, Alibaba, all the biggest tech companies are
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:20.640]   investing in this all over the place. It's a huge frenzy to sort of like, get all these people,
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.720]   because to your point, these are people who didn't usually buy groceries online. They would just go
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:30.960]   to that corner store and get the stuff previously. But what this is doing is it's letting all those
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:36.800]   big tech companies cut a ton of costs. They get marketing from the stay-at-home mom. They get
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.960]   logistics. They don't have to go to each person's home, right? The stay-at-home mom will take care
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.040]   of that for them. So, the company makes money too, right? She gets paid.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:50.880]   She gets about 5 to 10 percent commission. So, she's incentivized to get as many people as possible.
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:57.280]   Most of these people have anywhere from a couple hundred to 900 people that they're managing. So,
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:01.520]   it's huge for them. And it can be, you know, it can be a big source of business for them.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:09.120]   And it's a crazy trend in China. And it's become really, really wild. Actually, two employees at
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:14.800]   one of the companies that has invested in this actually died recently, which sort of set off this
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:19.520]   huge reckoning about like, you know, are they pushing employees too hard at these companies?
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.440]   You know, is this frenzy worth it? The government is mad about it. But I love it because it's like
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.080]   stay-at-home mom selling vegetables. But everyone in tech is just falling over themselves over it.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:32.640]   Well, as you point out, it's in the article, it's highly customized because
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:37.520]   this one person who is managing this group gets to know everybody their interests,
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:42.880]   their tastes, what they want, what they don't like. So, it works, it sounds like it works really
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.800]   well, I have to say. Yeah, and like, come on, if you're like cute little neighbor, like,
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.480]   Texid, you have written, it's like, "Sail on carrots." Are you kidding? I would totally do it.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.920]   I would totally do it. Yeah, 50 cents for a bundle of carrots. Like, come grab them tomorrow
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:58.480]   with your eggs and your milk or whatever. Of course, I would do it. Do you think this model could work
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.360]   in the rest of the world? I think that like, you know, when I think about someone like my mom,
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.000]   who's like, not going to navigate Instacart, probably, but, you know, knows how to use iMessage,
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.200]   the thing is that it's integrated into WeChat, right? And we don't really have the-
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.600]   Yes, it is. --the high integration here in the same way. So, I think we're sort of far off,
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:20.080]   but I do think, you know, this is supercharged by the pandemic. There are way more people buying
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.800]   groceries online than there used to be. And I think that Instacart is like right for disruption.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.800]   I think that like, you know, Whole Foods delivery is not doing anything particularly
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.760]   innovative. And I think that even Amazon and some of these logistics giants are still really
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:37.760]   struggling with how to make a profit off of this. And these Chinese companies have sort of,
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.880]   you know, figured out a way to do it. Although, to be fair, they're offering really, really
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:46.160]   low prices, because these are really price-conscious consumers and suppliers are getting that,
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:50.640]   because they're like, you know, selling a bottle of cooking oil for like less than the actual,
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:54.960]   you know, cost to make it. So, there are a lot of sort of- It reminds me of when it was like
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:00.480]   $2 to take an Uber anywhere, because they were just pouring money on it and you get a 50% off lift
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:04.240]   ride. If you just open the Uber app and the lift app, you know, notice that you were doing that.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.560]   We all remember this. It feels like that. So, I do worry. It's sort of gimmicky.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:13.840]   Meanwhile, Instacart, which was bought by Uber, has announced they're going to lay off all their,
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:20.080]   everybody who works for them that voted for a union is fired. I thought that was illegal.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:26.000]   Wow. That's bold. That is bizarre. It makes me say I'll never use Instacart.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:35.440]   That's- I thought that- Where's the NLRB in this? That sounds completely illegal.
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:43.520]   All right. Nothing to say on that. It's up. Cool. And that's it. Yeah.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:45.680]   Yeah. Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. I don't know.
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:54.320]   Let's do one more quick break and then- Because I want to- I'm feeling really guilty
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:05:01.200]   keeping you guys up so late. But here's the deal. Today's advertiser is Casper.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:08.960]   So, this would be a good idea to kind of drows off to. Casper is, of course,
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:15.680]   a maker of the best mattresses in the world. Supportive, comfortable, but firm. It's hard to
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:20.560]   describe how it works, but it works so well. Mattresses that you sleep cool. They also have
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:24.560]   super soft betting. I just- My daughter just got a new apartment. I don't- I can't think of how
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:31.120]   many Caspers I've gone through, but I think I've bought almost everybody in my family a Casper
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:37.600]   mattress. I just bought my daughter at the frame, the foundation, the mattress, the sheets, the pillows,
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:44.160]   everything. And it was a really good deal. I love our Casper mattresses. Casper mattresses are made
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:49.920]   with 86 supportive gel pots to align your spine and eliminate aches and pains. It's- it's-
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:59.120]   curiously supportive and yet soft. So, you wake refreshed and ready to go. The wave hybrid I'm
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:02.560]   opening here. Actually, I think this is the wave hybrid. It's perfect for people who have aches and
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:08.240]   pains and want a mattress with maximum support and cooling. And yet, do you see how comfy that looks?
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:12.880]   For the most plush mattress, check out the Nova Hybrid with a plush feel that doesn't sacrifice
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:17.920]   support. Or what I got, my daughter, the original mattress for sleepers who want both support and
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:23.040]   cooling. And you know what? She loves it. I love my original Casper pillow. It's made with a unique
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.400]   pillow and pillow design. Soft on the outside, supportive on the inside. I got the king size
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:33.680]   and it is- I just wrap myself around it every night. And you know that feeling when you go to bed
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.680]   and you've got great sheets and great pillows and a great mattress and you just-
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:46.800]   Ah, I get that every night. I just love that. Casper makes everything you need to refresh
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.360]   your whole bedroom this year. We're spending a lot of time at home. You deserve a nice bedroom,
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:57.440]   super soft percale sheets, all season down duvets. They even have- and I haven't tried this- a cozy
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:03.600]   calming, weighted blanket. I hear good things. I might try this. And of course, the Glow Lamp,
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:10.000]   which I love, as always, Casper offers free shipping and free returns with no contact delivery.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:15.840]   These are the best mattresses you can get. And I love them. Make 2021 comfortable.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:22.640]   Reset your rest. Go to Casper.com/Twit1. If you use the code "Twit1", you'll get $100 off select
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:27.200]   mattresses. Some terms and conditions apply. You can see Casper.com for more details.
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:38.080]   That's Casper. C-A-S-P-E-R.com/Twit1 and the offer code "Twit1" for $100 off select mattresses.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:47.520]   I have to add it up. I think I've bought six or seven Casper mattresses. Everybody in my family,
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.360]   my sister-in-law, my son, my daughter, everybody sleeps on Casper's.
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:08:03.200]   We did mention who wrote Bernie. He's been in Bernie everywhere. There was a site that was
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:09.360]   put in Bernie anywhere. It merged this picture of Bernie Sanders at the inauguration and his big
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:16.400]   old mittens with your Google Maps location. You could enter any address. Apparently, it was very
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:22.320]   popular. And the guy has now shut it down. Probably cost a lot. He says, "Due to API costs,
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:26.560]   I can't keep the site going." He created 9.8 million Bernie memes.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:33.280]   9. There he is. Hi, Bernie. How you doing?
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:42.960]   Bernie Sanders is now selling t-shirts for charity with the Bernie meme on the t-shirt,
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:53.440]   which I think is great. Let's see. Oh, sad. We'll do a couple of obituaries.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:09:00.640]   You remember the ultimate collection of WindSock software, Two Cows? Do you guys in France or
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:12.160]   UK? Yeah. It was a BBS originally. Found it in 1993 on a library computer in Flint, Michigan,
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:20.880]   eventually became probably the number one download site in the world. But it is now, I'm sad to
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:29.200]   say, being turned off Elliot Noss, who is the CEO and good friend. They're giving the archive to
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:35.440]   the Internet archives as it should be, because we don't want to forget this. They've gone on
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.120]   other things. As you know, they do Hover.com, our sponsor. They have a Ting Internet, another
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:50.160]   sponsor that does phones. So they're doing other things. But I don't know. I'm old enough to
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:57.680]   remember downloading a lot of stuff from Two Cows. I remember Two Cows. I mean, those sites back in
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:04.480]   the day, I think my fondness for them just stems from the fact that when we were on dial-up modems,
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.440]   you'd spend a lot of time staring at that logo. Oh, yeah. And if you were in a stereo logo,
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.600]   why wouldn't you want to stare at a bunch of cows? I mean, exactly. It's just nice.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:21.360]   So yeah, two cows download.com. And I know that's still around and source forage. But
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:26.800]   although those kind of repositories, yeah, I've got a big fondness for those dating back to the 90s.
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.240]   LG is considering getting out of smartphones. I think it must be the wing that really
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:40.160]   put them down. That was the weird swiveling phone. They actually make some pretty nice phones,
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:47.760]   but Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi just dominate. And they just can't compete. So apparently,
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:54.800]   LG's CEO is notified employees that they're considering winding down the smartphone business.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:00.640]   Actually, here's a good story. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has launched a new Raspberry Pi
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:08.240]   for box. It's one of their custom chips. It's a microcontroller, really isn't a full Raspberry Pi.
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:14.560]   But because it doesn't run an operating system, you write code directly to run on the chip.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:19.600]   But for $4, I bet there's a lot of cool things people are going to do with that.
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:27.520]   So Raspberry Pi continuing to hit things out of the park. Nate, did you have an Acorn or a BBC
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:37.360]   Micro? Of course I had an Acorn Archimedes A3000. It was one of the best things that I've ever owned.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:47.280]   The history of Acorn is well worth dipping into as well, because you've got bits of Acorn that
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:54.160]   went off into... It's just amazing. The legacy of Acorn.
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:12:01.280]   Yes. That's a simpler answer. Yes, I had an Acorn. I loved it. Can you tell? I loved my Acorn.
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:07.840]   Everybody, every Brit had a BBC Micro or an Acorn. These were inexpensive kind of starter
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:15.360]   computers. You saw Jason Howell in our promo hugging his C64 clone. When that was your first
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:21.040]   computer, you were a kid, and you imprint with that, it's like baby ducks. You never forget your first.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:25.280]   Yeah, it was amazing. The first one I had didn't even have a hard drive.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:34.320]   So the only way you could create backups of floppy disks was by filling the pitiful amount of RAM
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:39.280]   that it had with a bit of data. Swapping, swapping, swapping.
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:57.520]   I had an Amstrad CPC 664. It wasn't quite the 628, whatever, but it did have a disk drive,
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.640]   not a cassette drive, which was the lower metal. So I was very proud of that one.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.240]   Gentlemen, you want to feel old? Let me ask Louise, what was your first?
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.080]   Trying to think. I think my first smartphone was...
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:21.040]   No, no, see, there's the problem right there. We're talking about computers.
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.520]   Well, I feel like I had a smartphone before I had a smartphone.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:26.320]   See, I feel old. It worked.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:31.120]   I feel like I wasn't because I was old enough to get a smartphone, but I was still using...
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:35.200]   Well, to be fair, my mom had AWL for a long time, and I would just use like dial-ups to do my
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:41.680]   homework. Now I feel good. And she had a Dell dial-up or something, and I remember...
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:47.760]   I would aim chat with my friends on there, but I feel like my first computing experience was
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.920]   really getting a smartphone. Your first computer, but see, that's what's happening.
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:57.280]   That's going to be true of my kids, everybody. Your first computer was a smartphone.
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:04.080]   I did, but I will say, I think I was like that weird cutoff generation where I'm the oldest
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:10.320]   millennial possible, but I'm not Gen Z. I'm the youngest millennial possible, but I'm not Gen Z.
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:17.040]   All my homework was on paper. You know what I mean? It didn't tell college, basically.
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:23.520]   I feel like the kids now, they have no... Are they still teaching handwriting?
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:27.760]   I still had to learn how to do stuff in cursive, and it was still...
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.600]   I went home and the school day ended. I wasn't texting my friends all night until at least middle
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.800]   school, I feel like. And now it's totally different. I really wonder if they teach handwriting, if they
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:45.520]   do, stop. I'll tell you now, my mum is a teacher, and they definitely still teach handwriting.
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:49.680]   Really? I'm very comforting, honestly. I'm happy to hear that. Because I think it's...
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.720]   If I was a professor or a teacher, I wouldn't like computers in my classroom, honestly.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:58.160]   Oh yeah, you need to get ready to take notes. No, that's a good point.
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:01.200]   You don't want people to talk to me. There's also no way that they're paying attention.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.520]   Like, even if they are using a computer to take notes or whatever, do the...
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.600]   And there's no way. I think it's much better to have them have a notebook.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.760]   Because they're actually going to pay attention. They're going to be present.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:16.320]   Anytime I had a computer in class in college, I was totally texting my friends.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:21.680]   I was the same, "Hey, do you know what? Actually, it just reminded me of something I read earlier.
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:27.760]   Apparently, guess what's having a comeback? I see Q." What? Really? Apparently,
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:31.680]   I see Q is having a renaissance at the moment. Who knew?
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:37.440]   Everybody fled what's happened. Signal actually was down for a while.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:42.080]   Is this part of that? Like, people are saying, "What about I see Q?"
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:48.000]   Honestly, I don't know what prompted it. I just remembered reading it this afternoon.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.800]   It's having something of a renaissance. Because it's like people who were...
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:58.320]   They used it when they were younger, but they're older now. And there's this nostalgia fact going
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:06.640]   back, things being simple. And it's apparently... Yeah. It actually looks like Telegram or any other
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.320]   model. It's updated and might look really good now. It does. It does video calls with up to 30 people.
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:18.000]   You've got stickers, you've got emojis, you can record audio and video and send it.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:26.560]   That's really a full service messenger now. How interesting. Smart replies? Who runs the network?
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:33.680]   What smart replies? Does it reply for you? No, but you know how Google does that when you get a message.
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:41.200]   So it kind of replies for you. Yeah, you reply with one tab. I like that feature.
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:49.680]   I'm going to use I see Q. This looks good. If I'm not misremembering, when I was at Wired,
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:59.280]   we had an intern who, for a little while, Russian chap, really nice guy. And he told me that I see Q
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:05.520]   has remained incredibly popular in Russia. That explains... It never went away. That explains this
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:13.520]   on the website where the showcase of popular channels and groups is in Russian. All about Moscow?
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.800]   Oh, well, it must be seeing a lot of activity now. Wow.
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:26.400]   Nate, did you work at Wired UK? I worked at Wired UK for about six years until
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:32.000]   when did I leave? I think I left CNET in 2009 and I joined Bloomberg in 2015. So,
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.600]   between five and six years. Were you at the same time?
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:41.600]   Alumni of Wired in the US. No, they didn't really talk to each other that much, which is kind of sad.
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:48.000]   No, we didn't. We weren't cool enough, unfortunately. But I did come over to the San Francisco office
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.840]   a fair bit. I had some beer out of your beer robot. It was always in the office.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:56.160]   I thought beer. It's a nice album. Yeah, I made it over there.
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:03.040]   Well, folks, did you hear of Beeper? Oh, I didn't even mention Beeper.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:08.320]   And this kind of puzzles me because it doesn't seem like this solves a problem that hasn't been
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:18.000]   solved. But it's from the guy who started Pebble, right? Yeah. I message on Android using a weird
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.040]   hack. Now, I'm already using something called AirMessage. You have to keep a Mac running all the time
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.240]   running the AirMessage server. It takes the Apple messages, puts them on the server, and then I can
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:36.720]   use AirMessages on my Android to check my Apple messages. So, it affects, it's a hack, but it puts
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:42.000]   Apple messages on Android. They're going to do that. But then they said, for people who don't have
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.160]   or don't want to keep their Mac running all the time, they're going to send them
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:57.280]   old iPhone 4S. Jailbroken. Jailbroken iPhone. I mean, the goal initially is to have a unified
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:05.600]   private message app. So, the goal isn't just to have your items. It's like Pigeon or Adium or what?
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:12.240]   Except they also do a message through that ridiculous hack. I don't think anyone is going.
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:16.720]   It's going to want to keep the, but maybe, I don't know, maybe, maybe. I keep my
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:23.440]   Mac running as a server for AirMessages day and night. I just do like how many message platforms
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.720]   do most people have? And I also think some people like to turn some of them off. Some people want to
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:33.520]   pause their work notifications on the weekend, and they wouldn't want to pause their iMessages.
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:39.840]   I just wonder how much this is for a really connected person, or someone who has so much
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:44.960]   inbound stuff coming to them. I almost think it might be good for a real estate agent or someone
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:49.440]   who's dealing with a lot of inbound communications from all over the place, maybe a content creator
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:53.360]   or something like that. But I just don't know if this is going to appeal to most people. I think
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:58.800]   if you have five or six different social media accounts, you have an email address, you're posting
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:02.800]   stuff on TikTok, on Instagram, it's definitely really helpful to look at that all in one place.
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:11.520]   It's cool, though. It's kind of like the consumer version of something like Twilio or Messagebird,
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:20.240]   right? Yeah, there's unified inbox that you can WhatsApp to it, you can WeChat to it, or you can
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:25.120]   email it and vice versa. It doesn't matter. I don't like them in principle because I think
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:29.600]   you're adding another link that security can be compromised because of the...
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:36.240]   But the pure convenience, if you don't care about security or privacy, then go nuts, I suppose.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:43.120]   I feel like the real problem here is a proliferation of messaging platforms.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:48.560]   I agree. Because everybody uses a different one. I understand Beepers trying to solve that,
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:55.120]   but it's not going to solve it. Can we all just decide on one? I don't care what it is,
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:59.680]   signal would be fine, telegram would be fine, ICQ would be fine. Can we just...
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:08.080]   Please stop the insanity. By the way, Pigeon's still around, Lib Purple still works and you still
[02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:11.840]   can do it with a lot of different things. I don't know. I just want...
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:13.680]   Wow, Pigeon. I used to love Pigeon.
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:17.360]   What was he saying? He was like, "T, you had trillion?"
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:21.360]   Trillion, yeah. That was the Windows Pigeon.
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:25.840]   Was that the way around? That was around the time that I transitioned from
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:28.560]   primarily being PC to primarily being Mac.
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:34.560]   Adeam was the Mac Pigeon. Adeam. That's the worst one I think of, actually.
[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:41.840]   Finally, remember the... I don't know, maybe you don't. The big TikTok
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:53.360]   fad of last week. Sea shaddies. Remember them? These guys singing the old sea songs?
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:22:00.320]   Here's... This is the Wellerman song. Well, this guy who was a mailman and became huge
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:04.480]   isn't the greatest job and got a record contract.
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:09.120]   Why can't any of these people use a proper microphone with crying out loud?
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:15.840]   Wait a minute. I got to play this. This is from The Today Show. I got to get my audio switched over
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:32.560]   so you can hear this. It's a TikTok world. We just live in it. Everybody's doing the sea shaddie deal.
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:35.840]   Ladies and gentlemen... I just want to... I just want to... I just want to... The Gregorian throat
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:43.840]   chanting... The whole tooth. What is it? The Toovin throat singing? That'll be a record.
[02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:48.480]   Great. I've heard that done live in a cave in the peak district in Derbyshire and trust me,
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:55.360]   that is an experience. You don't want to put too long inside. It can rattle your bones.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:23:02.880]   Drugs without the drugs. That's Nate Langson. He is the consumer tech reporter for Bloomberg
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:09.840]   in the UK. He's also the host of the UK Tech Show at UKTechShow.com. I'm going to send you to bed.
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:16.560]   Anything you want to plug? No, you've plugged my favorite thing, my podcast UK Tech Show. We do it
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:23.600]   every week. It's a lot of fun. It's Tom Merritt and I, good friends. The good thing about the show is
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:28.080]   that you can listen to both without any overlap. Tom covers all the stuff you really need to know
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:35.040]   and I tend to cover all this stuff that's just really fun to know. Hopefully, you can check it out.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:41.120]   Nice. Nice. Thanks for having me. Does everybody do a podcast with Tom Merritt? I think it's the case.
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:46.240]   Oh, I don't do it with Tom. Tom is on it every week. He does a promo on my show. I do a promo on
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:53.200]   his show every week. You share. It's a podcast sharing relationship. I often do it with my brother.
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:58.960]   He's an editor at CNET. We did this week. Did he also have an acorn?
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.040]   Well, we lived together. We had the same acorn.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:08.720]   Shared it. Well, our parents would try and have a share it, but I was a pretty conniving little
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:13.840]   older brother. I'd steal his stuff and then sell them back to him, things like that.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:18.880]   Mighty Oaks from Little Acorns. Thank you for being here.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:27.360]   Thank you, Louise Mizzakis. I love your new publication. I'm very excited about this rest of
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:33.600]   the world. Three words, but the website is restofworld.org. Is that free?
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:38.880]   Yes, it's completely free. There are no ads. We don't track you. Also, the website is really
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:43.600]   light. We built it that way on purpose because we want to serve the audiences and the places
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:50.400]   that we cover too. It's a really nice reader experience. Super light, no tracking, we're a
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:55.840]   nonprofit. If you want to learn about the tech world that you won't hear anywhere else, please.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:59.440]   I think this is so great. The Chinese grocery delivery industry.
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:04.240]   Have tips about crazy trends happening. Please let me know.
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:09.520]   Do you have funding? How is it supported?
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:17.760]   We do have funding. It's a nonprofit. We are supported fully by our founder. Her name is
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:22.240]   Sophie Schmidt. She's great. She's a former tech executive. She knows a lot about the industry.
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:26.880]   She's worked abroad all over the place. We're a nonprofit. We don't take money from anyone else.
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:32.960]   No ads or anything like that. She's given back. That is awesome. That is awesome.
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:38.800]   I'm just thrilled to learn about it. Restofworld.org. I'm so glad to have you on, Louise.
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:42.720]   What's your podcast? Do you do a show with Tom Merritt? Surely.
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:47.200]   This is it. This is your podcast. I'll get Tom Merritt on next time.
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:48.880]   Then you too can have a show with Tom Merritt.
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:56.480]   And of course, not Patrick. Patrick Bejia always welcome on this show. He does so many shows.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:04.560]   They're all at notpatric.com. He's not Patrick on the Twitter. Great to see you. Congratulations
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.640]   on that show. Work in Sanity. Yes. Also with Tom Merritt.
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:17.040]   So work is very good. Tom, the air's got to be really red right now. You think it'll be hot?
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:23.520]   Only good things. Only good things. And also, if you speak French or want to speak French,
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:30.560]   you could check out Le Ronde Wutetc because you get the English version with this weekend tech.
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:34.240]   And then you already know how the things we're going to be talking about. So if you want to
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.320]   learn French or practice French, you listen to French version and you have my
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:43.120]   sultry voice and we talk about stuff you already know. So it's here to understand.
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:44.720]   And France, beep-er is beep-ay.
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:54.560]   Eggs. Wow. That was impressive. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, Louise. Thank you, Nate.
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:58.800]   Really great having you. It's always nice when we have such a smart panel. Lots to talk about.
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:05.280]   I hope you enjoyed our show today. We do this week in tech Sunday afternoons, 230 Pacific 530
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:12.560]   Eastern Time, 2230 UTC. And the reason I give you the time we record is you can watch us live.
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:18.080]   We have a live stream at all hours of the day or night at twit.tv/live. It's live audio or video.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:26.320]   Watch whatever you want. If you're watching live, the chat room also goes 24/7 at irc.twit.tv.
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:33.120]   Lovely people in there. So I encourage you to check that out. irc.twit.tv. If you want to
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:36.880]   download the shows and listen to your leisure, of course you can do that. All of our shows are
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:43.920]   available at twit.tv. We also have a full boar YouTube channel for every single show,
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:49.200]   including this week in tech. You can subscribe there. My favorite thing would be if you would
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:54.880]   get a podcast client, it doesn't matter which, and subscribe in that because that way you get
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:58.720]   it automatically. You don't have to think about it. And if you're ever in the mood for another
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:03.600]   twit, you can just fire up your podcast client and there it'll be waiting for you.
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:08.080]   It's that time again. Our annual survey is going strong. We don't want to miss your feedback. So
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:16.400]   please help us out. Go to twit.tv/survey21 to take the survey closes next month. But it helps
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:22.160]   us understand our audience, helps us make your podcasts better suited to you. It also helps us
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:27.920]   sell advertising. We don't spy on you. We don't track you. Once a year we ask you a few questions.
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:34.000]   Completely optional and only take a few minutes, but it sure would help if you go to twit.tv/survey21
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.240]   and thanks in advance. We have a couple of ways you can interact with us. We have a wonderful
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:45.760]   forums at www.twit.community. Those are discourse forums and they're really good. And many of our
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:50.960]   hosts hang out there. It's a great way to comment on any show. Every show has an entry there so you
[02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:58.960]   can comment there. We also, as I mentioned, have a mastodon instance at twit.social. And you're
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:03.440]   welcome to join us there if you're not already on mastodon. The way mastodon works, it's a
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:09.120]   federated -- it's like a federated Twitter. So you join an instance and there are hundreds and
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:16.720]   hundreds of them. In fact, if you go to join mastodon.org, I think you can pick an instance that you like.
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:22.320]   But one of them is twit.social. You could follow the folks locally on that instance or follow
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:28.320]   anybody on any other instance because it's federated. And so I think it's a nice antidote
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:34.000]   to Twitter. Not quite so busy, but a lot of fun. You're welcome to join us there. No charge, of
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:39.120]   course, for that. That's it for this edition of This Week in Tech. Thank you everybody. Have a
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:42.320]   great week. We'll see you next week and another Twits.
