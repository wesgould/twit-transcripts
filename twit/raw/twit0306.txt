[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   And actually, we're a little late.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.160]   Because we should have had this guy on last week,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.640]   Jeff Kanata from the Totally Rad Show.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   Hey, glad to be back.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.480]   This is awesome.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.400]   Yeah, last week, of course, was E3.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.760]   But I wanted to give you time to play Duke Nukem Forever.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.440]   You would want to punish me like that.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.320]   I wanted to give you enough time to give us a review.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.640]   We'll talk about that a little bit.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.320]   But I also want to introduce panelists number two,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.680]   Miss Molly Wood.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.800]   So nice to have you.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   It's good to be back.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   I missed you.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.440]   We haven't had you on in a year, I think.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.720]   Something like that, yeah.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.520]   That was crazy time.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.840]   That was the court mandated cooling off period.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.400]   We worked it out.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.480]   We had our drinks.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.000]   Good now.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.240]   So nice to see you, Molly.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   Of course, on CNET TV, at CNETTV.com,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   hosts a buzz out loud.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.600]   Many other fine things at CBA.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.320]   Big shakeup at CBS Interactive.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.120]   I'm going to ask you about that.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.160]   Mr. Farber's back.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.040]   Farber's back.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.560]   I like it.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.240]   On my boss, though.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.520]   I don't have that much to say about it.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.120]   I like Dan.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.080]   I'm a big fan.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.560]   But I'll ask you about that.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.240]   What you think it means?
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.200]   There's a new boss.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.560]   There's a new boss in town from click.tv, I think.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.920]   Clicker.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.400]   Clicker.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.840]   We also hear Mr. Paris Lemon himself.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.600]   Hey.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.520]   MG Seagler, not, as some in the chat room would have at MG Lane.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.800]   I can go by that.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.240]   You want to?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.880]   I'll change it.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.040]   Nice to have you, MG.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.840]   MG, of course, is probably the most prolific blogger there is at techcrunched.com.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:26.600]   I wrote a great blog post today, likening Facebook to the victims of Sparta.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   Yeah, that's been fun dealing with ramifications of that.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.320]   His headline, "Tonight We Dine In Hell."
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   So if I may paraphrase, your contention was that Facebook--
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   well, first of all, you hate PR people in general.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.480]   I wouldn't say that generally sweeping of a statement.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.720]   I mean, I like some of them individually just fine.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.560]   But I would say as a whole that their goal is the opposite of mine, so yes, we're a war.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.280]   Yeah, you would think, in fact, that PR people would recognize that their job is to help you
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.080]   do your job.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.000]   Right.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.840]   I feel like, though, we've gotten away from that entirely pretty much.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.640]   They become advocates for their company.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   But it's not even so much that.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.840]   It's like the ways that they're trying to do it.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.000]   Obviously, they're going to be doing that.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.480]   That's what they're hired to do.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.600]   That's what they're paid to do.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.120]   But some of the manipulation stuff is not cool that they've been partaking in.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.000]   And Facebook is the perfect example of that, I think, recently.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   So tell me what, of course, we know the first in Marsteller story where Facebook hired a
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.840]   PR friend to slime Google.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   Right.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.920]   That was a really bad situation.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.160]   This latest thing is not to that level.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   It's just more or less-- I had a few big Facebook scoops earlier last week, two of them, with
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.280]   a third kind of being a third story on it.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.720]   As soon as one of those hit, Facebook kind of just went into action and got their PR team
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.800]   to start reaching out to other sites, other bloggers kind of and saying, hey, maybe you
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.480]   should write this angle, which is directly opposed to what TechCrunch had said about it.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.120]   And the problem is, of course, that I'm a little bit closer to some of these other people
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.320]   that Facebook is reaching out to than they may have thought for some reason.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.760]   So I get these emails sent to me, forwarded to me, showing exactly what they're trying
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.280]   to spin this as.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.600]   I love that when it all happens.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.680]   When a competitor tries to slime you, thinking that another blogger might be your natural
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.000]   enemy and they go, yeah, right.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.280]   I am a little more friends with MG than you, you little slimeball, weasel, bag of scum.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   Right.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   That's more or less what I try to say.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   I don't feel fettled yet.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.920]   Well, actually though, this ties into a Duke Nukem forever because the PR firm for Duke
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.800]   Nukem Forever, Jeff Kanata, well, at least one of the head of the PR firm wasn't too
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   happy about the bad reviews I gather.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.000]   And unfortunately, he made it public and said.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.160]   He tweeted.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   He tweeted.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.680]   Which as we've come to learn in any context is the wrong way to handle anything.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.560]   Well, I think he shouldn't have sent the crotch shot to the guy who could talk.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.960]   I think that was a mistake.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.440]   A little over the top.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.800]   So yeah, he said that some of the reviews in his opinion were over the line and had gone
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.560]   over into being insulting and sort of reveling in trashing the game and was going to make
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.960]   it clear that in future cases they were going to take a different stance on who was going
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.240]   to get early review copies of games based on how people reviewed this game, which of course
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.160]   is ridiculous and 2K to their credit distance themselves from him.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:50.080]   And unfortunately, this is a public expression of this idea of limiting access.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   It's always been that way.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.360]   They do it all the time.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   Exactly.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.240]   So one guy actually comes out and says it and he gets busted, but it's been the case
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.000]   for a long time.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.960]   And unfortunately, in a lot of industries and the gaming industry is one that PR controls
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.240]   access completely.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.520]   So it's a difficult thing when you want access to these games early and you want hits on
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.440]   your site and you want that review to come up when the day the game drops and you need
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.920]   access to that game and yet they're asking you to play nice.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.640]   It's a tough position to be in.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.520]   So the PR company is the Redner group and the tweeter is, oh, that's interesting.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.720]   He pulled the tweet down.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.480]   Oh, I was going to show you the tweet.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   Yeah, wonder why.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   Maybe he says too many went too far with their reviews of Duke Nukem.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.640]   We are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's venom.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.760]   Wow.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.280]   But it does happen, doesn't it?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.560]   You, I mean, we've all seen this.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.240]   We're a PR from whether Sinley Vayldor not says, well, you know, don't count on the
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.880]   an iPod next time, buddy boy.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   Right, Molly?
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   Absolutely.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.280]   And in fact, Apple's probably the worst defender in terms of playing that game.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.320]   I didn't mean to well, the worst defender on the tech side, the video game industry,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.280]   I think it's been, it's long been an open secret that the video game industry works
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.200]   on that system more than most.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.440]   And the thing that's really a shame about the video game industry is how much review
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.040]   scores are tied into compensation on the production side.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:38.280]   I mean, you have guys whose contracts have bonuses based on Metacritic scores, which
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.920]   is absolutely ridiculous to me.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.040]   I mean, I understand the motivation to try to make better games, but when you have that
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.920]   much emphasis put on a number that's assigned by anybody on the web, really, you're going
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.440]   to get these conflict of interests.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   And that seems like a bad idea.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.720]   I don't, yeah, that's, that's too bad.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   It happens all the time.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.400]   I, you know, I just, I stay away from PR people.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   I know, like you, MG, I know a lot of nice PR people, like most of them are very nice
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   people.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   Right.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.960]   But I mean, they're like in an individual basis, of course, they're not evil people,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.920]   you know, setting out to do to screw over other people.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.480]   I just think that, you know, that this is like the directive coming down from their bosses.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.320]   And that's what they, they want them to do.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   So they're doing it.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.840]   But I've always felt like it should be an adversarial situation.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.760]   But I never, I see your, I think you're in a different position, but because I don't
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.400]   know, I don't actually deal with facts.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.120]   So that's helpful.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.720]   So it's easy for me.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.160]   I don't really, I don't need anything from them.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   You know, it's really, it's the only way to go.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   Like, you know what?
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.520]   No, I'm not interested in your product unless I can find something really kind of snotty
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.920]   to say about it on my show.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.440]   Well, I don't say that either.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.080]   But I, but I just, you know, to me, I just want to use, I don't want to deal with them.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   I'll buy the product.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   I just want to use the product.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   And I'll tell you what I think of it.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   Period.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   That's end of that.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.280]   And, and see you did, for instance, MG, you opened the can of worms because when you wrote
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.000]   about this new Facebook, was it the Sparta project?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   Yeah, project Spartan.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   Project Spartan.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.080]   You see, you went to Facebook PR and offered them a chance to comment.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   Right.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.080]   Right.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.080]   Of course.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.520]   Well, you know, sometimes we do that.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   Sometimes we don't.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   I don't know.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.520]   But this seems like a natural thing.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.640]   I mean, you know, I knew a lot about it.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   I had some access to it.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.440]   And so I wanted to see if they wanted to say something about it and they had nothing
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   to say.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.880]   So I published what I was going to publish in the first place and then they get all mad,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.520]   you know, that I publish that.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   So well, I'm mad.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.840]   What are they going to do?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.160]   Actually, what they could do is they could embed something in the Facebook code that makes
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   it impossible for tech crunch writers to see what's going on.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.720]   So they already do that actually.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.400]   I mean, they literally have that feature and they've joked about it.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.680]   We posted a few weeks ago, we posted a video, a tech talk that they did at their headquarters.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.840]   Basically they have anyone but tech crunch can see this little switch that they can flip.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.560]   The problem is this was totally outside of that.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.360]   This wasn't live code that I saw.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.520]   This is, you know, behind a few different levels.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.120]   Does sound like there might be a little shooting war though between Facebook and tech crunch,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   just a little.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.560]   And I don't know if you remember the story probably from like two years ago, I guess
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.800]   now, they actually put a feature in the site.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.320]   Yeah, Facebook facts.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.400]   And we wrote about it and it's like, what is this feature?
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.080]   Like who on earth is going to fax anything?
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.240]   It turns out this was just a feature that they turned on for the tech crunch network
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.080]   of employees right there.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   So we could all see it.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.400]   No one else could see it.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.800]   And then yeah, they had their fun with that one.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   So we owed them.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   We got them.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   The truth is I think this has always gone on when president, you know, actually campaign,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:00.520]   a campaigner, Richard Nixon hired admin to run his campaign and the Democrats hired
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.680]   a guy named Dick Tuck to be a dirty trickster in the 1968 campaign.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.880]   He did things like remember Nixon's campaign slug and was Nixon's the one.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.200]   And Dick Tuck mentions this.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.400]   He was a PR and ad guy.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.920]   He mentions this in his memoir.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.320]   He got a bunch of pregnant women to meet Richard Nixon as he was whistle stopping with the sign.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.520]   Nixon's the one over their pregnant bellies and, you know, that got a good laugh.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.880]   This has gone on for a long time.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.280]   This is this is the dirty trick side of PR.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   Of course, of course.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   So I, what are we going to do?
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   What are we going to complain about?
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.280]   Do you have Jeff?
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.280]   Have you ever been bit by this?
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.160]   You know, not too much.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.640]   I'm like you.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.200]   I'm not really a journalist.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   We're pundits.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   I consider my pundits.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   Absolutely.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.680]   And I come on and say my opinion and it's my opinion and no one controls it and they
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.640]   can take it or leave it as far as I'm concerned.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.080]   But you know, it is nice when you get access, you get that early scoop on stuff.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.520]   I'm just not willing to compromise anything.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.560]   And I don't, you know, obviously nobody's going to cop to that.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   But I don't even do embargoes.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.840]   Do you do embargoes, Molly or NDAs?
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.920]   I guess you have to.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   I don't usually personally.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.920]   I think we may be agreed to one or two over the course of Buzz out loud.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   Obviously news.com does.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.560]   I mean, I can see why the PR people of the world and the PR agencies of the world are
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.760]   getting increasingly desperate because they cannot figure out a way to handle the leaks.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   Right?
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.920]   I mean, the entire landscape has changed.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.000]   They used to have at least a modicum of control over a point.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.480]   It would be kind of surprising when there was a big like supply chain leak.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:43.200]   But now you just, you know, even Apple cannot legitimately keep something secret forever.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.120]   And I think they just, it's kind of like dealing with a two year old, like you just
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.400]   don't know how to handle it.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.760]   So you get matter and matter and matter and scream at them and scream at them.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.280]   And obviously that's never going to work.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.760]   They have to really respond to the fact that their jobs are not the same as they used to
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   be.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   That's a really good point.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.520]   Partly that's because, well, it's all because of the internet, but it's because there's
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.560]   so many bloggers, there's so many people digging and all it takes is one, you know, leak and
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.680]   boom, it's all out there.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.800]   But this is good for, frankly, it's good for the end users because we have more information
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.880]   and we can't be spun as easily.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.720]   I mean, they really, they're just going to have to wake up to the fact that we're going
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.000]   to get this information.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   We're going to publish it because why wouldn't we?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.560]   And that ultimately is good for consumers because the system of sort of control and,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.280]   you know, controlled release was always about media manipulation at its core anyway.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.360]   Like I'm sorry PR world that we're not as easily manipulated as we used to be other than
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.880]   bi-apple, but it's a new world.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.400]   I considered a badge of honor that I no longer get invited to Apple events.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.360]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360]   And we're able to cover it.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.440]   It doesn't affect our coverage really.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.280]   I just thought was interesting.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.440]   The kind of open bickering now between journalists and PR and your fight in a good fight.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   I like it.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.080]   It'll get much worse too.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.240]   This is just this is step one of something that's going to continue to snowball into,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.400]   you know, into every publication.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.880]   What's the repercussions then of your article today?
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.520]   Have you?
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520]   From them?
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.520]   I haven't heard a peep from them.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.120]   I've heard a peep from every single other company.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   I think for everything from Bravo to wow, you were really kind of harsh, those guys,
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.000]   I haven't heard a peep from them and I don't expect to.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.840]   I mean, if they know how to get in touch with me if they want to, but I don't know.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   We'll see.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:35.120]   In some ways, it's also the disadvantage of writing for such a high profile publication
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:42.480]   or being on such a high profile show or, you know, I kind of like being in the backwater.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   I don't want the attention.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.800]   I don't want them to know what I'm saying.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.040]   And every once in a while, I get like, I'll get a...
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.520]   Hey, you're really in the backwater.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   No, I am.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.520]   No, no, no.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.040]   Nobody knows we exist and I think that's good.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   I want to keep it up.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.960]   Seriously, I'm not kidding.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.520]   Every once in a while, I'll get an email from somebody saying, "Hey, I heard what you
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.520]   said."
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.520]   And I'm always shocked.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.800]   And I think that it mostly comes from, because we have this tight knit group of listeners
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.000]   and viewers and they're kind of...
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It's insular.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.080]   They're kind of insulated.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.360]   And then, but they tweet about it or it's, you know, some of them are tattle tails and
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.520]   they will go tell somebody.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.640]   And that's when I know, you know.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.120]   Here's a casting a major, making a major stroke for authenticity.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.480]   Apparently, President Obama is going to actually tweet.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.080]   Really?
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.920]   Do we think that's actually going to be him?
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.400]   Oh, come on.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.280]   His first tweet was today, right?
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   His father's day tweet.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   Father's day.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.720]   Could they sign it?
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.320]   Be oh, if it weren't him.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.160]   Oh, that's check and make your absolute right.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160]   Would they reconsider signing it?
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.800]   Be oh, no matter what.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.120]   Mr. Hussein.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.240]   I just can't wait until Barack starts having hashtags on stuff, you know, like getting in
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.000]   with all the memes.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.320]   So Barack is weighing in on all the pressing issues on Twitter.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.000]   How do you know if the first lady is makin' on you?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.080]   So he said, so I'm lookin' now on his Twitter account.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   There it is.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.360]   It's got the big B.O. on it.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.600]   I'm a father, sometimes my hardest, but always my most rewarding job.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Happy father.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   I don't know.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   What does that mean when he tweeted it?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.840]   Did he like dictate it to a secretary who then went down the hall to the official social
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.560]   media consultant for the--
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   I think that's right.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.800]   I mean, seriously, what does that mean?
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   Is he's not typing it into his blackberry?
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   I'll tell you.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.760]   I looked at the-- if you look on the source of it, it says it's from the web, so it wasn't
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   sent from a blackberry or any kind of mobile device.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.640]   I assume that these still have to be, if not copy edited, cleared for any kind of weird
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   statement that could be in there that could be misconstrued as something.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.520]   So yeah, he probably dictates it to someone, and then it's his words, and then someone
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   tweets it for him, of course.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.360]   I just have-- it's like a West Wing episode.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.360]   I know what happens.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   He dictates it.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.280]   They bring it down the hall to the social media expert who brings it down to the basement
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.640]   to the White House Council.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.040]   The White House Council then vets it, and then they bring it upstairs to somebody in the
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.280]   Navy who has a special typing machine.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.880]   And he's like a naval officer, and then he types it into the special typing machine,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.520]   and then it goes on to Twitter.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.120]   It's like being a father is my hardest job.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   Now, we don't want to go with is.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.360]   We want to do-- sometimes is my hardest job, because that would make the constituents think
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.120]   that other things aren't hard.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   That's true.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   I bet he did say that.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   It's hard to stress.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   It's harsh to death.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.160]   I bet they said, can we put sometimes in there?
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.080]   Also, I got to say, I'm pro the authenticity argument, but I don't really want him to have
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   time for this.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.880]   No, that's a good point.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.760]   I don't need this.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.520]   I need other things.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.080]   Is this really the tweet we want to read?
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.400]   If you've enjoyed the President's tweets, don't worry.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.920]   He'll still make frequent appearances here.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.640]   It's like, no.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.720]   Come on, get to work, dude.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.120]   Get off the Twitter.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.160]   On the other hand, this is all about his campaign, right?
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.920]   They're doing this now because they're ramping it up for the 2012 election, of course, before
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.080]   the past few years, whatever.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.040]   This account has been alive with 8 million plus followers.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   It just hasn't been him.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.720]   It's been the Democratic National Committee or whatever tweeting for him.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.320]   So they say Obama for America's staff, which is the campaign staff, by the way.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   It's not the White House.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.280]   We'll be managing both President Obama's Facebook page and his Twitter account, posting
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.080]   daily updates from the campaign trail and everywhere in between.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.520]   You'll be hearing from President Obama regularly too.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.360]   Tweets will be signed dash B.O.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.200]   I just wish he had this a couple of months ago.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.000]   You know, could have had the first-hand report of Osama killing.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Right.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.200]   That's the tweet you want him to do.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.880]   Yeah, what if he broke that news over Twitter?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   I think he's got him.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   It's in the situation.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   Dash B.O.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.800]   Yeah, in the situation where you'll hear about this tomorrow, daddy B.O.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.320]   Cool stuff going down.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   OH.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   We got that son of a day.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   I think it's good.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   I like it.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   I do want to see.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.320]   I found my birth certificate hashtag suckatron.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:18.360]   Okay, if you had a little time for that, that would be okay.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   Well, that's what I'm wondering.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.080]   I mean, maybe that I don't know.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.880]   I mean, well, maybe he hears now all of us saying this kind of stuff.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.320]   And I think other people are going to be putting this out there.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   Is it actually him tweeting?
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.400]   Is he having some kind of, you know, Aaron Boy run over and tweet these things?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.560]   So I'm sure we're going to see a picture of him typing at a keyboard and like the angle
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.800]   of him actually tweeting.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   Right.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   Yeah, I'm sure we'll see that.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   You're right.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   Of course we will.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.160]   And that's really the important thing to remember.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   You made that point.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.760]   This is not the White House.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.520]   It said the picture says 2012.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.760]   This is the beginning of the re-election campaign is what this really is.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   Right.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.960]   And then I love reading the replies.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   Like people think they're talking to him.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.360]   Hey, that's good to hear.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.440]   I like hearing from my president says Kingdom victory.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   I do want to know what happened when I, when I was sorry, go ahead, MG.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.600]   I do want to know what happens if I were to DM him.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.120]   So he follows, you know, that account follows me.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.160]   If I send him a message, who reads that?
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   We're in.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.680]   What were you saying, Jeff?
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.800]   I was just saying of all the presidential candidates we've ever had, I would say he's
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   the one I'm most likely to think it could possibly be him once or twice.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   It's likely to tweet.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   It's in his yearbook.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.440]   Here's a response from Ken Yatta, 1969.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.160]   Barack Obama, don't sit around tweeting.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.920]   Get us out of Iraq.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.920]   Here's one.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.720]   I have received many tweets and emails, B.O. still waiting for dinner invitation.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.640]   Oh, here's a good one from Julie Eclan.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.560]   Barack Obama, sorry you are making this change.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   Unfollowing now.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.760]   Man, that Twitter crowd is harsh.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.800]   They're like, I liked it when there were no tweets on it.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.520]   That's exactly right.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   Stop tweeting.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.480]   I get that all the time.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.240]   I start tweeting people say, I'm unfollowing you.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.640]   That's so annoying how the president is clogging up my Twitter.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.240]   I don't want to see those.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   Jerk.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   Jerk.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   He tweets too much.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   Jerk.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.840]   I like basketball that much.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.440]   If I wanted to hear from Barack Obama, I would not have followed Barack Obama on Twitter.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.440]   That's a good point.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.360]   OK, you guys know because you're on the inside.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   Who tweets for real?
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.920]   Does Lady Gaga really do her tweets?
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.360]   I would guess she does.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   No, no.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   You think?
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   No.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   Molly, you're a woman.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.400]   She actually, I think Lady Gaga might.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   They feel very real.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.560]   They feel those feel pretty authentic.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.120]   They should do her albums.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.920]   I don't know.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.920]   She lipsticks.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.400]   But she tweets.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.440]   Paris Hilton, we know doesn't tweet because Paris was something when she was in jail or
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.880]   something and said, "I think I'm going to watch a movie tonight."
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   OK, we think that's probably her social media expert who didn't get the text message,
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.160]   "Stop tweeting, Paris is in prison."
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   I don't know.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:17.040]   I think that it is a little unseemly for the president of the United States to tweet.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.800]   On the other hand, you do want authentic, genuine communication from your leaders.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   I don't.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   I don't.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Right?
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   He's not my friend.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.120]   I want authentic, genuine communication on TV and in press releases and in regular updates
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.600]   on what's going on in as much as he can tell me.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.160]   But I don't need to feel like we're buddies like that on Twitter.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.840]   Well, does Twitter have to be used as a buddy system?
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.640]   It can be a news service, right?
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.480]   He can be using it as a way to send in information.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   That is absolutely how it's used now.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   That's what it's called.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.240]   I think that's how it has been used up to this point, but for them to make this big point
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.600]   about how sometimes he's going to tweet and he's going to talk about how being a dad is
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   hard.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.680]   That, I guess I feel like I don't need from Obama, Twitter account.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.000]   I wouldn't necessarily expect it.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.440]   I would imagine the majority of the tweets we're going to see are like, thank you Cincinnati
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.040]   for your warm reception during my campaign trail, you know, B.O.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   Thank you.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   It'll be planned.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.800]   $8 million and we'll spend it wisely.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   Right.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   Thank you.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   Right.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.960]   Here's a link to the campaign.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   Donate now.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.960]   Well, in fact, right there on the Facebook page, it's exactly what it says, "donate now."
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   I got a text message yesterday from the campaign saying, "would you like to have dinner with
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   Barack Obama?"
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.960]   I thought, "great."
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   He said, "click this link."
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   I said, "yes, sir."
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.400]   And then it said, "it's a lottery and you have to give him money and maybe you'll get
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.040]   to go."
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.520]   I thought that was illegal.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   Maybe it's not in the White House.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.800]   21 million people like his Facebook page.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.840]   That's a pretty big number.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.400]   21.7 million people.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.720]   Still 2012 really come down to how well you use the internet and social media.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   How important is that?
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.640]   It was somewhat important last time.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   Is it going to be everything this year?
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.560]   This next time.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   Molly, you follow this.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.560]   What do you think?
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.680]   I think it is going to come down to how much reading you do, right?
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.480]   How well you monitor it.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.200]   I think you probably do have to be part of it and I think that President Obama has done
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.840]   a good job of being involved in live streamed Facebook town halls.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.440]   That was pretty cool.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   I think that's cool.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   I think that's really important.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.720]   I think he visited Twitter headquarters for crying out loud.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.760]   I think that that stuff shows that he is of the community or he's aware of what's happening
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   online.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.800]   I don't know that it necessarily means he has to be tweeting.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.960]   It's probably not the worst thing ever.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:45.040]   I don't want him to open himself up to attacks on how busy he is not that he has time to
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   tweet.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.720]   You've got to be paying attention for sure.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.240]   I think you have to show that you're paying attention to these trends.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.880]   I also think that in an era where we have candidates who are actively combative with
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.560]   major news organizations to have a place that they can disseminate information on their
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.760]   own terms, in their own voice, is extremely attractive to them.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.920]   If they can manage to get an audience that is completely unfiltered, that they have direct
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.840]   one-to-one communication with on either side of the political aisle, that is something
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.600]   that they're going to want to take advantage of.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   Exactly right.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   It's a disintermediation.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.520]   It's what the internet's all about.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   It's Father's Day.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.440]   We have a Google Doodle to talk about and a lot more.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:32.200]   Jeff Kanata is here from The Totally Rad Show on Revision 3 and he is @JeffKanata on Twitter.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   What else do you want to plug?
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.920]   You got to ask somebody else to plug?
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.120]   I do the We Can Confirmed podcast, which is all about video games once a week on ShackNews.com.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   Cool.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.200]   And somebody in the chatroom wants your review of the new Woody Allen film, so maybe later.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.400]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   I'm excited.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   I'm a huge Woody Allen fan.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   Wow.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   You're going to love it.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   Molly Wood is also here from CBS Interactive and CNETTV.com.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.680]   Molly Wood on the Twitter.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   Whoop.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.840]   Every once in a while you go dark and then you come back.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.320]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.840]   It's just maintaining my aura of mystery.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   Yes.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   I like it.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:19.640]   History woman from CBS and M.G. Seagler from TechCrunch and Paris Lemon on the Twitter.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.080]   Easy to remember.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.040]   Just think of sour lemon, Eiffel Tower.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   Exactly.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.240]   Stuck on the Eiffel Tower.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   Easy.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   Perfect.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.120]   We're going to take a little tiny little itty bitty break.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.280]   You may smoke them if you've got them panel and while you do that I'll talk about go-to
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.000]   meeting.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Our good friends at Citrix have so many good products based on their very high quality
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.360]   remote access back end.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.400]   Go-to meeting is the one I use more than anything and that's because unfortunately I hate this
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.600]   but as you become a business you got to have meetings.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.320]   Gosh darn it.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.400]   Who thought that up?
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.520]   The worst kind of meeting, the worst, the one you don't want to do is the conference call
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.880]   where you all sit on the phone and you know the other guys play in Tetris or harvesting
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.800]   is cauliflower and I just hate it.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   That's why I like go-to meeting.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.000]   Go-to meeting is a great effect.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.680]   We don't even if it's just a conference call we will start it with go-to meeting because
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.400]   go-to meeting has built in a conference bridge as well as voice over IP so you can use it
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.960]   on your computer with the headphones and mic on your computer on your iPad or you can
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.360]   use the telephone and then should you need to show somebody something it's really easy
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.920]   just to fire up the you know that say look look here it is on the screen and they can
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.280]   see your screen.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.700]   Great for presentations for training for collaborating on documents and because it's brought
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:40.300]   to you by Citrix they've got great 24/7 support they've got 128 bit SSL so it's completely
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:45.920]   safe to use even in an open Wi-Fi access spot and it's just reliable fast easy to set
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.240]   up and just just great.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.360]   We in our calendars now it's so funny we don't say we're gonna have a meeting anymore
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.160]   I'll get the email saying we're gonna have a G2M.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.140]   Okay I know what you're talking about.

[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.940]   So the Google Doodle today I kind of like it's like felt it looks like it's felt.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.940]   Yeah thanks.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.140]   Yeah and a little tie on it happy Father's Day.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.260]   It's so strange what they decide to do doodles on and what they don't.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:38.740]   You know like IPV6 they didn't do anything but less Paul's 92nd anniversary of his birth
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.740]   they did something.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.540]   It's like you never know what they're gonna doodle.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.140]   This one doesn't seem to be interactive I keep trying to make it do something.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.620]   Have you ever gotten a tie for Father's Day Leo?
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.780]   Every Father's Day you bet.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.780]   Do you really?
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.780]   Yeah yeah.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.780]   How about you?
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.780]   Well you're not a father you wouldn't.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.820]   I'm not a father but I've never given a tie before so I just I feel like that's an outdated
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.980]   idea but clearly not.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.220]   Well what would you give your dad?
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.220]   I gave him a gift certificate for golf.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.220]   Perfect.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.220]   That's just as cliched.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.220]   No it's perfect.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.220]   That's good.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.220]   That's good.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.940]   Oh I think gadgets I think technology is probably pretty popular.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.380]   For sure.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.660]   If you're really wealthy and you want to really you really like your father and iPad or one
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.540]   of them new Android tablets I just was looking at the I hadn't paid much attention to it
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.940]   but there are a bunch of videos now on this new HP touchpad the WebOS pad.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.660]   I like how that looks.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.380]   If you guys looked at it all or I'm on time.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.380]   I haven't played with it.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.380]   I've seen it.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.380]   Yeah it does look really good.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.220]   I always really liked WebOS you know the pre and what not it was just that hardware was
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.740]   too slow so hopefully this is good.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.740]   It was underpass.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.340]   Yeah I feel like this tablet can definitely be a dark horse.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.740]   I mean it obviously is going to depend on some app support but WebOS is such a it really
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.380]   is just a good operating system.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.580]   It's easy to use it's pretty intuitive probably even more so than honeycomb.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.540]   I have kind of high hopes for this one.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:08.820]   Well oddly enough the Blackberry's playbook they say they've shipped 500,000.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.260]   You laugh.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.060]   Oh they've shipped 500,000.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:18.420]   How many you know they're 499,999 sitting on the store shelves.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.300]   Yeah and that's kind of that's the question mark on Android tablets.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.420]   I don't think they're very selling very well.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.300]   Samsung apparently is the best seller with its 10.1.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.300]   I like it.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.300]   That's the one that Google gave away at Google I/O.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.860]   It's nice but Android isn't an iPad.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.740]   It's just not the same.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:45.940]   Yeah the 10.1 the Galaxy tab is by far much better than the zoom but you know it's still
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.220]   not I still have no idea who would buy that at basically the same price over an iPad.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.220]   Exactly.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.340]   It was thrown back.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.380]   The zoom is just you know suffering horrible torments at this point.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.220]   In fact they've announced not only have they they doubt did they downgrade their earnings
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:15.060]   net income down to 695 million from 934 but they looks like we've got layoffs coming.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.780]   I think the playbook was kind of considered the last best hope.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:24.300]   They have a nice Blackberry 9900 but is it over for rim?
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:29.700]   I think it's got to be close to over for rim unless they get in some new leadership stat.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.580]   I mean honestly I don't understand why they put their last best hope in the playbook in
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   the first place.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.500]   I think they got distracted by a market that is a little bit overblown.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.980]   I mean I think half the reason that you know Android tablets aren't taking off and the
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.500]   iPad sales have plateaued a tiny bit is that that's a pretty discreet market right now.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.140]   Not that many people need a tablet in the first place and then they completely failed
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.900]   to articulate who on earth would need a playbook and I feel like they took their eye off the
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.180]   ball which was make some better phones.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.940]   Yeah that's a good point and they haven't and they really have fallen behind in phones.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.620]   I mean really the storm and the storm too that's your answer to the touchscreen smartphone
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.620]   market.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.620]   Guys.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.540]   You know who uses Blackberries?
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.580]   Oh high schoolers love Blackberries and I guess college kids by extension because they use
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.700]   the Blackberry messenger and that's of course why Apple's doing eye messenger to compete
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   with that.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.500]   I think this is probably the father's dig.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.900]   It is a Kindle.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.660]   Amazing legs on that thing.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.940]   This is the one with the ad supported Kindle.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.580]   So on the you know it's not too big.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.420]   I love my Kindle.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.580]   I started reading it on the iPad a little bit just because it was easier to do it in
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.380]   bed and you could leave all the lights off except for the iPad and then I went back to
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.300]   the Kindle and realized how much better I and the image better it was.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   114 dollars.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   This is Wi-Fi.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   You get the ad on the front.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   That's the difference.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   Right.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   Does the ad bother you at all?
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.140]   No no no and then there's a little bar there but when you're actually reading a book the
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.100]   ad goes away and this is nice.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.020]   You can now get audible books play on here which I really like.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.700]   Your whole audible libraries in there.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.980]   They've got a new interface for that.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   I think this is.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.060]   I don't think down to $99 with the ad on it.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.580]   That's going to be a really enticing price.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.580]   They're close.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.580]   You're right though.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   They do.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.580]   They need to get under a hundred don't they?
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.300]   But you see this is this is so I'm reading the book here.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.300]   There's no sorry about the word lubrication.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.820]   I don't I don't know how that.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:37.740]   Are you are you are you able to sink back and forth between audio and text for.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.940]   No the whisper.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.820]   It's a wonderful a wonderful.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.820]   I asked audible for that many times because then you could have an audible book on here
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.580]   you could read when you can't listen but then it would take you to that point in the audio.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.580]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.580]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.580]   I would love that.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.580]   I love audio books.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.700]   You listen them all the time but I was oftentimes one of them read where I left off as you're
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.380]   saying and it would be great.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.380]   You'll have that.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.140]   I think they should also have like this thing that if you go unconscious while you're listening
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.980]   to one and automatically stops the book.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.980]   I don't know.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   Heartache monitor.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.460]   If it falls in your face.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.460]   You're reading just knows.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.260]   That's all it needs is like a little you know gyroscope.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.260]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:20.820]   I think Apple could be asleep again and the kid will give you a black eye.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.820]   Just a little notion.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.580]   That's actually that's why I switched.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.580]   Why is that?
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.260]   Because I knew if I ever fell asleep reading my iPad and that fell on my face.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.260]   That was not going to be.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.260]   But this is not going on.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.260]   It's a safety issue.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.260]   She could sleep with it would be no problem at all.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.140]   Oh, and it doesn't even get smudged.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   That's nice.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.420]   That's really nice.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.300]   Interesting consumer reports.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.980]   I don't know if this hurt the father's day sale of the Kindle for the first time ever
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.860]   gave the nook their number one rating at just above the Kindle.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:05.260]   The Barnes and Noble Nook simple touch reader is the new consumer reports best reader.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.060]   That thing looks great.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.060]   I've not used it yet.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:14.180]   But the E-ink and its touch screen which is pretty amazing.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.820]   How do they do that?
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.820]   I don't know.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.700]   I mean the reports you know the few reviews I've read of it said it works great.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.900]   And Amazon absolutely has to match that very soon.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.620]   Obviously you know consumer reports is one thing saying that this is better.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.420]   But other you know other places I've been saying that this is this is the absolute future
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.980]   of this E-ink technology.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.060]   The question is you know Amazon's been rumored for some time now by the end of this year
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.260]   to come out with a whole slew of tablets.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.500]   You know maybe an Android based one and then but do they they'll probably keep you know
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.540]   dedicated e-reader one and they absolutely have to match that future now I think.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   No one would ever bet on Barnes and Noble beating Amazon in the long run.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.740]   I didn't think Barnes and Noble was going to go anywhere with the nook especially after
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.380]   seeing the first nook which was God awful I guess you know is really the only one I
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.380]   think.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.540]   My mom had one and I've never seen her so frustrated with the device and I've never
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.180]   been so frustrated with the device.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.060]   That was the one with the color strip at the bottom and then the E-ink above it was at
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.060]   it.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.740]   Yeah it was ludicrous it couldn't get online it was impossible I mean it was just it was
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.380]   a terrible device and it was so unintuitive it was just shocking it was like worse than
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.740]   a blackberry storm.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.540]   But the new one is I mean that new nook with the touchscreen E-ink screen is fantastic
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.140]   that's what that's actually what I would get if I were upgrading right now.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.140]   Interesting.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.660]   Although I think maybe Amazon has a slightly better book selection.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.300]   Well one of the pluses that's Consumer Reports sites is that you can there's support for
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.020]   ebook loans from public libraries.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.300]   I will never understand this because if you get it if you you know you could buy an ebook
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.900]   but if you get it from the library like it expires after two weeks like a regular library
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.860]   book like there's a limited supply.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.860]   Alright.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   I don't.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.860]   It's kind of weird.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.540]   It's very it seems antiquated.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:04.260]   Yeah and then can you just rent it again do you have to wait a certain amount of time
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.020]   yeah then you go back to the library and you say I want to renew it you're going to renew
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.940]   my ebook I just it's Tom.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.980]   But I think it's the publishers right that's probably who's to write of course.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   Right of course.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.980]   They're free.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.980]   They're free.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.540]   That's still maybe the best model to get a book for free if you're going to borrow it.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.180]   I mean I know it seems weird to borrow although really you know you're borrowing a lot of
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.140]   digital content when you stream it or you use any kind of subscription service it seems
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.980]   okay to me that that's a free one.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:32.980]   It just feels strange.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.980]   It's not it's like you know I understood that I had to return the book because the library
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.980]   only had a limited number of copies.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.980]   That kind of made sense to me.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.580]   I guess I was returning the book for the wrong reason.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:51.380]   Apparently according to Reuters there's a big issue with with spam on the Kindle.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:39:04.420]   The self published ebooks apparently are jammed with thousands of books that are crap or advertising
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.660]   or you know nothing.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:14.580]   It's kind of a scam right people are buying these DVDs full of just shoveled wear books
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.620]   and throwing them up and trying to get 99 cents a piece for them.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.060]   So there is books but there are copies.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:30.380]   It seems to be just for you wear rip off rip offs of other books and then in other cases
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.580]   they're just kind of random content.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.980]   It's not fake content necessarily.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   It's just a big Laura Mipson ripped off.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   Over and over again.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.980]   Do it yourself spam.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.380]   I bet people are making money on it.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.660]   I mean that's just that actually really more than anything shows that there's a good market
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.660]   for ebooks.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:53.740]   It's a shame though because I think the self publishing model is one that is delicate.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.740]   I agree.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:00.220]   It's the kind of thing where if the consumer starts to distrust that it results in a lot
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.780]   of people who really would benefit from having their work read not getting that exposure
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   anymore.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.020]   And it casts a poll on the idea of doing it at all.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.540]   You know if you were a public if you were an author who was just starting to get into
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.220]   the idea of self publishing it's kind of like you know when online dating was sort of the
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.860]   ghetto thing to do and people start to feel like oh self publishing is just is just in
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.020]   the same bucket as spam all the time.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.020]   It will kind of kill.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.860]   I mean I hope Amazon snaps too and starts doing some quality control to combat this
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.540]   problem quickly.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.300]   Did you get an auto reminder from Google chat by the way to call dad?
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.820]   I got I have one I have one staring me at the in the face right now.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.900]   So they actually did better get on that.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:46.820]   You have if you have the G chat thing opened up in either Gmail or I Google or one of the
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.860]   things right under your main status message you know they have the phone call feature
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.540]   thing I think you have to install plug into actually get it to work but it says right
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.620]   under there a reminder called dad period.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.620]   They added it to your task list.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.580]   They had an on the homepage too underneath the Google underneath the doodle.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.820]   It says called dad.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.700]   However you call him or you know makes something something about your dad and then make sure
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.700]   you call him on Google.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.300]   You feel like this is like Larry Page has some guilt going on or something and it's
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.580]   just he's just manifesting this.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:21.620]   I mean I think that if more women worked at that company it would pop up with call mom
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.420]   not just on Mother's Day just randomly all the time call your mother.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:31.620]   She's waiting when's the last time you call us how long before Google starts monitoring
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.100]   how often you call your mom.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.540]   I would do I would like that actually help you haven't called your mother in three days
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.860]   fourteen hours and twenty three minutes.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:46.740]   I wish my iPhone just wouldn't work until I call my mom.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:50.380]   I think your mom wishes that as well Jeff I think you better start calling her.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.980]   I try to turn on Twitter and my Twitter app won't load unless I call mom first.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.900]   I think that would be better.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.340]   I tell my mom just watch Twit Live I'm thinking of you.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.620]   Yeah and that way she actually does she watches Twit Live so I'm just looking at my
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:08.940]   chat I didn't get that maybe they I don't know maybe they know something about you
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:14.620]   MG that they might I haven't called my dad yet so I do have to see you see you see you
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.620]   see yeah right.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:24.180]   Never mind I was going to tell a joke but I'll leave that out will do we'll be back
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.980]   in just a moment I want to talk a little bit about backing up your data this is what you
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.940]   should do you should call your dad and say dad if you backed up your data lately I actually
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:36.740]   talked to my dad last week and he I asked him about I believe it or not this is the kind
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:42.100]   of conversation to tell me about your backup strategy father and he didn't have a very
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.420]   good one he really didn't he had he said well I have this USB key and every once in
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:52.580]   a while I put it in my computer and I copy something onto it dad you need carbonite.com
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.820]   I want you to I want you all to tell your dads about carbonite.com it's backup done right
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.900]   it's for several reasons versus automatic so you don't have to think about it it's all
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.620]   the time as long as you're online it's backing up so you don't ever get behind you know once
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.740]   you get that first backup done you're gonna you're gonna always have copies of everything
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:16.900]   it does some nice stuff like you can always visit your data it's not you know it's available
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.180]   online even before a disaster happens you just log into your carbonite account from any computer
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.340]   or your iPhone or your iPad or your Android phone or your blackberry and there's your
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:30.180]   stuff you can turn on encryption so only you can see the data you control the past key
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:34.420]   and of course they always use 128-bit SSL so it's always secure as your files go back
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:40.260]   and forth and restore is very simple you just click of the mouse away best part is this
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.300]   is not expensive for a PC or Mac unlimited backup of your internal drive everything on
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:50.420]   your laptop for instance just fifty nine dollars a year sixteen cents a day and if you use

[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:35.220]   on sega's been hacked hackers stole data you gotta wonder if this you don't Jeff is
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:39.260]   this related you think to the Sony hacks or do you just hackers figure let's go after
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:43.460]   all the game machine yeah I think it's uh... it's a floodgates opened up and it's like
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:49.340]   oh let's do it it's that's that seemed like fun one point two nine million customers
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:56.780]   personal data email addresses dates of birth uh... however sega says payment information
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.740]   is safe
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.380]   it's interesting to me you know there's so many of these companies that are uh...
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.900]   getting into the the e-commerce scene it's it
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.380]   brick and mortar has been
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.580]   not the preferred method from publishers for a long time now and I think that that's
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.340]   only going to continue in more more of these companies are having their own dedicated
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:21.380]   online services and and it's interesting that as we get more different kinds of companies
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:26.580]   offering that kind of service to the user having your data with all these different
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.140]   companies they're opening themselves up to that kind of attack and where you know selling
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.900]   stuff in a brick and mortar store or having only a few companies that you give your money
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:40.660]   to like an amazon or whatever they sort of offload that responsibility to a third party
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:45.700]   uh... and you saw a a having this weird thing this week with uh...
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.100]   with steam where some of their titles were having to be taken off and and put back on
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.140]   because there's competing sites all trying to
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   have exclusive to games so
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.500]   having more different places where your data is stored i think
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.380]   it is a is a liability to the companies i mean the companies themselves are taking on
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.300]   that responsibility rather than
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.140]   having a storefront do it
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.500]   i do like this though if you think it was not
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.780]   uh... lulcek
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.180]   that did this though the people are claiming responsibility for the playstation and i
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.300]   can fact lulcek
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.020]   on their twitter feed said
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.900]   hey that's not right he said they say we want to help you destroy the hackers that
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.300]   attacked you say that we love the dream cast
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.740]   so childish right
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.980]   that's people are going down it says is because the dream cast has some kind of
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.500]   weird
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.100]   there
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.300]   it does people love the dream cast
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.100]   yeah they still love the game cast
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.780]   it's such a childish mentality right it's like all we like to be kept in case you
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.900]   guys are good
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.260]   so he's evil
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.260]   is bizarre
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.540]   molly and they can't responsibility for hack
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.620]   Nintendo
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.580]   like
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.380]   nintendo that this week puppy of the game world is is to eminently hackable but
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.820]   like segasm limits
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.140]   apparently
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.700]   this is thirteen year old logic at work yeah
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.020]   i'm not gonna say anything bad about well sec
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.460]   i love them
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.460]   i'm not
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.740]   i'm not
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:15.260]   i'm starting with disaster right now i love them i love the dream cast
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.300]   i still have mine somewhere now somebody i don't know if this is true i just
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.580]   somebody in the chat room a couple hours ago said
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.460]   that mount gov mount gox had been how it has it's been hacked as well that's
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.500]   good news
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.020]   so got what
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.980]   empty gox that's the uh...
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.700]   the bitcoin exchange
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.820]   i know why the good news
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.980]   no it's bad news
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.660]   and it's yes
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.860]   uh...
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.700]   first of all we heard that somebody had had i don't know how half a million
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.420]   dollars worth of bitcoins
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.580]   uh... but apparently somebody had half of that half a million dollars with the
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.860]   bitcoins in their account
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.540]   last monday
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.060]   those uh... twenty five thousand bitcoins are transferred from four hundred seventy
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.820]   eight accounts
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.820]   on mount gox
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:57.700]   and now
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.140]   mount gox
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.820]   is admitting to a major breach in a shutdown
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.020]   yeah i just got an email from them about that actually
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.380]   are you a bit cleaner
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.860]   well you know here's the funny thing
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.500]   i've been trying to ride the bitcoin bubble and it takes forever to like set
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.980]   up your wallet account and then transfer money into your wallet
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.420]   and then transfer money from your dollar counter your empty gox account
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.140]   and that and so as all of as i'm going through this entire process
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.740]   you know that the bitcoins crash happens and it goes from thirty to eleven
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.060]   and i'm like yes score
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.220]   and then the next thing i know i finally get it all transferred in and i go to
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.540]   log in today
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.260]   and i've got this there's a note right at the front of the says they've suspended
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.460]   trading
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.860]   the huge sell-off it went down to a penny
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.660]   what does those a penny
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.860]   yeah it was thirty bucks
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.460]   and also the but they suspended trading they said they're gonna return it to
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.940]   seventeen dollars
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.300]   once they deal with what they think is a trojan actually think that the
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.220]   stealing all of debts
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.540]   yeah and that they think maybe the twenty five thousand coins that were taken
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.420]   i think originally it was reported they were on a laptop but now it sounds like
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.260]   they're blaming a trojan for that
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.300]   right so this is a flaw in bitcoin you have a wallet dot dot dot file that has
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.180]   your wallet is just sitting there on your hard drive
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.540]   and you're supposed to back it up if you don't there goes your money
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.380]   and if somebody steals it i guess they could steal your money so a little flaw
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.500]   you don't mean you
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.660]   it's a it's a little uh marketplace at the moment i would not recommend putting
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.980]   like a ton of money in there
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.980]   wow
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.140]   i'm still gonna do it though are you
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.460]   i'm not gonna put a ton of money in there we are gonna do it
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:33.780]   well so i've been running a bitcoin server for a few months and i got nothing
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.740]   you're farming
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.580]   i've been farming but you know uh
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.260]   steve gibson ran it and like in three days he got fifty coins
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.100]   so i don't know
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.420]   the bitcoin will be back to around seventeen and a half dollars per bitcoin
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.460]   after we roll back all trains
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.500]   see this okay i'm sorry but this that's it all
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.300]   confidence is gone if they can even do that
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.020]   they're gonna roll back all trades that happened
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.500]   uh this morning
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.540]   what's concerning about that is that they had a massive sell-off and then i'm
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.860]   sure that they had a ton of people who bought in
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.140]   right damn i'm gonna get in at two dollars or a penny or whatever which i
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.060]   would have done if i weren't getting a pedicure
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.860]   uh and i mean i have my priority is in order
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:20.820]   absolutely absolutely but it seems it does seem a little concerning that they
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.940]   can be like you know what we're dark net rolls up in here so
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.980]   we'll make it up we make it up you can have that bitcoin
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:33.380]   so if you go to bitcoin that's what they have they have basically a blog post
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.780]   that's it
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.100]   i mean not not bitcoin not gox so we should explain mount gox is
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.660]   a uh exchange but there are many exchange bitts coin has no central server
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.060]   no centralized anything
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.260]   um it's very strange
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.540]   and then of course if you go to uh uh the silk road
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.820]   oh you can buy all sorts of stuff with bitcoin
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.900]   seeds stems whatever you want
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.500]   it's not just for low strogas
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.780]   um it's a backup currency for when the info apocalypse comes
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.940]   is that what you're planning for yeah i don't want the dark net to leave me
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.820]   behind no
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.220]   no maybe i can buy their love with bitcoin
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.740]   save me dark net from the info apocalypse
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:29.060]   you can you can buy yeah you can buy just about anything on uh silk road
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.060]   with bitcoin is that what you're saving up for
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.260]   there's actually there are a bunch of different sites now and people who are
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.460]   accepting payment in bitcoin really see that's the thing until i can use it for
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.940]   something i want i don't know i think like eff i want to say or epic one or
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.220]   one or both of those accepting donations in bitcoin now
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.980]   there are various tech consultants who are accepting their fees in bitcoin
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.660]   is this kind of like the uh digital equivalent of uh
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:59.540]   at the roller rink when you had the ski ball tickets yes exactly like oh man i
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.420]   really want the the boombox but it's like 500 000 tickets
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.660]   like only i can just keep playing ski ball for 27 years
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:13.380]   kind of kind of like that it's a i mean it's it's it's it is becoming
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:17.140]   an interesting alternate it's interesting just as an experiment right because it
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:20.740]   has become an alternate economy well and it's annoying the senate which i
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.420]   think is great it's what it annoys the senate
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.300]   the u_s_ senate two senators in the u_s_ senate have
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.180]   have demanded after looking at silk road and i don't know how they found it you
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.900]   have to be running tour even to look at it
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.900]   so somebody must have shown him a picture but after looking at silk road they say
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.060]   oh my god there's drugs and they're actually trying to ban bitcoin they
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.540]   want to they want to ban bitcoin
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.100]   well and i don't think they want to ban it for the drug reasons i think they
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.740]   want to ban it because i mean bitcoin is fundamentally an
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.700]   archaic at nature right the idea is that it is a
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.380]   it's an alternate system of currency that will undermine
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.900]   the the global banking system right like that is the that is the hope of the
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:04.020]   decentralized kind of darknet um and and that is potentially terrifying
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.180]   i guess if it takes off sounds like something john c_d_vore i can add
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.740]   them curry thought up
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.140]   that's all i can say i bet they're all over bickling oh i'm sure they are are they
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.900]   john yes yes
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.340]   they're trying to bury it in their backyard and they haven't figured out a way to do
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.100]   it but any day now
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.060]   um
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:33.540]   now they're now i tried to download the database of the lulls sec database and
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.740]   search for my name but i the last time i checked i couldn't get it
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:42.020]   has anybody done that there's like a 24 megabyte download
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:47.700]   that you know i just assume they have it i just assume they have it right yeah
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:52.740]   yeah i got um when i had uh after the sony hack you know they uh they shut
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.060]   down my credit card my credit card company shut it down and
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.820]   uh yeah they wouldn't tell me specifically that it was sony but i got a
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.300]   you know message from sony saying that my uh
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.540]   my data was one of the ones compromised so i'm sure that's exactly what it was
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:10.180]   oh this is interesting i guess i mean i tried to download and i couldn't find
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.420]   it now there is a widget online
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:19.060]   has this is from cloud controlled dot com has lulls sec
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.580]   leaked your personal details so i'm going to type in leo
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:27.380]   at leoville.com and i will check let's see
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:33.140]   my details have not been leaked any anybody want to check
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:42.500]   no this is l u l z s e c dot cloud controlled dot com
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.940]   so you could see whether they know who are these people
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:51.700]   we actually got a call on our show on buzz out loud from a guy and trenidad
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:56.580]   who blessed his heart took it upon himself in some kind of fit a boy scout
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:01.540]   behavior to call a woman who was on the list who he did not know
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:05.460]   wow and tell her that her information had been compromised and she should do
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.020]   something
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.860]   you know i'm calling from trenidad and you are in trouble lady
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.500]   yes are you the prince that i sent my money to
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:21.380]   ha ha ha i'm so happy you're calling she got kind of scared she put her kid on
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:25.620]   the phone i don't understand this tech stuff let me
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:31.220]   give you my son why are you calling me why are you bugging me go away
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.180]   try to help you your account's been compromised yeah
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:40.260]   sam's song says uh we know we know apple you stole the idea for our new nexus
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:46.340]   for your iphone five any credibility to that
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:50.500]   where do you now i know i know mg that you probably uh following this very
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.180]   closely uh i i've been watching some of the
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.620]   the this whole thing is is actually kind of funny you know it's uh
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:02.420]   samsung demanding to see the iphone five that i can read yeah
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:06.100]   uh you know like like there's any way in hell apple's going to let them see
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.460]   that and then of course apple coming back at them now and saying
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:13.700]   um actually your three most recent devices are also copycats of our
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.860]   devices so they just keep piling this on they're just going back and forth this
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:22.340]   is uh this is fun to watch yeah apple says samsung's an even bigger copycat
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.100]   than we thought they've amended their original complaint
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:30.820]   and they now they just call sam's song the copyist
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.460]   that's really fun yeah they've barely stayed out of the sandbox with that one
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:43.700]   barely you mean or you're a copyist stop copying me
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.900]   i don't know we'll i hate to cover even cover these
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.780]   lawsuits because you know they're going to go on for years and we never will
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:53.220]   know and then they'll settle they always settle right some kind of settlement
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:57.700]   happening uh new york post uh doing something
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.180]   not surprising considering it's you know the new york post and rupa mr doc
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:07.300]   uh they're actually blocking uh ipad uh safari visitors
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:12.340]   when you try to go to the york post online using a browser on the ipad
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.700]   it says using only one specific browser right because you can still use sky
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:23.140]   fire in the other ones it says um hey you should be using our app instead
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:28.260]   that's just so broken it's just so crazy
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.940]   that is that is the nightmare future of devices it is isn't it
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:36.100]   the whole idea of like the daily is absolutely terrifying to me because it
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.820]   just encourages people to balkanize their content
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.420]   and and break the web
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:45.700]   why would you even do that i mean doesn't it just turn away traffic
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:49.060]   you think that sells ipad apps i don't think so
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:53.060]   i'm not gonna go oh gosh i should have bought the uh post ipad app
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:58.260]   well if they if they have some like huge story then yes maybe you know that
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.060]   people absolutely want to get to and they have you know they have this
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.340]   exclusive info on it then yeah maybe that will help but otherwise no like
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.140]   today they don't have anything big that i know of any way you know that's not
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:11.300]   going to help them sell the app any but but a good uh a good counter argument to
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.180]   that is what i think fortune did right when they had
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.780]   supposedly that you know inside look in apple and they sold it only in their
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.140]   app at first that was awesome and you're right there that was smart because i
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:24.260]   i almost bought the fortune app because of that
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.860]   i think a lot of people did because of that i don't know it was 499 right you
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.380]   had to buy that issue of fortune right right yeah i think a lot of people
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.460]   did and uh you know in that regard maybe maybe that model
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.980]   works but is that really is it scalable you know to the
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.340]   to every kind of thing i mean this is all about getting information then of
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.620]   course and then you would have to be able to time it correctly if you had
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:50.580]   like a big exclusive story and then you would release it first uh via the app or
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.860]   or another mechanism payment mechanism paywall or whatever
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:57.540]   but i'm just not sure that there's enough of that information out there that
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.260]   would be people would be willing to pay that much
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.340]   for that it would scale like you know to enough to make an actual business
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:07.940]   i just find i just find it very curious to see how many people
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:11.140]   actually bought the fortune app because of that i mean i think a lot of people
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:17.460]   almost did but knowing how long exclusive is last i can't i don't think that is
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:21.220]   a sustainable or good way to disseminate information i resented
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:25.380]   i resented it so much that i only you know i wanted to read it i really wanted
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:29.220]   to read that article and i didn't buy it because i resented it so much
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:33.060]   i did buy it and i'll you know i'm sure you read it after the fact it
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:35.780]   probably wasn't worth five dollars i mean there was some good info there it was
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.220]   an interesting read but there wasn't any new information besides some of the
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.380]   executive team so if you trick somebody and spend 499 you better damn well have
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:46.500]   499 worth of something there you're really never going to get money from
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.780]   them again yeah that's even worse speaking of never getting money
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.660]   because if you have 499 it's a
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:57.220]   second and if you do have 499 worth of something there then maybe it's like a
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.900]   Watergate story right in which days it would be totally unconscionable and the
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.860]   worst sort of journalism behind a paywall and sort of
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.580]   trickle it out i mean anything that you're trying to trickle out is just
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.460]   something that you're proud of it's kind of an ego play that's a good point and
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.340]   nobody should have to pay for that if you're in the business of disseminating
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:17.620]   information and just get it out there that's a very good point
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.660]   i don't like it i don't like it one bit
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.180]   speaking of what you don't like okay so uh let's we didn't get the review of
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:29.060]   duke nukem forever great game uh yeah you can avoid it
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.740]   worth waiting 14 years for to be quite honest with you i have not played the
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:36.740]   whole thing um we i played enough of it at at preview events to know that it
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.060]   wasn't going to be my cup of tea and there were enough
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:43.140]   exciting games coming out this week that we we skipped it for trs but really
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.900]   uh yeah child of eden came out the same day and it's it's a pretty interesting
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:52.260]   pretty interesting game but yeah duke is um it's sad you know it seems like
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:57.780]   gearbox really wanted to to make a duke nukem game and i think there's a lot of
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:01.460]   there's a lot of speculation that the next duke nukem game will be the game that
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.060]   they wanted to make but uh this one just sort of had to come out in
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:07.540]   order to get that franchise off the ground i think it could have been a
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:12.180]   really interesting franchise to look at in a kind of ironic self-aware way
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.140]   where we have this kind of anachronistic character
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.380]   who behaves in a way that doesn't really fit in in modern times you know he's
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.620]   sort of that Arnold Schwarzenegger brash guy and this game seems to take
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:28.020]   itself very seriously and in a in a way that people don't really
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.300]   appreciate any sort it also sounded gross i mean just too many penis and
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.980]   poop jokes yeah yeah any other game that came out
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:40.020]   uh last year called bullet storm that was crass and over the top in a
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:44.900]   similarly juvenile way uh and it was really kind of funny and self-aware
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.020]   and interesting and ironic and i think pretty well written
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:53.140]   uh and could have been a similarly uh off-putting kind of experience but
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.620]   wasn't and it's too bad that duke nukem which has the sort of marquee value
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:02.420]   that both strong did not have was that off-putting experience here's a child
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.820]   of edan what is this what is this game it's sort of the first real
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:12.420]   uh hardcore game for the connect it's a young so there i am
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.220]   yeah yeah and i'm touching fish oh jellyfish
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.980]   now uh there's this designer named tatsuyo mezaguchi and he's done a few games
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.660]   of one of which is called res which is sort of a dream cast
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.940]   um yeah i remember us yeah um shooter that has a lot of of geek cred
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.540]   and this is kind of a spiritual successor to that it's an on-rails shooter where
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.340]   you actually can control it with the connect moving your hands
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.380]   across targets painting targets and then you
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.020]   shoot your hand out in front of you to release
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:46.180]   the your laser beams uh and then you use your other hand to shoot a different
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.300]   kind of weapon so you're really playing physically with the game
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.900]   but it's a shooter and it works really really well this cutscene we're
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.180]   watching is this anything to do with the gameplay or is it just
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.700]   yeah i mean that guy is uh acting a little more
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.060]   intensely than one might but it you know it's definitely
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:06.740]   the the concept of the game yeah you're you are controlling the game physically
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.620]   it's like lawn morn man it's the it's the
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.660]   oh a play manifestation of a lawn morn man you know yeah
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.060]   plus that is visually stunning it's pretty
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.740]   mesmerized oh it's gorgeous and mouth is hanging open like a dork
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.660]   yeah the cool thing too is that you it's integrated with music then the music
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.300]   in the game is really created by your movements and your uh the shooting of
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.780]   different targets so you're creating the rhythm
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:33.540]   and the beat of the music as you play which is something that that designer
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.420]   has been doing for a long time he did space channel five which sort of was
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.260]   the first dance rhythm game um and luminesse which was another
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   music integrated into puzzle game um it's really really spectacular to watch
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.140]   and and the the connect integration works really well
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.580]   it doesn't require connect either that's it's oh you don't you can use it now you
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.900]   can play it with a control i feel if you only have that
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.020]   i'll have to try it looks that looks very in it all right it's it looks
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.980]   innovative which is great it really is it's the it's
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:06.020]   i think it's the first proof that that technology can work for a more hardcore
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.860]   audience yeah uh oh you really you think connect
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.860]   spin casual gamers mostly up to this point yeah they've only really had those
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.540]   mini-game collections and the jumper on your room and be silly kind of family
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.860]   stuff which is fine and it has proven to sell very very well
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.940]   but the hardcore has been asking where's our game with this tech and i think
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.660]   child living is the first of those and they showed more
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:33.460]   at e3 as well we uh at the e3 southern nintendo we you which won't be out till
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.620]   next year uh a tablet kind of kindle size tablet with
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.220]   controls on it excel a radar accelerometer and a gyroscope
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:46.820]   um touch screen um what do you think
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:51.540]   i was kind of perplexed by the messaging of of their unveiling of that device but
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.460]   after i got my hands on it i was a little more sold on the idea
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:59.060]   it's uh it's pretty fun what they were showing so far
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:03.540]   it are these games where you you can have a solo experience on the screen in
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.500]   front of you while other people are having a different experience
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:11.380]   on the your television and for that kind of party environment which is kind
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.900]   of how the we the original we works as best as well
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.820]   it's really fun it remains to be seen how that's going to be
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:23.860]   used in just single-player experiences uh ubi soft was showing a a shooter that
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.380]   was built for the device that you know where you kind of looked through your
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:30.900]   screen to to shoot and use the accelerometer and gyroscope to
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.820]   to aim and i don't think that's not going to be a sustainable application for the
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.180]   tech but it'll be interesting to see what other kind of weird things they
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:42.340]   have in mind for this device it really is the the ds
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.540]   for the for the home you know you have this well that's what it reminded me of
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.380]   is of the ds because you had two screens yeah i think there's going to be a lot
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:53.460]   of ds games that will be ported into hd and turned
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.780]   that kind of experience will be translated onto into a bigger
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:03.060]   palette you know i have to say i was so sad uh
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.180]   changing the subject a little bit i went to youtube to watch uh rebecca
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:10.820]   black's friday and i got this message as you do every friday yeah
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:15.540]   no i do it it's a friday tradition i make the staff listen to it
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.780]   rebecca black friday this video is no longer available due to a copyright
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:30.100]   claim by rebecca black what that girl is cashing in she cashing in
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:35.460]   i mean that it showed up it showed up on friday appropriately enough on vivu
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:40.580]   uh so if you really have to watch it yeah isn't she about i think
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.340]   was that it's a two-month period like i'm assuming they have a better rev
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:48.820]   share deal and she's using it she's in minute 19 every 15 minutes of
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:55.220]   fame i uh but how many views does it have right now 180 million is that
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.340]   something like that i don't think does anybody like to view it i think it's
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:03.220]   too late for rev share at this point everybody's seen it and wants to
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.060]   uh um i don't know why why bother at that point
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:11.700]   maybe you want to ask alexia totsis why she says she misses it the mg you might
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.860]   just you know corner her and say yes i would i would like to get an answer
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:21.300]   she said she's missing it she's the one who caught it she needs to know
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.300]   what day comes after friday uh and she can't everyone's in one i need to

[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.020]   awesome also also what's there to know you know it's like it's not a difficult
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:52.900]   song to remember it's like three concepts in it and friday is uh which
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.020]   is supposed to do on friday the day of the week
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:00.100]   we know the seven words
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.300]   maybe we all watch the hitler reacts version yeah
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.460]   yeah that was inevitable um what does he say the three people who haven't seen
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.540]   this video stay here everybody else leave the room
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.100]   so yeah
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:17.860]   uh apparently uh netflix is doing better than uh even sony thought sony had a
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.860]   deal with the stars channel for netflix streaming
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.220]   and uh everybody freaked out the other day once sony's movies were suddenly
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.860]   pulled from netflix streaming well it turns out
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:34.420]   sony says well stars reached the limit on the number of times those movies could
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:39.060]   be viewed so we got to revise our deal
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:44.100]   looks crazy what crazy it's just it's really it is so exhausting at this
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.700]   point like when it get on the stick and then your way
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.460]   your method of dealing with that discovery that you pull them down
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.220]   wildly popular on netflix is to disappear the content yeah
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.420]   from netflix like you're some sort of dumbass mafia
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.740]   yeah everybody out of the pool yeah that's it
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.340]   we're taking our ball and going home this post on friday
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.900]   from netflix vp of content acquisition pauline fissure
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:14.580]   uh you may have noticed sunny movies are not available
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.260]   this is a result of a temporary contract issue between sony and stars and
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:23.140]   while we while these two valued partners work through their differences
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.260]   we want you to look at the fighter skyline and ironman too as well as the
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:30.820]   first four seasons of madmen please please

[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.540]   and then um and then you could of course create
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:08.180]   your own site very simply very easily i just i'm a big squarespace fan there
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:13.620]   they are all right they're cute give it a try today squarespace.com/twit
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:18.180]   it's a secret behind exceptional websites you probably have your own
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:23.700]   squarespace code jeff cannot i bet you we do yes
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:28.500]   i mean my personal site's on squares but i love it i love the app integration
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.940]   the ipad and the iphone apps are fantastic yeah they're great
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.380]   i was just you know it's funny i we had a call on the radio show today with
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:38.100]   i felt sorry for the poor guy i had an i-web
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.340]   site right and he said well what's gonna happen and i had to tell him in june
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.940]   2012 you won't have a site anymore apples just gonna oh yeah
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.940]   chop you're not only they're gonna and the problem with i-web
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.820]   is you know it's not like you can then use some other tool you've
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.540]   designed something that's completely incompatible with the rest of the world
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.140]   and so what i want to do is and i gotta i gotta call uh danny and Anthony over
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:04.980]   there at uh squarespace they would do so well if they would
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.420]   write an i-web importer tool yeah i mean something would not be
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.660]   brilliant and you say look we'll host it you push a button it gets your gets
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:19.220]   your site over here looks the same hosting done
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.100]   they have an importer tool tool for a lot of other ones don't they?
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:26.500]   yeah wordpress and all those yeah and actually uh uh this might be a
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.700]   chance to save posturists because i'm a big posturist fan i think tumblers
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.980]   just eating their lunch and didn't posturists for a while
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.740]   do or posturists do uh like they would have an importer a day
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.740]   yeah they were they uh they pissed off a lot of yes they did a lot of their
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.780]   competitors because yeah they did it with tumbler they did it with wordpress
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.900]   and they would make it as easy as possible and it was in some cases just
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.540]   one click of a button to move everything over that you had
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.300]   i loved that maybe they should maybe they should do an i-web importer
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:59.060]   maybe they should all right pandaora ipo this week uh both the pandaora group
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.940]   on have something in common neither of them
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.860]   uh are well is is group on profitable or are they spending every penny them
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:09.380]   they're spending every penny they make aren't they yeah i grew up yeah they're
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:13.220]   uh they're underwater quite a bit because of their international spending right now
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:17.780]   right uh pandaora was i think profitable for a little bit but they've since dipped below
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.980]   and they're going to go worse because it's going to cost them more and more
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.820]   for the use of they've they've really got to you know of course they say that they'll
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:28.740]   they're working on things and they haven't figured out but uh it is a problem um
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:33.060]   the more popular they become the more costly it is for them to run their
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.180]   business because they have to pay these royalty fees for
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:42.100]   to all the labels so pandaora did an ipo they they were priced at 16 bucks that's
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.260]   that that was the price that if you were an institutional investor
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:51.060]   you know you had friends in was three whatever you could get it for 16 bucks
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.980]   right opens at 20 now if you were smart you sold the media
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.980]   uh it closed at 17 dollars and 42 cents
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:05.700]   uh it is now down uh i think 13 bucks something like that it's it's below it's
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:10.260]   under uh it's opening price considerably right yeah i mean
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:13.700]   i i pandaora has been a really interesting compared to what happened to linkedin
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.540]   linkedin obviously when they had p oed it exploded and people were like oh my god
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:20.420]   you know it this went across the board it went from everyone saying times are
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.180]   great too this is the definite indication of another bubble happening right now
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:27.940]   i think the pandaora thing is actually in many ways good what's been happening
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.180]   because it shows that people aren't just going crazy over the stuff right now
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.180]   you know there is actually some thinking some sanity and some thinking going on
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:40.500]   to the way this should be you know when when pandaora first uh put out their s1
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.100]   filing to to go public i think the the initial price that they had was
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.900]   something like eight dollars and they opted a little bit to 11
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.340]   before finally doing the 16 dollar price that they that they eventually
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.420]   opened with but so it's not like you know they knew too like maybe it should be a
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.100]   little bit low lower and they were just kind of reacting to i guess the way that
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.380]   the market was uh was shaping up at the time but i think it's good you know if
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.940]   they stay in kind of this 10 to 20 dollar range which is seems reasonable
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:11.060]   what's gonna happen with group on i would hope that something similar happens
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:15.060]   with group on actually because they're in a little bit of a similar boat in that
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.980]   they have an easily replicatable business idea that in fact they have competitors
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:23.060]   coming out of the woodworks of spotify ends up here within the next few weeks
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:26.900]   like it looks like they finally might i can't i'm sorry not spotify living
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:30.740]   social is i was going back to spotify pandora
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:35.220]   it's literally confusing my bubble ish's ipos of money bubbles
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.220]   so little time little time um but you're right anybody could do a group on
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:42.020]   that but there is i hear that i hear people say there's this
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.700]   low barrier to entry but but one of the things you have to do and look at group
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.580]   on you have to hire a lot of salespeople because you got low salespeople
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:51.300]   everywhere i don't know if it's that low yes they're they're strength is the
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.740]   feet on the ground right is is they've got that built-in sales force
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.820]   right they've set i think seven thousand uh sales people or something like that
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.100]   sort of feels like a web band like that's just not that sustainable whereas if
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.260]   facebook and living social with the huge amazon capital and then google
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:09.300]   start to roll out these you know very similar services
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:13.380]   not only do they not have to pay to acquire users but they have built-in
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.260]   sales forces uh so you say that it's the barrier
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.180]   entry for me is not low because i'd have to hire seven thousand salespeople
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.060]   but there are companies on the ground like facebook and google who already
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:26.660]   have people in place yeah they can do it right
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:31.140]   it's rightly pouring money into living social so they're at least they're not
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:34.020]   digging themselves into as much of an investor hole
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:38.260]   right yeah at the same time i mean i i just think that
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.940]   a lot of obviously there was so much love for group hunt to begin with as you
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:46.100]   know as this is exploding and now there was this huge backlash against it of
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:49.540]   course you know leading up to the to the IPO and and all the talk about
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.060]   you know they're losing a lot of money uh i do think that there is still something
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.860]   to be said you know that these guys running it
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:59.540]   did a pretty smart thing they really open this market and now everyone is
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.620]   trying to copy it of course which is a problem
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.820]   but i think that they'll you know they have other ideas about what they want
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.300]   to do i think one of the mistakes that they've made
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.900]   has been trying to so aggressively go with this international stuff
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:13.780]   and that's where they've been losing so much money they're almost they're
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.060]   basically break even in the united states right now but overseas they're
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:20.180]   losing hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter because they're trying to
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:23.540]   expand to you know combat would be chinese
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:27.860]   replicants of the model or uh you know japanese whatever um
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.740]   so i would say stay out of the international market because
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.620]   you just uh you're an american company don't you aren't you at a disadvantage
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:38.020]   look what google's at a disadvantage in china by do just eats their lunch because
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:42.260]   there's a cultural difference and i think i think we're seeing that now i think uh i
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.260]   think sera lacy furtechrunch i wrote an article about this uh either this week
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.540]   or last week talking about how they're going they realize that they now have
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:52.340]   to kind of scale back the amount of spending that they've been doing
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.300]   internationally and hopefully they're able to do that before the ipo
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:23:00.900]   right you know one thing that kind of bugged me a little bit is how much money
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:05.860]   uh group hot founders took off the table from their venture yes that's the other
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.980]   really interesting thing here and that's what's also led to a lot of this
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:13.060]   backlash i mean it's like six percent right people talking about it being a
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.660]   ponzi scheme because you know like everyone's just pouring money into this thing
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.780]   while the while the founders are the ones getting paid for this they can take
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.900]   all them off the table they get an interesting challenge now because they
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.180]   haven't announced the date the timing for their ipo group on
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:30.260]   it could be it could be sooner it could be later and now they have to think boy
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:34.340]   i think the pandora slump might have scared them a little bit
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.700]   sure sure they're looking at linkedin and saying yeah we want that and then
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.020]   pandora oh oh yeah i mean i still think that they have to do it
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:46.180]   relatively soon they uh you know living socials talk about doing it as well so
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:49.940]   they they want to get out there i think as as quickly as they can still
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:54.260]   interesting uh you know i just my advice stay out of the
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:59.300]   tech stock market but who knows i don't know it just seems like you could lose
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.820]   your shirt and stuff well just it's going to go really crazy when
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:06.660]   facebook files to to go public that's what this is all leading up to isn't it
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:09.540]   right right this last week though or the maybe the week before there was a
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.340]   story about how tech stocks in general are about as low as they've been since
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:20.020]   2002 i think so there's some arguments we made for the the possibility that
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.620]   there that some tech stocks are underpriced i think maybe don't you know
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.660]   don't go crazy in the ipo market but i think there's probably some good
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:30.100]   buys out there that i can't participate in
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:34.900]   right at least i'll be saved from you know losing my i'm gonna go and lose
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:40.580]   measured on bitcoin instead of tech stocks so here's the good news geeks who use
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.340]   social networks have more real friends
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.140]   pew the pew center for uh studying of america and the internet or whatever
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:56.820]   the hell it's called uh surveyed uh 2255 american adults last fall found that of
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:03.300]   uh 1,787 internet users 47 percent use of social networking service 92
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:07.540]   facebook 18 percent linkedin twitter 13 percent
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:14.500]   29 percent my space so then they asked people how they use their services
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.780]   and they found that compared to a study that they conducted two years earlier
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.860]   twice as many people are using social networks as before
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:32.340]   and that americans report an average of over two just over two close friends
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:40.500]   which is an increase of over 2008 so that's good news many of us have
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:45.700]   two friends now we only had one in a fraction before
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:52.980]   those who use social networks have even more friends 2.45 friends
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.780]   or maybe they just think these people are their friends that's i think that
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.380]   i think the point is that it's not just geeks using social media anymore and
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.300]   it's normal people now yeah oh that's it the geeks haven't gotten any more
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.620]   friends it's that the uh people with friends have become
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.420]   it's a huge users i was getting my hopes i have to be
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:13.300]   wildly unsocial anti-social even to stay off of the social networks and then
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.300]   says that you're just not going to have you damn friends at all
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:19.380]   oh that's it shoot i was hoping i'd have some more friends
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:24.420]   oh well uh united turn i mean united i'm
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:28.580]   bm turned 100 this week we actually interviewed on
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:31.700]   triangulation on wednesday the guy who invented control alt elite he wrote the
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.820]   bios for the original ibm pc and uh that's kind of impressive that
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:41.220]   ibm is a hundred years old who was it i can't remember who it was was it
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:46.340]   giga ohm somebody did a kind of asked which companies will be around and around
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:49.700]   today i'll be around in a hundred years
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:58.660]   uh not instagram but would will facebook be around in a hundred years
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.060]   wow well ibm has had to reinvent itself a few times several times they're not
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.660]   either not even a hardware company anymore right so that's that's what the
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:09.140]   key is as long as these companies can can reinvent
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.940]   themselves they have to get up to a certain size obviously to sustain
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.820]   themselves through any kind of downturns and things like that but uh
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:17.700]   yeah whoever can reinvent themselves a number of times it's an interesting
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.100]   thing to think about me what are these companies what a hundred years from now
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.060]   first of all what is a hundred years gonna look like i mean who knows
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.020]   but uh microsoft no i don't think they'll be around a hundred years from now
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:30.900]   facebook maybe twitter no i don't think facebook i think amazon could be
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:35.780]   amazon there you go google yeah yeah they're gonna have to reinvent
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.220]   themselves clearly search isn't gonna survive a hundred years
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.100]   not as it is now
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:46.580]   but i would come our even companies like you know
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.940]   ford and gm gonna be around in a hundred years yeah that's a good question
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.060]   i could see you know i could see like a verizon or a Comcast
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.660]   i like amazon i i bet on amazon of all that much that's a good one i would
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:01.940]   definitely bet on amazon apple right now that's that's tricky that'll be a
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.460]   tricky one yeah there's there's uh there's one guy who's
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:09.460]   probably not going to be around in a hundred years yeah we know that
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.500]   right so that's i guess that's an even better question is can apple
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:16.340]   survive after steve's gone but i think i think robot steve jobs will be
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:19.460]   leading the company very well you kind of think that somewhere on the
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:24.900]   kupertino campus there is a small but dedicated group trying to clone
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.220]   steve
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:31.860]   you think i bet they had to roll back i would that's what they're working
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:37.140]   on that was the iweb team right that's what happened to them i'm sure you guys
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.980]   all saw that uh awesome video that i'd be in put out with a person that was
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:45.060]   born every year they can existence love that was amazing yeah if you
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:48.100]   haven't seen it's probably on youtube i can't remember where i saw but yes
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:52.820]   and they just showed that you're every year they say a fact about i bm
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:56.820]   spoken by a person who was born in the year that fact happened
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:01.220]   right and so it starts with people who are extremely uh old and works down to
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:05.540]   just a baby and it's it's very poignant actually moved me i was it was a
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:09.220]   it's credible filmmaking yeah i agree a great concept
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.540]   yeah i don't know whether to give this uh too much
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:19.780]   uh credence but um a senator from uh minnesota
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:25.220]   has proposed a new law senate bill nine seventy eight
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:29.620]   which would toughen copyright laws to the point where you'd get a ten-year
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:36.420]   federal sentence for uploading lip-syncing videos to youtube
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:42.020]   crazy pants there are those who think it's a good idea
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.540]   but for publicly performing copyrighted material the bill
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.980]   actually it's five years i'm sorry five years in prison
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:53.140]   oh well that's so much more much much better it's not the senate judiciary
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:56.340]   committee just passed a proposal that would make
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:00.820]   an illegal or unauthorized streaming a video of movies and television
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:05.140]   af felony if that video even if it's like embedded in your blog
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:09.700]   yeah more than what is it ten times over the course of 180 days
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.340]   and you don't have to uh and you don't have to make money on it
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.940]   it's not like you have to be right what if i'm taking a video
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:19.540]   and i'm walking down the street and someone drives by in their car blaring
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.660]   music can't do it you got to edit that out
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:27.220]   redacted and the thing is that no one really sees kind of the creeping death
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:31.140]   that is this ongoing overreach of copyright and intellectual property
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.580]   law it's like if this were the kind of law that would affect your
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:38.820]   day-to-day civil civil liberties right people would be up in arms about how
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:42.500]   absolutely ludicrous this law writing has become
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:46.420]   and the fact that really the r_a_a_ and the n_p_a_a_ are just handing
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:51.460]   pre-written law out in whatever they whatever state they can come across
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:54.340]   what's the one in tenon c_ there was just something insane passing tenon c_n_
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:58.180]   said the tenc governor was like i didn't really know that guy
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.700]   somebody told me copyright's pretty bad so i signed this law yeah what the hell
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.700]   you know
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:10.180]   it's outrageous senators amy clobuchar of minnesota and john cornron of uh
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:15.380]   cornin of uh... texas uh... have been treated out now remember uh... if you
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:18.660]   if you remember uh... i'm just a bill on capital it does
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:21.540]   just introducing the bill doesn't make it the law yet
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.900]   they've got a long way to go but that's not nine seventy eight
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:29.300]   um under current law reproducing distributed copyright works
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:33.620]   are uh... are federal felony charges
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:37.620]   uh... uh... that includes p_d_p_ transfers and web downloads but streaming is
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:40.820]   considered a public performance it's not it's not illegal it's not a
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.300]   distribution
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.340]   and holding a public performance without a proper licenses not a felony this bill
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.340]   adds public performance
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.420]   to the felony list so now
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.740]   reproducing distributing copy where it works
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.980]   or performing them as the n lip syncing them
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:05.460]   would uh... be a felony facing up to five years in federal prison
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.740]   uh... i think it's what the tenessee law was that was the one that said if you
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:12.500]   share your netflix password with someone all that's good
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.500]   that's a felony
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.540]   yeah that's that's a that's right
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.500]   is to me in a punishable by up to one year in jail and find a twenty five
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.580]   hundred dollars after the higher price tag
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:25.300]   would be a felony now you gotta figure netflix was was the company that pushed
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:26.460]   this right i mean it
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:29.580]   they just some tenessee legislators make this up
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.860]   it was a netflix it was that it was that are a double-an empty a what they were
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.620]   and they were just
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:39.020]   they just write this stuff and they give it to whatever for you to see if it works
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.980]   that's that's that would have been great if it brought up the situation of
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.180]   then you have to read out your friend and say that like he stole your
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.580]   password that's a huge a-jail
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:50.660]   yeah that's good that's how you get off
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:51.140]   it
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.300]   unbelievable what a world we live in my friends
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:57.860]   literally stood up there and said i don't know how bad or problem it is but you
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.540]   know what we got a lot of lobbying about it just in case
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:03.780]   your god
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:06.260]   no wonder molly would just angry as hell
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:12.140]   i'm just i'm just mad as hell and i'm just take my tiny bit to god
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.740]   you'll find molly's rants at scene at

[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:27.300]   and i think that right now

[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.500]   wait a minute i got one right here look at this
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.020]   uh...
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:32.780]   i'm alarmed
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.300]   okay all you know that i won't throw it at you i promise
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.940]   you know what so we're building a new studio molly maybe you don't know this
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.780]   but we're building news i think you know this i follow you on the twitter on the
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:42.500]   twitter
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.300]   so the new studio down the street we're getting close will probably i think we'll
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:46.580]   do this show
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.700]   from the new studio probably as soon as as a month
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.740]   this will be the first to be the first show we do
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:54.380]   but we have a wall when you come in there's a wall
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.540]   behind the receptionist and we're we're putting uh... we're letting people by
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.420]   bricks
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.780]   to help support the studio because for instance
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:05.340]   and if you want to support it right yes it holds the wall up it literally
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:06.780]   literally
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:10.260]   so it doesn't have to say this you could say fifteen characters two lines on the
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:14.700]   four by eight that's a hundred twenty eight bucks you can buy a a replica suitable
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.220]   for throwing through windows
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.300]   but you know don't do that because your names right on there that would be
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:22.220]   kind of a giveaway and then we have uh...
