[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.680]   the show that covers you weeks.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.080]   Tech News.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.280]   And we have a fun panel today.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.360]   I'm really pleased to welcome back Harry McCracken,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.120]   the technologizer from time.com.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.920]   Good to see you, Harry.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.280]   Great to be here.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.960]   Also here, Father Robert Ballister,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   host of this week in Enterprise Tech or Enterprise Show.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.720]   Know how or how to do it show.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.800]   And soon, coding 101, I know you did your beta.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.300]   Yep.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.520]   People were already emailing me.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.000]   Where can I get that show?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240]   We've decided that we're going to back it off a little bit.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080]   I believe our beta was probably a little bit too advanced.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   And thankfully, we have--
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.360]   That's why we do beta.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.920]   We have snails.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.600]   We have snails, right?
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.400]   She said, you know what?
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   I didn't get that.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.280]   Let's break it down.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.160]   Let's break it down.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.760]   Jan says break it down a lot.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.880]   I don't know if that's what she means.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.720]   That's fine.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800]   So coding 101, that'll be--
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.840]   we're in beta for a little while,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.120]   and then we'll have a final version.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.680]   On Thursdays.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.880]   And it's appropriate because this
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.000]   is the Computer Science Education Week starting on Monday.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.600]   Did you know that?
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.680]   And the hour of code?
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.440]   An hour of code?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.200]   I love that idea.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.920]   I love-- this cracks me up, though, on the video for this.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.360]   They've got Will I Am, who is known as a prolific coder.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.240]   He writes a lot of code, doesn't he?
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.600]   Yeah, I think--
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.960]   In between writing hit songs for the Black Eyed Peas,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.760]   and none of us know how to read and write code.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   The first program I wrote asked things
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.200]   like what's your favorite color--
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.320]   Drew from Dropbox?
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.840]   How old are you?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.480]   I wrote a--
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.800]   Bill from Mikey's Off.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   I've heard a code.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.760]   I first learned how to read--
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.920]   Elena from clothia.com.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.880]   Red Square up here on the screen.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.360]   Are you just trying to make something--
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.000]   Chris from the Miami, he's a coder.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.480]   I love it.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720]   He ran into the computer to tablet.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.800]   And then this guy, Mark, works his experience.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.400]   The whole moment of the system is just--
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.640]   He looks so familiar.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.560]   He's a hard-tramp.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   I think I went to school with him.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.240]   I know.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.440]   The programmers of tomorrow--
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.000]   Gabe Newell's--
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.360]   --are the future.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.120]   You know, you're going to look like you have magic powers
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.520]   compared to everybody else.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.960]   Great coders are today's--
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.120]   I do have magic powers.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.920]   That's it.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.800]   I love it.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.760]   So they're encouraging students all over the country
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.880]   to at least just spend an hour learning how to write code.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.360]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.800]   So good for you, coding 101.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.160]   coding 101.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.520]   Perfect way to do that.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.800]   Also here, I'm really thrilled we've
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.720]   been trying to get her on the show for a while.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.520]   But she's been a little busy.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.440]   Jessica Lesson, formerly of the Wall Street Journal,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.080]   now of the information.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.360]   Hi, Jessica.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.800]   Hello.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.320]   So great to have you.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.200]   Congratulations.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.600]   The information launched this week.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.040]   It did.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.840]   We're off to a strong start.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.320]   And it's excited to be out there and able to get feedback
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.040]   on what we're doing.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   Do you call it the information or the information.com?
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.480]   Am I saying it wrong?
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.960]   We call it the information.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.840]   But the information.com is the website.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.360]   Right.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.400]   So either works.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   And the idea is--
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.920]   Jessica, by the way, wrote many, really good
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.440]   byline pieces for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.880]   That's where I first became aware of you.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.440]   We've been trying to get you on Twitch
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.040]   since then, breaking a lot of news there.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.360]   And then I like a lot of people, I think.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.840]   People who've left the Times, left the Journal,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.600]   while Mossberg, Cara Swisher, people like that,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.040]   you decided to do it yourself.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.600]   I suppose that some of the entrepreneurial spirit
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.120]   in the Valley runs off on you.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.080]   But it really boiled down to thinking
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.120]   about sort of our audiences.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   And so at the Journal and I loved working there,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.360]   I felt that the audience was becoming a more general audience.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   And tech and the importance of technology to business
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.560]   was exploding and that there was a demand for a publication
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.360]   that focused more on professionals
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.440]   and was at a little more sophisticated level
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.720]   that you could be at if you were writing
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.040]   for a more general audience.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.120]   So this was something that was sort of in my back of my head
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.040]   for a while.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.880]   And earlier this year, I decided that we
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.280]   wanted to go try and build it.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520]   We've been quoting stories from Jessicalesson.com all year.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.880]   You got Amirah Friday, who's another great by-line.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.080]   You've really been doing a good job.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.480]   How big is your team?
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.000]   How many people are you going to have working for?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.840]   We're five full time and eight in total and hiring.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.440]   So shoot me an email if anyone's interested.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.200]   Eight journalists?
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.040]   Not eight journalists.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.400]   Eight is our full team, which will include engineers and artists.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.640]   So we're basically five journalists.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.360]   Five journalists.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.320]   And I gather the idea is-- and this makes sense to me.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.200]   And I always said, we don't do a paywall.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.360]   We're advertising supported.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.720]   But-- and I always said that if you're going to have a paywall,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.160]   you've got to make money for people.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.080]   That the only reason people are going to pay for content
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.960]   is if they could see a direct benefit to them.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.640]   Absolutely.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.840]   That's actually the main thing we think about.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.120]   I mean, I think that you can't think about a paywall.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.800]   And is it a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.680]   Or what kind of paywall to use without thinking
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.400]   about the content behind it and what's
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.320]   that going to be worth to people?
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.920]   And so we're out there at $39 a month or $399 a year
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.440]   at a price point that's really geared
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.840]   towards people who are going to expect to learn a lot
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.240]   and get a business advantage from our content.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.720]   And I think that's the only way that we can justify that.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   And that's what we spend 100% of our time thinking about
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.640]   is how to deliver that kind of content.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.400]   But a lot of-- there's a lot of interest in paywalls
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   and business models in the media business.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.080]   But I don't think there's enough recognition
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.640]   that it really matters what's behind that paywall
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.360]   and who that's targeted at in terms of whether or not
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.000]   it will work.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.440]   So this is our bet that there's a nice audience fit
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.800]   at that price point with our content.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.040]   Yeah, Rupert Murdoch has famously tried paywalls.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   But there's a big difference between the Wall Street Journal,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.000]   which clearly makes money for its readers
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.680]   and for which I pay.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.360]   And something like the Daily Mail, which
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.560]   is no reason to pay for.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.600]   And so where he's done paywalls on just kind of general content,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.160]   it doesn't seem to have worked, I think.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.000]   Did you ever consider paywall for the technology?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.520]   Is it very?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.240]   No, really.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.680]   We did not.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.000]   I mean, partially because we were not
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.480]   aiming at business people.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.560]   We were running for consumers.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.600]   You recognized also that you got to have some--
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.920]   So our business model was a little bit of advertising,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.480]   although not exclusively advertising.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.640]   Because if you depend entirely on ad impressions,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.840]   you'll either kill yourself or you'll hate yourself.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.680]   We haven't done yet either, I promise.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.320]   So we did that.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.680]   So we did some sponsorships.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.280]   We created some content for other folks.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.440]   We did some events.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.600]   And we also stayed intentionally small.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.040]   I watch with interest because we always
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.760]   have to think about how we monetize.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.760]   We're pretty happy with our monetization strategy.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.280]   But I think there's plenty of room for--
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.280]   and it's great to see a bunch of experimentation,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.440]   a bunch of different ways of doing this.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.160]   Good luck, Jessica.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.840]   I think it's great.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.640]   Thank you.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.160]   Thanks very much.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.120]   Let's get to some of the top stories of the week.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.400]   Usually it's a little slow this time of year.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.440]   Thank God for Jeff Bezos, who keeps things interesting.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.160]   Right after the show last week, I went home.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.440]   I ran home because 60 minutes Jeff Bezos is on Charlie Rose.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.120]   And this is where I think there is a difference
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.720]   in mainstream media and tech media.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.080]   Charlie Rose says, Jeff is going to show us something
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.520]   no one else has seen.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.840]   And Jeff opens the door and Charlie goes,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.400]   I mean, really?
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.920]   And what it was, of course, and we've all
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.800]   talked about it for the past week, is delivery drones.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.200]   This is a very--
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.400]   even Bezos said a very beta idea.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.160]   And of course, the first thing everybody said is, oh, come on.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.360]   First thing that's going to happen,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.520]   somebody's dog gets chewed up by a drone dropping off a package.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.960]   It's going to be the end of that.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.080]   FAA approval, of course, the limitations.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.480]   But I was interested to see there.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480]   It is not brand new.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.680]   There is a company, for instance, that's
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.440]   been using drones or trying drones in Haiti
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.760]   for earthquake relief in Haiti.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.440]   That there are places without roads that a drone makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.680]   But this is-- so how much the question is,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.480]   how much of this was a media play,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.160]   and how much of this is serious?
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.480]   I actually think he's really serious.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.120]   Amazon's warehouses are a thing of technological beauty.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.880]   They are completely automated.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.320]   The picking process, which normally
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   takes an army of workers where they would go to different shelves
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.680]   and put together an order, that's all done by robotics.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.000]   So in his mind, I could see him saying, well, why don't we
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.560]   just extend that automatic process one step further?
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.960]   Rather than dropping it into the assembly area where
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.880]   it gets put into boxes, why not put it into a crate that
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.520]   gets automatically delivered to the customer?
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.440]   It has to be a certain object.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.000]   And it has to be--
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.240]   Under five pounds.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.080]   Yeah, and it has to be a nearby delivery.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.760]   Obviously, these drones can't go miles.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.320]   I think if that guy had come out the door,
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.560]   or the kid had come out the door 30 seconds earlier,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.800]   he would have been chopped into pieces.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.920]   So that's a problem.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.400]   It actually mititizes into the other Amazon news,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.880]   which is that the Supreme Court says
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.960]   that they won't hear Amazon make the case.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.240]   They don't need to charge sales taxes for other states.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.520]   How does that try to--
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.760]   Because once that's over, essentially, Amazon
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.840]   does never reason to avoid being in a lot of states.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.040]   Up until now, it's tried to be in as few states as possible.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.360]   So when I order stuff in California, it comes from--
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.920]   Comes from Vegas.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.800]   --it comes from Nevada.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.360]   If you have to charge sales tax,
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.800]   you might as well have more facilities.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.280]   Right.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.720]   You're not going to be able to do drones if you only
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.520]   have a few large warehouses far away from metropolitan areas.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.920]   They have 91 fulfillment centers.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.800]   I mean, Amazon is huge.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.360]   In fact, one of the reasons Amazon has historically not
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.520]   turned profits is they've decided--
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.800]   Since the dot-com bust had vested fulfillment centers
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.400]   and infrastructure, Bezos is a master.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.920]   I think it's really interesting to watch somebody
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.960]   build a business designed not to make any money for a long time.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.280]   I mean, he's really thinking long term.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.040]   So drones, if you think that long term, drones
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.280]   doesn't seem that crazy.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.920]   Well, I mean, everyone's making fun of it,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.800]   because of course you could poke fun at the individual scenario
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.240]   well, if you're further than 10 miles away, it won't work.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.320]   Well, if it's heavier than 5 pounds, it won't work.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.520]   Well, if the drone malfunctions,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.600]   it's going to fall on your car, et cetera.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.840]   That's a good problem.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.240]   But I mean, look back through the history of innovation.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.440]   There are so many things that people thought, well, that's
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.040]   stupid.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.120]   That's crazy.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.200]   That's ridiculous.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.920]   The technological hurdles are just amazing.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.880]   And they've become backbones.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.720]   I mean, the internet itself is one of those things.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.000]   So yes, does it sound crazy?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.720]   Yes.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.200]   Is it technologically impossible?
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.920]   No.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.440]   Right.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.240]   So I'd say if it's not technologically impossible,
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.680]   something like this is eventually going to take hold.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.800]   Now, whether or not it's Amazon or someone else who
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.840]   takes this idea and runs with it, that remains to be seen.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.000]   And presumably, delivery trucks hit people every day.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.320]   And--
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:19.820]   Right.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.320]   That's a good point.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.440]   You don't pay attention to it, because we've
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.160]   been used to that for decades and decades.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.280]   We're willing to put up with danger and problems.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.160]   Want to understand that stuff is valuable?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.240]   Jessica, you think Jeff Bezos is serious?
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.360]   Oh, I think he's very serious.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.640]   I do think he's underestimating the regulatory--
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.360]   he's probably not underestimating it,
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.200]   but he is a little non-sto--
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.920]   Downplaying it, yeah.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.440]   --on the regulatory issues that still remain.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.200]   I think he, in that 60-minute segment,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.680]   had some forecast for when the FAA is licensed or expected
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.760]   to approve some of the usage for commercial usage for drones.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.960]   And I think what I've read is less ambitious.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.880]   So I think they're dead serious.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.160]   I think it's certainly coming.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.640]   But like any other new category, Google Glass, et cetera,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.200]   I think we're going to have some battles play out in Washington.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.480]   And maybe Amazon will go ahead.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   And my big takeaway from this announcement
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.680]   was that they wanted to put some pressure on folks,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.640]   get a little bit of a buzz and pop before the holiday for Amazon.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   But put some pressure on Washington and the industry,
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.520]   because there are going to be a lot of battles
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   in the coming years over this.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.720]   It's interesting, because the consensus seems to be--
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.960]   and you guys all pretty sharp on this--
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.800]   that this wasn't a publicity stunt so much as really something
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.360]   he's serious about.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.200]   I think it's both a stunt and serious.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   I mean, the fact they're talking about it now, long, long, long
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.800]   before the netry do it is a stunt.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.840]   But that doesn't mean they don't really want to do it.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.480]   And it doesn't mean that it won't happen in some form
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.440]   from somebody within our lifetime.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.320]   This is a hacker's paradise though.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.440]   I mean, just the geek side of me is hoping to take over
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   and then throw--
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.520]   Please do this, because I'm going to order something,
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.680]   have it come to my house, shoot it down or capture it,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.160]   and figure out how it works and then reverse engineer it.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.440]   There is nothing really to keep you from catching the leg of the drone
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   before the years.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   It's got a landing of your house.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.440]   We've played with the quadcopters.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   They're really cool.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   I mean, I really like it.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.040]   And there's all sorts of uses for drones beyond delivery.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.440]   I mean, I think there's no question we're going to see.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.440]   Not just in law enforcement and military, but drones for all sorts
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.440]   of purposes.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   The idea of autonomous vehicles fascinating, frankly.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   I mean, this is as much of a PR stunt as the hyperloop was for Elon Musk.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   I mean, Elon didn't put a penny into that.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   He didn't put a penny in it.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.440]   He just said it.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   He just said it and people are running with it.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.440]   Maybe Bezos is hoping that people will do that with this technology.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   It looked like he had it.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   I actually think, Robert, I mean, I think it's much less of a stunt,
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   to be honest.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.440]   I mean, I think that the hyperloop is an idea in Elon's notebook.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   But I think these drones are coming.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   And Amazon is very, very serious about them.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   So I like the sentiment.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   But I think that there's a lot of discussion.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   Google is working on a lot of technology in this area as well.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   I would be shocked if there wasn't a major tech company that wasn't
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.440]   thinking about this as a platform.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.440]   So it's in my two cents.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.440]   But I think that this is going to be very serious technology.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   Well, Jessica, you would know this.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.440]   You've got your pulse on the inside of business.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.440]   Is there visionary envy among some of these big names that, you know,
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   they hate it when someone else comes up with that idea that inspires
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   people.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   They want to be the person that says, here's a crazy thing.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   Now make it work.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   Absolutely.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   And I also think it's visionary envy among the egos.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   But also among the companies, largely for recruiting purposes as well.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   I mean, I think that if you're an engineer and you see those videos,
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   Jeff Bezos and Amazon and drones, Amazon is a place you want to work.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   It's a place where cool stuff is going to happen.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   So there's a lot of brinkmanship in the look how cool I am these days.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   I think Google's sort of playing that card as well.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   They've got Google X, you know, their place for experimental moonshots.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   I think we'll talk a bit more about Andy and his robots.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   Later.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   So I feel that for sure in the industry right now.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   I love it visionary envy.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   I like it.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   That's the, that's the, uh, that's the wolfies these days is.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   I got a, I got the most visionary plan.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   Yeah, let's talk about Andy Rubin.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.440]   Andy Rubin, the head of the Android division until he left a few months ago.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   At the time I speculated I knew Rubin was really into robots.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   That's why Android is named a ro, a android.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   And, uh, and I think Larry, maybe with Sergey said he's going to be doing a
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   moonshot.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   Well, we now know what the moonshot is.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.440]   Jessica Lesson is here from the information.com.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   Father Robert Ballester of this weekend enterprise tech and the technologizer.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   Harry McCrackett from time.com.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Citrix, the makers of Go
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   to meeting.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   This is a time of year when meetings are hard and you know, uh, I bet you that
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   Jessica's staff isn't all in the same room.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440]   I know ours isn't.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   Uh, people travel, people get sick, but you still have to get together.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   You still have to share great ideas, do a little visionary thinking with your
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   coworkers.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.440]   And that's where meetings really do make a difference.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   But nowadays online meetings, uh, make it a lot easier and there's no easier way
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   to do an online meeting than go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   Go to meeting lets you share the same screen with your coworkers and clients
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   and colleagues online.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   Uh, not just from a computer, by the way, Mac or PC, but from mobile devices as
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.440]   well, you can even present from an iPad, which is pretty cool to be sitting out
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   in the, in the garden.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   Uh, if it's a nice day sitting in the jacuzzi, if it's a snowy day, uh, and, uh,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   working on the iPad and presenting to a client, I'm in the jacuzzi, would you?
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   Uh, let's talk.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.440]   You also get the HD faces.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   You may not want to turn that on in the hot tub, but the HD faces means you can
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.440]   see each other face to face in crystal clear HD video.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.440]   Just turn on your webcam and there you guys are.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   I just think it's fabulous.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   I know a lot of teams keep going and meeting running all day as a way to
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.440]   collaborate and remote locations.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440]   No credit card to get started.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   You could try it for 30 days.

[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.440]   Andy Rubin, I read stories about Andy, you go to his house.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   The robot answers the door.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   It's like the Jetsons.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   There's robots everywhere, so it wasn't much of a surprise when I read the article
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   in the Times about Andy Rubin.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   His next job at Google is designing robots.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   Robots for business more than for consumer.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   Not like an Android in your house butler.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   Supply chain and stuff.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   Supply chain, for instance, it writes John Markoff in the Times, "If Amazon can imagine delivering
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   books by drone, is it too much to think Google might be planning to one day have one of
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   its robots hop off an automated Google car and race to your doorstep delivering a package?"
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   It might be a little anthropomorphic, but I guess it's possible.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   Rubin's a smart guy.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   I wonder, though, is this-- Andy, I think, had done everything he could do at Android,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.440]   and it really was probably time for him to move on.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   Is this the case of, "Well, we just want to keep this guy inside the company, so give him
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.440]   something fun to do until we think of something better?"
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.440]   Or is this really serious?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.440]   Google is extremely serious about its moonshots, including ones that are far off.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   Rubin says it's a 10-year plan.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   And self-driving cars is more than 10 years, but there are several years into that, and
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440]   have made a lot of progress.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.440]   So the fact it sounds pie in the sky and unlikely to matter immediately doesn't mean that Google
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   is not dead serious about it.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.440]   Go ahead, Jessica.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Sorry.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.440]   Yeah, no, I totally agree.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   So at the information we reported the same day as the Times story, a very similar story
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   that talked about Andy and working on robots.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.440]   And we also hear that it's not just manufacturing.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.440]   So I think in the short term, yes, that's what they're focused on, but Andy has a lot
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   of ambitious ideas and has been thinking about what would it be like for humans to get used
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   to having assistance, and people essentially robots with them in their lives.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   So I think that's the scale he's thinking on.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   We know a little bit more about the project, but we know that it's being called Replicant,
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   which, of course, refers to the robots in Blade Runner, so keeping with his naming convention
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   of sticking to robots.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:02.440]   And he has a massive office complex in California Avenue in Palo Alto that has a ton of manufacturing
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.440]   equipment that he may open up to startups as well or to companies he's close to.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:13.440]   So there's a lot to watch in the project, but I think both we and the Times had reported
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   that Google's acquired a number of companies in this effort.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.440]   It is part of Google, so this isn't just Andy, although it often is just Andy when he has
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   this project going, but it's exciting.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   And he's pulled people from Android to work on it.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.440]   It's pretty hush-hush, but there's some real momentum building now.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:42.440]   And I think he's going to really try to get robots into the mainstream in a way that they
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   haven't been and we're probably many, many years away from, but he has a vision around
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   that and it's going to be fun to watch.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   I think Amir was Amir who said he was walking down California Avenue and looked up the
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   stairs at the office, and there's some sort of robot at the top of the stairs.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440]   Did he say that?
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   I think he was--
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   He may have.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   He may have.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   I know there are robots outside the Android building or some just sort of replicas of them,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   but Andy has a ton of robots.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   At Google, he had one that was trained as a coffee barista to make coffee.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.440]   So you even have to go to Starbucks.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440]   You need to call up Google.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.440]   Come on, let's go.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   It's part of his quirkiness and passion, and I think it's exciting for him to be at this
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.440]   phase.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   The one thing we do hear from folks who are close to the project is that everyone continues
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   to say how ambitious it is, and there's very much a sense of how are we going to do this,
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.440]   but that's often a good sign that you're onto something, I think, if you feel that way.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.440]   I wonder if Google has to be sensitive at all to the Skynet factor.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   The idea that maybe it's not such a good idea to build autonomous robots and everybody's
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.040]   a little afraid of Google anyway, and the last thing you want is Google to have autonomous
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   robots.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.440]   How sensitive, when you guys talk to people like Larry and Sergey, how sensitive are they
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.440]   to that, that the common person might be a little scared by this idea?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   I think they come.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   It's interesting because I was thinking about that in the follow on from Amazon.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.720]   Amazon announces this working on drones, and I didn't read a lot of concerns about privacy
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   and surveillance.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   I'm sure they were there, but that wasn't the knee-jerk reaction we had to that announcement.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.400]   If it had come from Google, I think it would have been the knee-jerk reaction.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.560]   I think that this gnaws at people at Google.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:51.400]   I think the company, Google is very aware that this is going to be a problem for them
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.280]   and in getting mainstream adoption of their technologies.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:00.920]   I'm not sure how much of a concern it is at the point of creating these projects and
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:07.040]   in terms of the engineers, how front and center it is, but clearly the company at large thinks
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.760]   a lot about it.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:18.320]   This was one of those examples where I think Google has to be thinking about these things
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.240]   and everyone's right to stress test on them, but we should be asking the same questions
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.760]   of Amazon and I haven't heard a lot of that.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.480]   You guys at theinformation.com also broke the news that Google is working on something
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.920]   for next year, they call Nexus TV.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.760]   Yeah, so that's kind of the- I can't read the article because I haven't paid for it,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.320]   but I will soon.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.120]   Can you just tell me a little bit about that?
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.200]   Sure, only if you promise to subscribe.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   I won't tell anybody.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   I'm fine.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   No, it's not easy.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   Wait a minute, let me ask you something because okay, I'm going to subscribe and then
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.360]   I'm going to read the article.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.640]   And how much of that, I mean, don't you worry that people like us will just say, "Hey, let
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.960]   me just tell you what the information said."
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.280]   It's a great question and our dear friends and business insider have a promise to put
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.560]   out all the news that they think is worthwhile out of our stories.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   That's nice.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.560]   You know what?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.960]   That's absolutely okay because we think the value proposition to our subscribers isn't
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   just the headlines.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.040]   It isn't just the facts that people are going to talk about and share on Twitter and elsewhere.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.160]   It's why they matter.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160]   It's the context.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.440]   It's the rest of the story.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.760]   It's getting that information first before everyone else, if that's valuable to you.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   It's just an ad for the information.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.880]   If I say, "Hey, the information had the story," that's just a pointer right back to you.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   Good.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   I think so.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.360]   And the reason I'm confident in that is that that was sort of what happened when I was
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.160]   at the journal for eight years.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.720]   We were also behind a paywall and when we had stories that warranted picking up by other
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.320]   outlets, they would pick it up, but it didn't cannibalize our core base.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.760]   And so that's the attitude we're taking.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:27:00.040]   About the story though, so we hear that Google is getting ready to as soon as sort of the
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.280]   first quarter of next year launch another one of these cheap set-top boxes, kind of
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   like the Apple TV, something that does not replace cable or TV but gets you Hulu and
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.360]   web video.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.800]   And in this case, also games.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.760]   I think having a gaming console in something that in some way can stand up against the
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.640]   Xbox and the PlayStation is what Google has in mind here.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:31.560]   Of course, Google, many, many years ago, focused primarily on Google as a beat reporter.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:37.120]   And I was writing about Google TV and a whole slew of products that were there attempts
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.000]   to get into the living room.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   This is another one.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.960]   We saw Chromecast earlier this year, which basically helps push stuff that's on your computer or
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.200]   tablet onto a bigger TV.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   You know, this category actually boggles me a little bit because I think we see so many
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.040]   you know, Roku's and Amazon's coming up with a box and Google.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.480]   And I just kind of wonder what it is about this around a $100 category that doesn't seem
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.880]   to be really taking off that has all these guys pushing forward.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:13.600]   And I think what it amounts to is that no one can afford to not get a toehold in the
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.480]   living room in terms of delivering advertising or delivering other kinds of content.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.760]   People are going to want to get it on their bigger screens.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.360]   And I think these companies feel like they have to have a presence there.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.800]   And they haven't been able to do big deals with the cable companies or the satellite companies
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.560]   or the other providers.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.600]   So they're going at it on their own.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.840]   I just don't know how many hundred dollar sort of little boxes we need to plug into our
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   screen.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.680]   So it's not a big selling category.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.120]   Apple TV, 13 million units, Roku, the next biggest, 8 million units.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.600]   That's 21 million total at a few more for Google TV.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.000]   I doubt they sold more than a dozen.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   So it's not.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.280]   And yet those of us who use them love them.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.200]   In fact, Harry Time magazine named the Chromecast the product of the year.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:06.680]   We like the Chromecast and both Roku and Apple have done well, but there have been dozens
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.400]   of products in this category that have completely failed.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   So it's really hard to do well.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   And it's not.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.560]   Well, maybe there's the consumers don't want it.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.920]   Maybe people just say, look, I got it's my TV.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.520]   The smart TVs do most of that.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.120]   I know lots of people in my family who have Roku's who are not gadget free.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.440]   So it is a category, but it may be enough to have sort of two healthy competitors rather
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   than more.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.600]   And not entirely sure what Google will do that will be wildly different from what's out
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   there on it.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.280]   I think that there, you know, it's interesting, Jessica, you said gaming because that makes
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.080]   me think of the Uya, which is a very inexpensive Android gamer.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.520]   You could bring it in at under 99.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.080]   In fact, you put Plex on the Uya, which you can do.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.680]   And it really is kind of everything that this would be.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.460]   But it's not compelling from a, you know, it's definitely does not compete against the
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.720]   PlayStation or the Xbox.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.280]   It's not a hardcore gamers box, in fact, on Wednesday on triangulation, I had Adam Sessler
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.400]   on we talked about gaming.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   And I asked him that.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.640]   He said, no, no, from a gamers point of view, the Uya is a non starter.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.560]   It's not that good.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.120]   And I can't imagine anything Google, I mean, sure it'll be an Android or a Chrome OS device.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.240]   It's not going to compete, I don't think.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.960]   You know, there's a there's a wisdom that we've had for a while that has said, look,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.520]   when you crack it, people will come.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.760]   So at the Apple TV, the Chrome, that's right.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.440]   So you need to have the right price point.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.520]   It has to be simple enough.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.840]   It has to work with what people have.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.200]   It has to have content.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.240]   We've seen products that actually have those things and we still have that boost of sales.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.400]   So I got to be saying, I got to be asking myself, it was that wisdom wrong?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.280]   Was it not if you crack it, they will come.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.040]   It's now people actually don't really want this, not that they want to get rid of it,
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.960]   but it's never going to be popular.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.080]   Those who want to watch content over the internet are going to do it on their computers
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.200]   or their computers connected to a screen.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.440]   Those people who just want to watch cable TV probably aren't going to want a crossover
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.440]   device.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.600]   And though all those products caught in the middle will sell a few million, but they're
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.160]   never going to become as ubiquitous as a tablet or a PC.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.400]   It strikes me that at least for some of the market, Microsoft's got it right, which is
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.080]   you make a powerful gaming machine, very, very expensive, 500 bucks, but it has media
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.400]   content capabilities.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.200]   That's actually something I welcomed into my living room because of the variety of things
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.360]   that I can play really good games on it.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.880]   And I can watch Netflix on it, I can watch Amazon streaming, and I can watch a Blu-ray
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   on it.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.760]   It's a good, to me, I mean, it's overpriced, they'll have to get the priced out, but it's
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   a good media device.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.320]   The consoles are the most successful TV streaming devices.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.080]   And at some point, I mean, every TV is going to have some sort of functionality built into
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   it.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.080]   And when that happens...
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   Well it does, I mean, my TV is...
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   Of all of the...
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   I mean, you can...
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.560]   I have met, I can watch Netflix in five different ways on any given set.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.960]   And that happens, it's not entirely clear what the $100 box does that your TV doesn't
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   do.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.400]   Having said that, we have a Roku, which we use every day, there is value there.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   For geek...
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.800]   Well, this is, I guess my point is that we're a bad sample.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   I mean, we're geeks.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.440]   And so we're gonna...
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.960]   Chromecast is great, I plug it in my HDMI, and it gets you from your WiFi, I can open
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.800]   up my Android device, and I can say YouTube, I can find it on YouTube, I can send it over
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   the Chromecast.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   But I wonder, I mean...
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.440]   Do you have any sales figures for the Chromecast?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.280]   I mean, why did you make it the product of the year?
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   Because over the last few years, I've reviewed a whole bunch of products that attempted to
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.200]   do exactly the same thing, bridging the gap between your computer and your TV.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.040]   Most of them have been like $150, $200, sometimes more.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.440]   They didn't work well.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.960]   They were clunky.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:43.360]   And the Chromecast is incredibly cheap, and it does it well on a straightforward way.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.080]   And yes, it's not for everybody in their grandma.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.600]   It is for people who have at least a tiny bit of geek in them.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.000]   35 bucks, though, does...
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.080]   And they're selling it in Walmart and Game
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   Mark.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.080]   And in fact, price range is kind of irresistible.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.920]   Yeah, it's an impulse purchase.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.320]   And it is essentially the opposite of Google TV.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:05.040]   Google TV was expensive and wildly ambitious and tried to do 2,000 different things and
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.600]   did not do well.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.160]   Chromecast does one thing, does it well, does it cheap?
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.400]   One thing that Xbox One does, that the Google TV did, I think it's unique in this category,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.600]   but I really like, is the idea of pass-through.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.680]   I put my cable or satellite box into the Xbox One and then the Xbox One into the television.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.480]   So it becomes an overlay over my TV viewing.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.320]   And that adds some interesting capabilities.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   They showed off at the announcement for the Xbox One, what is it, almost a year ago.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.760]   They showed you're watching a football game, but you've got your NFL.com snapped to the
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   screen.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.840]   You watch your fantasy football stats updated in real time while you're watching a real
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.840]   game.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   Things like that, I think, are pretty compelling.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.840]   And I liked it with Google TV, but it didn't sell anybody.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.320]   But I think Microsoft is actually on the right track with that.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.240]   That is one thing that none of the other boxes are doing, which is...
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.280]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.960]   Can I have a system that's just always there?
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.240]   I don't have to switch inputs.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.400]   I don't have to worry about what's connected to what.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.840]   I say, I wave at the Connect Sensor and suddenly it comes across a screen.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.720]   That's that idea of always on other screen functionality.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.120]   Maybe that's the secret sauce.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.640]   Maybe that's going to get copied.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.320]   Because, like, for example, it's yes, my TV and my DVD player and my receiver and my
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.040]   game console can all play Netflix.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.160]   But my parents never use those because they don't want to figure out what's on what input
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.160]   and they don't want to accidentally switch away from the cable box and they can't watch
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   TV anymore.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.880]   But if I tell them, look, to watch Netflix, just raise your hand and say Netflix and
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.280]   the menu comes up, it's absolutely not.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.320]   If that really worked well, if that really worked.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.200]   You don't even have to wave your hand.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.000]   When I come into the room, the Xbox One sees that Leo's here logs me in.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.160]   I could say Xbox, watch HBO, and it actually does do that.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   But it's still...
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.400]   It needs to be like 98% accurate and reliable.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.720]   Otherwise, it's too frustrating, I think, for normal people.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.280]   You end up yelling at the air.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.640]   I do think there's promise in this category.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.280]   I don't know if a Google Nexus is going to be any better than the Google TV was.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.320]   It's a challenge.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.440]   We come back with more Jessica Lesson from the information.com.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.520]   Harry McCracken from Time.com, the Technologizer.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.080]   I could still call you that, right?
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.720]   No, my content has that.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.400]   It feels like a superhero.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.840]   I am the Technologizer.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.120]   I'm here to polish up your chrome.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.760]   Whoa, gas.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.680]   Father Robert Palace there.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.240]   Do you still call yourself the digital jazz of it?
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.240]   Sometimes.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.400]   Okay, just checking.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.320]   From this week in Enterprise, tech Brian Chief from Twiad is also here.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   That's right.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.560]   Another one of my Twiad cosers.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.320]   Wearing the wildest hat I've ever seen.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.840]   That's a come up afterwards.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.560]   Yeah, we'll get him to show off the hat in just a little bit.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.280]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.280]   The holidays are here.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.240]   The last thing you want to do is fight off the amateurs at the post office.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.200]   You know, the people who only go to the post office once a year with the arm full of
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.800]   packages, a Christmas card list.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.560]   If you do bailing for a living, you know, you got to get the thing done.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.320]   And that's why I love Stamps.com.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   We use it here.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.000]   We actually have two accounts because we use it so much.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.320]   The idea is you can do everything you do at the post office from your desk using your
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   computer, your printer.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.400]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.920]   You don't need expensive postage meter ink.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.000]   You don't need to bring it to the weirdest thing is to buy a postage meter and then have
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.440]   to go to the post office to charge it up.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   That's nuts.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.920]   Stamps.com is all online.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   When the stamp rates go up, as they always do, it's automatically handled.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   You get a USB scale.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.960]   You could just plop a letter or package on.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.280]   You always have exactly the right postage.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.480]   No more guessing.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.880]   And Stamps.com kind of does all the grunt work for you.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.800]   It takes your return address, puts it on the envelope or the mailing label, takes the
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   address.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:58.720]   If you're selling on Etsy, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, it will take the address from the website.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.160]   You don't have to type it in so there's fewer mistakes.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   It's more accurate.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.800]   They'll even send out an email when you use Priority Mail or Priority Express Mail or
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.920]   send it out in the email to the recipient with a tracking number automatically.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.200]   It's like real hardcore fulfillment from your desk.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:18.040]   They even have a button at Stamps.com that will call the mail carrier to you.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.840]   This is the one thing the post office does so well.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.680]   Six days a week, somebody comes to your door, brings you stuff, takes stuff.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.600]   Take advantage of the stuff the post office does best while doing the stuff you need to
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.320]   do fast and easy.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.560]   You want to try it right now?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   Visit Stamps.com.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.320]   Go up to the top of the page there and click that old-fashioned radio microphone on the
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.080]   right and enter the offer code TWIT.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.000]   We're going to take that offer and spell it right.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.880]   TWIT is spelled T-W-I-T and you're going to get $110 value, $55 in free postage to use
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.160]   over the first few months at Stamps.com.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.520]   The digital scale is yours.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.600]   You just pay shipping and handling on these five bucks.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.840]   And by the way, that's yours to keep canceling anytime.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   Just keep the scale.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:06.120]   $5 supply kit and of course a four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.840]   I love it because I can actually get stamps from Stamps.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   Did you know this?
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.240]   Well, I come in and they print out stamps on little stickies and I don't have to lick
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   it or anything.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.760]   I heard that Stamps.com is actually going to be using quadcopters to pick up your mail.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.920]   They're not working on that technology.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.480]   Wouldn't that be awesome.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.960]   I used to have stamps from Stamps.com that had my picture.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   Talk about narcissistic.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.760]   They had my picture on it.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   I don't know.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   I never used them.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   I was embarrassed to use them.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.360]   They're like, I can't do this.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.400]   This is crazy, crazy.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.840]   Looks like it's a deal.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   It's a done deal.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.960]   Microsoft and Nokia get the approval of both the US and Finnish governments and the EU
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.920]   or the EC as well.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:55.320]   So come early next year, Nokia, the former Finnish tire company that got into cell phones,
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:02.120]   will be part of Microsoft and Stephen Eelop, the CEO of Nokia, will be inside Microsoft
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.840]   once again, making him a front runner for CEO.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.120]   Let's talk about the CEO because there's never been a list released from Microsoft,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.840]   but it seems like we all know who the candidates are.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.240]   Jessica, you might have the inside story on that.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   You know who's going to be.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.960]   No, I can't guess at this point and we're not hearing anything in particular about the
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   handicapping.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:34.120]   I mean, there was a lot of excitement about Alan Mulally from Ford and then I think-
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.120]   He's kind of denied it.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.120]   He was on CNBC.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   Sort of, but not really.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   Exactly.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   He was a nod to my other hand.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.240]   He's sort of denied it and now he's sort of renewed his contract through next year.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.560]   So I think it's hard to say.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:53.480]   The only concrete thing I hear is that, and I think all things D reported this as well,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:40:00.040]   that the sort of Silicon Valley insiders are all lobbying for Tony Bates who obviously
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.400]   ran Skype and came into Microsoft through that.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:09.320]   So all I can say about the poor right now is I think that there's some attention still
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.600]   to sort of inside candidates.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.880]   But it feels like to a lot of people that the board is going to continue to look outside.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.960]   And I also don't think anything's imminent for this year.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.520]   I think that while the board had maybe been hoping that was a case, I heard recently that
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.480]   there were some new interviews and new people going through the process that made that seem
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   unlikely.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   You know what?
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   They're not.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   They're having a really hard time.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.760]   John Thompson, who's leading the search, he's on the Microsoft board former executive
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.160]   at IBM and an African American who would.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.040]   I think in many people's minds, being an excellent CEO can and has recused himself.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.480]   He says, "No, I don't want to run."
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.360]   Of course, Dick Cheney did the same thing.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.920]   I think that Tony Bates makes a lot of sense, except he's only recently been a part of Microsoft.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.480]   And Mary Jo Foley pointed this out from all about Microsoft.com and our Windows Weekly
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.120]   show, we were talking about this with mail at Mary John Paul Thoreau, that Microsoft probably
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.520]   needs somebody who's pretty familiar with Microsoft's business.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.280]   It is a hairball.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.320]   There's a lot of divisions, a lot of different businesses.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.360]   It's devices, it's services, it's operating systems, it's gaming systems, it's online.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.640]   It's a big deal.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.960]   And if you come from the outside, you're going to spend the first, who knows, year trying
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.880]   to figure out where all the bodies are buried.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.000]   There's a lot of talk.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.640]   And I was actually just listening to a program about a week ago talking about the CEO search
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.880]   and how the buzz phrase was, "Well, we need the anti-bomber."
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   And I don't know if that's true.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.560]   And I don't think that's true.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.600]   I think, yeah, we're going to malign bomber.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   He made a lot of mistakes.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.000]   But he wasn't a horrible CEO.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.080]   He didn't drive the company to the ground.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.480]   And he actually was involved with all the different divisions of Microsoft.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.680]   The value of Microsoft from the day he started to his retirement was gone up considerably,
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   right?
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.080]   Yeah, I don't think bomber messed up Microsoft.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.400]   And I think that odds are pretty good that no matter who was CEO of Microsoft over the
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.240]   last decade, they would not have monopolized cell phones or tablets the way they monopolized
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.560]   the PC, just because almost never does the company that dominates the old world, dominate
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   the new one as well.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   Right.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.400]   And, you know, bomber did make mistakes.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.200]   But I think if you think that he was terrible and is to blame for Microsoft not being at
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.600]   the center of the technology world anymore, you were setting a bar for him that almost
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.040]   nobody could have not.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.680]   Steve Jobs is the one person who did meet that bar.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.040]   Well, I think a younger Alan Malali, Malali 68, I don't think he just wants to retire
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.400]   after what little while.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.640]   He's a great CEO at Ford.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   He turned Ford around.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   He did.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.480]   I mean, and he's a really great guy, a very impressive guy.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.360]   I do find it odd that he has not said I will not serve as Microsoft CEO.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.240]   Please don't ask me to do that.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.320]   He wouldn't serve for long.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.880]   I mean, one of the speculations is that you get a guy like Malali in for a couple of
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.160]   years while a Tony Bates or somebody like him.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.600]   Nadal gets a little up to speed as a CEO and then make a transition.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.080]   Oh, the bomber said he was leaving though because the transition needed somebody who
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.760]   would be with that for the long term.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.720]   So if they do hire somebody who's not there for the long term and doesn't plan to be there
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:30.320]   for the long term, that does not jive with the rationale for why Steve Ballmer is stepping
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   down.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.600]   I think that tied up in this question is what is Microsoft in terms of what businesses will
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   stay or go.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.840]   I mean, there's been lots of discussion of whether online services or Xbox should be
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   separate businesses.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.160]   I mean, should it all be this one Goliath?
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:55.360]   And I imagine those questions will fall largely on this person and they're very much alive
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   now.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.400]   So I think that complicates the CEO choice, but very much still in the background in terms
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.080]   of what this business looks like and what is the focal point of Microsoft?
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.680]   Is it still Windows?
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   Is it Office?
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   Is it Xbox?
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   Those are the questions.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:17.000]   Well, I want to see if that whole the revamping of the philosophy to go towards devices is
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.840]   going to survive the change in CEO because it actually sounded like a decent change in
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.480]   where we're leading the company.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.800]   If we're moving away from the siloed version of Microsoft where office is competing against
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.840]   server, competing against mobile, competing against entertainment and now looking at just
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.600]   having users that are in the Microsoft environment, I am actually very attracted to that.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.720]   If the new CEO is going to say, no, it was better the old way where this division fought
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.400]   that division that for resources.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.640]   I don't want to see that.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   Clearly dysfunctional.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.800]   That's wholly dysfunctional.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.600]   You know, E-Lop for a while, the thought was E-Lop comes in and does do the split.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.160]   E-Lop said, I think he said he wanted to sell off Bing and Xbox.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.160]   That's the story, yeah.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.720]   Which is the wrong kind of thing.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.320]   I think if he asked me the wrong thing to do, and not even doable, Bing is so intertwined
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.400]   with what Microsoft's up to that I don't think you can even do that.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.680]   Such a Nadella who's their cloud guy is a good candidate inside.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   I don't know.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   I don't know.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   I think this is tough.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   I don't.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.600]   Is there, you think there's a Marissa Meyer out there?
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:31.400]   It's kind of a somebody nobody expected that could be hailed as a conquering hero as somebody
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.640]   who could come in and turn the thing around.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   Who would it be?
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.400]   There's only one person I could think of.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   Tony Stark.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   Chuck Norris.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.400]   Go ahead, Jessica.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:47.560]   No, I was just saying, I'm sure the answer is yes, but it doesn't seem like that's totally
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.560]   the direction that the search is going largely because of what I think what you identified.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:59.800]   This is such a complicated company that you're really, is it fair to throw someone in that
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.080]   who doesn't know some of the nuances?
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:10.040]   Yahoo at the end of the day, I think, has straightforward problems, straightforward opportunities.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.600]   It's quite different, but I don't think we'll have a big surprise on this one.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   Really?
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.000]   No, no, because I think Marissa was kind of a surprise, wasn't she?
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Definitely.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.320]   There's nobody out there who is famed for being an expert at consumer and famed for being
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.920]   an expert at enterprise stuff.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   Right.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   That's unique.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.760]   And to be the greatest possible Microsoft CEO, you need to be really good at both of those
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   things.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.080]   And it will probably be somebody who is really good at one of them and learns how to do the
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.920]   other one.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:47.280]   You do as you did see though that interesting enough, Bill Gates has a back tattoo of Steve,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.720]   says RIP Steve Jobs 20.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.800]   No wait a minute, that's South Park.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   How did we miss that?
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.640]   Just glanced over at your screen this week's South Park.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:06.600]   Apparently Bill Gates gets in a battle, a death match with the CEO of Sony and all is
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   revealed.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.080]   He's got quite a tap.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.240]   I put my money on Bill Gates.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240]   He's wiry.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   Look at him.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   He's wily too.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.480]   And he can jump over a chair.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   He can.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.560]   I go ahead and do that.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.840]   Jessica, you'll get the idea that we're just not very serious here.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.000]   Nice to have a serious journal.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   We have a comic.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   So we're trying to do.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   You have a comic?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   We do.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.320]   Our first one is out.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.480]   The comic is free.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.880]   So I'm subscribing right now.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.400]   No, don't say the comic is free.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.000]   No, that's what I'm paying for.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Is it a comic?
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.080]   Okay, there are more comics that aren't free.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.240]   You could take your articles.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.080]   I want a comic.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.320]   Who's the comic?
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.960]   Believe it or not, it's my brothers.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:54.560]   My brother is a very accomplished artist and video producer.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.400]   And so he's doing a series for us.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:02.680]   The first ones online, sort of poking fun at folks who are so obsessed with seeing that
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.240]   when their Uber will arrive that they've missed the fact there are tons of free cabs
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:11.560]   in front of them, which is something I confess I've been guilty of.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:18.680]   So we're going to continue in that vein, some gentle poking at us techies and how we
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.480]   live our lives.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.800]   They're fun to do.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   And I love them.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.440]   And I've seen so many great ones, particularly online lately, that we thought we had to weigh
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440]   in.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.720]   Oh, where can I see?
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.560]   You said it's online for free.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   Where can I see the first one?
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.320]   Oh, it's at the information.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.400]   If you scroll down, you probably have to scroll down based to the bottom.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.840]   What's called "Decoded" is the slug for it.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   I see it.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   Matt Vaskel, Vaskerelo.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.760]   Oh, your brother's got skills.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   Vaskelero.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.760]   Vaskelero.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   That's your brother.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.520]   He studied semiotics at Brown University.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   Smart man.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.080]   That's awesome.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.680]   And he lives in LA where he writes and directs.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   And where's the...
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   Right.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680]   So that is the comic.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.680]   That's the comic.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.680]   Oh, there it is.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.680]   Your Uber roller.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   I love that.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.760]   I love that.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.360]   I tried Uber for the first time last night.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.520]   Uber's awesome.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.840]   It was actually interesting.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.240]   I'm not getting in a yellow car anymore.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:23.720]   I went all my cars to either have a pink mustache or what does this respect yourself,
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.720]   GNC?
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   I love this.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.720]   This is awesome.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:34.120]   Let's take a break and come back with the brother of cartoonist Vaskelero.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.680]   How do you say that?
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.680]   Vaskelero.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.680]   Vaskelero.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.320]   Jessica Lesson.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.560]   And Robert Balaser.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.000]   Coding 101 betas are win.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.720]   Coding 101, we just did one this Friday.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.200]   We do one in two weeks.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   Are you going to put that up on Insight to it?
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.760]   It's going to go up on Insight to it.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.400]   So youtube.com/ Insight to it.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   Correct.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   Correct.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.160]   And then starting in the new year when we bring in the brand new schedule along with that
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.840]   schedule comes Coding 101 on Thursdays.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   Awesome.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   Awesome.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   Awesome.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.200]   And Harry McCrackett from the Technologizer Time magazine.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:15.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you missed anything this week on Twitch here in a short, boiled
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:21.520]   down promo is everything you wanted to see.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.360]   Previously on Twitch.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.760]   Tech news today.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.320]   Jeff Bezos unveiled Amazon Prime Air.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   The first time you get a pizza by drone, you're going to be fired up.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.800]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:39.680]   The United States Army was caught pirating about $180 million in software.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   Triangulation.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.600]   The floor director at the time, I can't remember who it was, goes, um, they would like you
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   to River Dance.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.760]   I might hear if I can't show you.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   Come on.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   Let's see.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   I want to see some River Dance.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   It went like this.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.240]   This is how you get a job.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   And I got the job.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   Windows Weekly.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   Now look at this.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.640]   This is a YouTube video of a guy swearing at his connect.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.520]   He gives him a technical foul as you get leaking.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.080]   I think that's awesome.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.080]   iPad today.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.560]   This is one of the things I really like about Google as opposed to Siri.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:14.080]   With Google, it actually types as you are talking, which is pretty cool.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   And you know what?
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   The answer you've found?
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   Symptoms of a stroke.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   Twitch.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.080]   Friends don't let friends miss Twitch.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   Hey, I didn't know that you guys were dancing behind me.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:29.040]   I'm putting my microphone on.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.440]   And you guys are dancing behind me.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.440]   That's what we do.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.640]   And nobody goes dancing.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.240]   No, I just go.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.440]   You look right.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.240]   All right.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   Hey, Tom merits here.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.640]   Let's take a look at what is on the week ahead.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.840]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.640]   Here's a couple things coming up in the week ahead.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.560]   Not much as things slow down for the holidays, but Tuesday, December 10th.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.120]   Mozilla's Firefox Metro for Windows 8 is supposed to arrive.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:02.160]   So the Oppo N1 goes on sale, $599 or 449 euros.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:07.480]   And Saturday, December 14th, ingress, Google's augmented reality game will be open to all
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   Android users.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   I was addicted to that game.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   That's a brief look at the week ahead.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   You and Chad got me into it.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.480]   Thank you, Tom.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   You and Chad got me into ingress.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.520]   In fact, Chad sent me a beta, but it involved too much walking.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.120]   No, that's I love that.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.480]   I don't want a video game that makes me walk around.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.920]   I want one that I can go like this and sit and play.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   So the idea is, and it's not good in Petaluma.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   That's the other one.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   No, you need some place with density.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.000]   So the idea is they take public buildings and location information and you go and you're
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.720]   supposed to hack the building.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.800]   It's like capture the flag, but in real life.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.560]   And are you resistance or?
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   I am resistance.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   What's the other one?
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   Enlightened.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   Enlightened.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.560]   I'm resistance too.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.520]   Just two days ago, I was walking around the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco at four in
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   the morning.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.080]   See, this is why it's a problem.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.080]   It's the addiction.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.960]   Somebody told me it's best on bicycle because you can get around.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.520]   I have seen two people ingressing on bicycle slam into poles.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.280]   So please walk.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.160]   Also I'm surprised nobody's been arrested as a terrorist because what you do is you go
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:13.760]   up in front of government buildings with your phone and you start listening, it's talking
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.080]   and it says things like, it says scary things like place of the hack.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.040]   I got talked to by the Park Service.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   You did.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.040]   I got to go to Washington DC.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.320]   We had this major event.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.120]   One of the portals was the White House, but you could only get to it by putting your hand
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.960]   through the gate to get the GPS close enough to the building.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.240]   So you had dozens of people doing this and if they didn't turn the volume off on their
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.120]   phone, it was saying target locked.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   And so you got people.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   Target locked.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   You're leaving through the gate of the White House.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   Right.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.800]   It locked is not what you wanted to say.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   Not smart.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.040]   SDC in our chair room says twice he's been accosted by police playing angry.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:51.000]   So please now that it's public, be a little careful.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Play an ingress.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   It's interesting.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Why is Google?
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Why did Google do this?
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.240]   You know how it's a game, but it gets them so much data from people's GPS devices about
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.840]   the maps, about where people are congregating.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:09.240]   They can actually figure out movement patterns of people and where they go and people think
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.760]   it's just a game for Google.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   That's actually big data.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.760]   It's a great idea.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:20.000]   Speaking of big data, Apple has purchased Topsy for two, we think $200 million, although
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.960]   some rumors that maybe it's a little bit more, a lot more than $200 million.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:30.520]   Topsy was a data analytic company, Topsy Labs, that launched right about the same time
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.240]   as Twitter and they have every tweet ever published.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.080]   They have what's called the fire hose of data.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.200]   Yeah, they do a better job of letting you search Twitter than Twitter does of letting
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.320]   you search Twitter.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.200]   Why would Apple want Topsy Labs?
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:54.400]   I think it was not just about social data because I think that Apple, frankly, doesn't
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   have a...
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.160]   Well, it's not their business.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:03.080]   It's not their business and it's not that it isn't important, but Apple thinks about
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.680]   software and how we can sell more devices.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.640]   I don't just think it's for the raw data.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:15.520]   I think it's for the talent and the engineers and the expertise in thinking about software
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.960]   that goes beyond software today.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:26.280]   Apple has this, I think, a strategic challenge in that for many years iTunes was the killer
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:33.080]   software that you needed and that got you to buy and I pod and then eventually an iPhone.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:38.720]   And Apple's been investing as iCloud is another one of those killer software platforms that
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.400]   you just lock into and that has an intense amount of loyalty so that keeps you in the
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   Apple ecosystem.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.520]   It doesn't work very well.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:51.760]   But it doesn't work very well exactly and I think Apple doesn't have...
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:56.480]   To Apple, software and services are important in terms of engendering loyalty, the hardware
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:03.160]   and it needs new expertise in that area and I think the team at Topsy is looking to them
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.840]   to help chart the next course.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:11.760]   It's puzzling to me because it isn't in Apple's wheelhouse in any way or even in their core
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   business in any way.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.360]   And you just have to look at ping.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   But it is.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   But it really is.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.720]   There is a golden cow here in social networking.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.800]   Well, I understand it's a good business but it's not Apple's.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.160]   No, not the social networking business itself because most of the tools for social networking
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:33.520]   have been decent at taking the fire hose of data off of Twitter, off of Facebook and
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.480]   figuring out trends and influencers.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.360]   One thing that Topsy was trying to do and I think Apple, that's the reason why they
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.560]   bought them is they were trying to get proactive.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.080]   They were trying to tell you, you want to get your products in this person's hand.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:50.240]   You want to get your event in this city because this is where we're seeing a chain reaction
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.240]   of social engagement.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.200]   That's absolutely an Apple's business.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   That's how they sell their products.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.560]   So you're saying they're going to take it private in effect, making it in house and use
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.840]   it for their retail business?
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.360]   This is their internal engine that says, "Oh, that's interesting."
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.440]   This person needs to be using a MacBook.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.120]   That person needs to be using an iPad.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.360]   This person needs our new wearable tech because they're going to influence everybody else.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:14.800]   That makes sense actually because it's clear retail is a big part of Apple's financial
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   success.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.920]   I mean, the fact is not an Apple's wheelhouse.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   It's probably a good reason for them to be acquiring companies like this.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.400]   A lot of it comes back to big data.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.560]   We know that that has never been a strength of Apple's examples such as Apple Maps or
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.560]   everywhere.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:35.280]   It therefore makes sense for them to acquire people who are good at that.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:39.080]   It may not have that much to do with searching Twitter.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:43.640]   The Topsypokes folks have proven they're really good at analyzing vast quantities of
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.280]   data and making sense of that.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.440]   They just send them an analysis, I think, which is very tricky.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.360]   You're not merely saying there were 38 tweets about the Apple store.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:56.200]   You're saying of the 3,800 tweets about the Apple store, 53% were happy.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.560]   That's the same reason.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.280]   I think it's unlikely that Microsoft will end up selling Bing because Microsoft also
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.680]   needs to be able to understand vast amounts of data and the closest thing they have to
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.720]   a team focused on that is the search people.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.960]   They're going to need that for Windows Phone.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.160]   They'll need that for Windows 8.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.000]   They'll need that for enterprise stuff, too.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.400]   People are the one company that's already good at that.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.480]   I think there's also a--to get to the merchandising potential of the data.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.960]   I think it's less in terms of retail because Twitter signals or social media signals are
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   probably only one signal for whether you're going to buy a $2,000 computer.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:37.160]   But also if you think of the iTunes and the App Store and solving discovery problems like
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:43.520]   how do I find new apps and how does that keep me engaged in my device?
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.680]   Apple bought a search engine called Chomp a while ago for a lot less.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.480]   It was about recommendations though, app recommendations, right?
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.480]   It was.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:59:00.280]   The motivation and people who were on that team have taken on broader data science recommendation
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:05.840]   roles within eddy-cues organization within iTunes.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.600]   I'm not 100% sure if that's the case with Topsy, but I think it reminds me a little
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.760]   bit of that and that expertise.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:19.720]   I think that we sometimes forget, I mean, while Apple does sell devices, the App Store
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:25.120]   has become just this ginormous ecosystem and people complain about app fatigue and how
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:30.360]   do you get people to continue to buy new apps and also music and video and all the other
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   media within iTunes.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.360]   I can see Topsy playing a big role there too.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.520]   I guess Apple's got cash to burn.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.520]   It seems like they could have just hired Topsy.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.120]   They didn't have to buy Topsy.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.160]   They could have just--I mean, that's what Topsy's business was.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   I mean, that's one of their core concepts.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   So if that's going to be a core thing or maybe keep others from using it, if it's a good
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.040]   technology and Apple's retail could use it or Apple's recommendation engines could use
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.760]   it, keep it out of the ecosystem so the others can't.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.240]   Of course, $200 million is the change in Apple's snack challenge.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   It's nothing.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.520]   So what's the interest on $150 billion in cash?
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.240]   It's got to be more than that a day, right?
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   A lot.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   It's a day's income.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   It's nothing.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240]   It's nothing.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.280]   It's like if I went out and buy it, it's been a buck 50 and a Starbucks.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   It's just--it's nothing.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   This is Apple's version of an impulse buy.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   Oh, I got to have that.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   Oh, it's changing.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   Oh, it's changing.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   Oh, give.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.600]   You could pay them $1,000 a month or you could just buy them for $200 million.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.040]   I'll take it.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.040]   It's a deal.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.640]   We'll amortize that in 100 years.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.240]   I do want to talk more about Apple retail and about Ibekin because all of a sudden it's
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.440]   like the world discovered Ibekin.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.240]   Robert Scobel's been on the show many times going crazy about Ibekin.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.680]   The problem is when Robert Scobel goes crazy about something, I usually go, "Okay, but
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.480]   really I should have paid attention because this is very interesting."
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:56.480]   There's a reason why Ibekin is suddenly going to be a big deal.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.680]   We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680]   I'll show today.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.520]   I brought to you by our friends at Squarespace.com.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.200]   It's web hosting, yes, but it's also the best content management system and the web hosting
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.200]   together.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.360]   By making the two things interact like this, you get the best web hosting and the best content
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.480]   management system.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.960]   A Squarespace site never go down, for instance, and we got a lot of traffic on our blog site
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   this week inside.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.040]   That's with that TV.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.200]   At no point was it unavailable because Squarespace, when there's more traffic to your blog, they
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.040]   put more bandwidth on it and it's automatic, it's instantaneous.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.800]   You'll never even notice the difference.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.880]   The content management system, it's so good, it's so elegant, it's so modern, it's always
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   up to date.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.920]   You never have to worry about security or updates because it's automatically up to date.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.600]   I want you to try it.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.160]   If you're interested and perhaps you want to, maybe you're looking for better hosting or
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.800]   you want to start a new site, maybe you want to do e-commerce Squarespace has that too.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.760]   Visit squarespace.com, click the get started button and all you need to do, you don't need
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.640]   to give them a credit card or anything, is just pick a template.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.800]   You start with 20 gorgeous templates, all of them mobile responsive.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.080]   By the way, there's momentum, I like that one.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.280]   That's a full bleed, that means the picture goes all the way to the edge of the screen.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.120]   You might say, "Yeah, but what about what size screen?"
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.360]   It's a matter because even if it's a 27 inch screen or a 4 inch screen, Squarespace sites
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.440]   adjust automatically to fit the screen.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.840]   Your site always looks great.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.960]   There's no separate mobile site, it's all there.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.960]   Even the e-commerce is mobile enabled.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.880]   That's really special.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.640]   That's a pretty looking dog bear.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   Pick your template, but scroll down, you'll see all the different things done with the
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   same template.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.280]   That's another thing I like about Squarespace.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.120]   You don't have to be a designer and have a great looking site.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.600]   You don't even have to know CSS or JavaScript or any of that stuff.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.040]   It's all drag and drop point and click.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.480]   You add the social media, add whatever you need.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.880]   If you are a developer, they have a developer platform, that's very, very nice, but you
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.880]   don't need to be and that's the point.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.360]   Every site looks unique.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.760]   You want a little help, they've got the best customer service in the business.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.240]   They've got webinars online that you can take.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.640]   They've got a great active user base and forums too.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.160]   There's always plenty of places to turn for help with your Squarespace site if you should
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   need it.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.480]   SEO automatic, it's all taken care of.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.760]   All the things that Google or Bing or whoever you need are done, things like site maps done
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.360]   for you automatically.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.280]   I am just a big fan now.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.600]   If you try it for two weeks, and by the way, you can import all your existing content into
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.920]   it, if you try it for two weeks and you say, "Yeah, I kind of like this," check out the
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.920]   pricing.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.920]   It's as little as $8 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.480]   Most people go for that unlimited plan of $16 a month.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.280]   That means you could do something like the information because you could have unlimited
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.560]   galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited pages, unlimited contributors, total control over
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.880]   who has admin access, who has publish access, all that stuff, unlimited bandwidth.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.480]   You suddenly go big, you get slashed out of it or twitted or dug or whatever, and you're
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.600]   never going to get a bandwidth bill, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.080]   When you register for a year, you get a custom domain and they hook it all up for you free.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.120]   $16 a month, want to do e-commerce.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.960]   They do that to $24 a month.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.080]   They do not take a transaction fee.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.080]   That's it.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.440]   $24 a month.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.720]   You get unlimited physical, unlimited digital, unlimited service products.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.840]   You can have unlimited, unlimited's the word, right?
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.720]   Pages, storage, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited contributors.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.760]   They will help you track inventory, do taxes.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   That's not trivial.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.280]   I mean, all over the country, different taxes, even in different cities, they do that all
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   for you.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.000]   They will help you with shipping, complete coupon controls.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.200]   That's $24 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.160]   We're going to make it even more affordable because when you use our offer code, TWIT12,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:45.120]   you will get 10% off your new account at squarespace.com.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.760]   The free two week trial, you don't need our offer code, squarespace.com.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.600]   When you decide to buy, use Twitch12 for 10% off.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.720]   When you get the annual plan and it starts to add up some real savings, very impressive
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   site.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.760]   See, you should have done that with the information.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:05.200]   I bet you you're spending more than $12 a month on your site, Jessica.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.720]   It's not cheap.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.120]   Little more.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   We just agreed to redesign our TWIT.tv site, which we redesigned a year ago because it's
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.200]   just so dysfunctional.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.680]   It's expensive.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.680]   It's hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680]   To do it right.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.520]   We're not even doing something as elaborate as you're doing, Jessica.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:31.480]   Boy, when you look at $24 a month, it just sounds like such a deal.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.880]   You might say, "Well, why don't you do squarespace?
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.080]   We do for our blog, but I think for the podcast, for all the stuff that we do, we're using
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.440]   Drupal and we need that more powerful."
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.560]   What are you using for your back end on the information, Jessica?
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.800]   We've built a custom solution, actually.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.360]   It's based on Ruby or it's Ruby.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.280]   On Rails or?
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.280]   Yes.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:57.000]   Great.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.920]   There are a lot of great things out there, but we have a lot to our platform, including
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.960]   a lot around newsletters, which is a big part of the offering and a lot around subscriber
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.200]   management.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.840]   We built it from scratch.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.800]   When you left the journal said, "I'm going to do the information in your mind," obviously
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.280]   to say it out loud.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   Is that right?
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.000]   I didn't say the name out loud, but all my editors and teams and friends at the journal
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.840]   knew exactly what I was going to do.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:33.760]   I was interested in their views and opinions very much.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.360]   It took what, six months to do the site or how long did it take?
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.960]   From the day I left the journal until launch last week was about almost six months to the
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.600]   day.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.560]   We wanted to get out there when you've got a bunch of reporters who love the news and
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.200]   want to write stuff that you can't really vanish for a year and hold on to your stories.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.000]   They don't last that long.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   No.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.760]   Yeah, everybody's champing at the bit.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.360]   I'm sure and I'm sure the developers are going, "Pupesh, I should be patient.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.400]   I'm writing as fast as I can."
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.040]   It's very, you know what I like about it?
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.240]   I haven't paid for it, as you know.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.480]   I'm still, but I'm just going to the front page.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.520]   It's very clean and very straightforward.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.320]   Yeah, that's our goal.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.440]   We're big believers in the importance of technology and have a lot of ideas around new features
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.720]   and products and ways to improve it.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.360]   But at the end of the day, our value proposition is the stories and the content.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.200]   We wanted to put most of our effort there.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.000]   Of course, we don't have advertising and we don't care about tricking people to stay
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.880]   on the site longer or to click a lot of headlines.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.120]   That left up a lot of room in the design.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   That's a really good point.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.680]   I think it is something that has become a bit of a problem reading technology news is linkbait.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.760]   What do they call the lists, the little lists of people who are?
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   The listicles.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.320]   It drives me baddie.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:00.120]   Of course, all I do day in, day out is comb through tech meme.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   I use prismatic, which is Brad Cross's kind of social media triggered news studies, Feedly.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.080]   I use all these tools, Nuzzled, Jonathan Abrams, Nuzzled.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   I look at, and of course, my own feeds, and I look at tons of stuff, and 90% of it is
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.080]   crap.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   It's really depressing.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080]   I also think --
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   I've spent some money.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.080]   Not to chime in.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   Leo, maybe before the hour is up, we can't --
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   You got me.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080]   I'm sold.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   [laughter]
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   It takes 20 seconds.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.720]   But do not have to do linkbait just by itself must be freeing.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   I think the other thing that you hit on that I hear a lot and felt a lot is not only is
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.160]   there variety and the quality of the content, but I think there's a lot of the same thing
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   every day.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.880]   And because everyone's so focused on whether it's Amazon drones or sort of weighing in on
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:00.920]   these topics that are known to generate a lot of traffic, what you have is a sort of,
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.320]   you know, in any given day, we're sort of consolidating coverage around these attention
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.320]   grabbing topics.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.320]   And I think that there are many reporters out there, and there's so much going on in the
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   industry, you know, why is that true?
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.000]   Why are we just all running to the same place on the field?
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.840]   And I think a lot of the reason is because of the economics of the business models that
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.960]   are dependent on advertising and capturing sort of what there's buzz around.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.440]   And we think differently, and one of the things that we hope to do is, you know, introduce
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.480]   some new points into the daily conversation around tech.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.680]   So we're not all just talking about the one or two things that happen that day.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.880]   Speaking of somebody who will be rehashing your content regularly, thank you.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.000]   I actually we want to we really want to we just hired Mike Elgin as many of you know,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.680]   we really want to beef up our news coverage and and even if we could maybe break some
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680]   stories.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.040]   I mean, what we do is pun pun to tree, but I think you're absolutely right.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.920]   You can't just be corn beef hash all day.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.160]   Occasionally you need a steak hash.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.680]   I do like corn beef hash.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.720]   So let's talk about I beacon.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.880]   What I found very interesting this week was the nugget.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880]   Okay.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.480]   So first of all, what is Harry, maybe you can explain what is I beacon?
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.160]   It's a apple technology that uses Bluetooth.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:27.000]   They're very precisely determined where somebody with an iOS seven devices within an enclosed
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.840]   space such as an apple store and they're using it with a new version of the apple store
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:38.800]   app so that if you're looking at an iPad in the iPad section of the apple store, they
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.200]   note the app knows that and can do things such as give you information to help you decide
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:49.520]   to buy an iPad and it uses Bluetooth L E. But what I found very the thing I learned or we
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.680]   all learned this week is that it turns out every Bluetooth L E device that Apple's been
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.600]   making and that goes back to the iPhone 4s.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.480]   Maybe even the four is also a beacon.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.320]   So I've thought for a long time you had to buy a beacon.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.760]   It's glue a beacon to the wall.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.680]   You are a beacon.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:13.720]   Every so there are stores where they talk about LeBron James shoe store in Miami LeBron's
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.080]   shoe store.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.800]   Every shoe has an iPad display that goes with a shoe.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.280]   That's not uncommon nowadays to see that kind of thing on a showroom floor.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:29.000]   Every one of those iPads turns out to be already an I beacon that can with some simple setup
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.400]   be set to say to your iPhone or your other Bluetooth L E device.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.160]   Oh, you're over here by the, you know, the Nike's.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.720]   Maybe you'd like to go over to Adidas or whatever or here's a coupon.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.520]   It also could be useful for more than retail, right?
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.080]   I mean, you could use it in museum, I guess.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.080]   Are there some non commercial uses for this?
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.520]   Yeah, I mean, if your phone is your beacon, you could also use it theoretically.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520]   Here I am.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.640]   Turn on lights as you enter your house.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.040]   So anything that should be triggered by your presence, you could use your beacon for especially
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.360]   since it's low powered.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.680]   Now you want to know why Apple by Topsy?
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.160]   It's for some stuff like this.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.600]   These beacons are a major source of big data for Apple.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.560]   If they can correlate your beacon to something you tweeted, something you put on Facebook,
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.640]   you said, Oh, my MacBook's getting so slow.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.680]   The next time you walk into an Apple store and you walk next to the MacBooks, it goes,
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.520]   Oh, you know, why don't you try this?
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.880]   No, it's been three years since you bought your last MacBook.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.040]   This is so much better.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.320]   They can custom tailor using that the Topsy engine.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.560]   It's actually kind of brilliant.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.160]   Well, and the brilliant stealth move is that they've been building this in every Apple
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.920]   device for the last two years.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.120]   And we didn't know it.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.560]   And they flipped the switch in effect.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.760]   And I think that's where Apple can really surprise people is to say, Oh yeah, by the
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.440]   way, it's already everywhere you are.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440]   Does this kill NFC Jessica?
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.280]   Oh, I was just going to say that.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.760]   Someone's saying, yeah, no.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.240]   I mean, to me, when this comes out, I think, you know, everyone's been waiting for Apple's
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.760]   move in mobile payments.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.440]   And it was clear they never put NFC in any of their devices.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.320]   It was clear they didn't and Google did and everybody else did was betting on it.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   And Apple didn't, which actually isn't that unusual for Apple.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.320]   I mean, people think of the company as very innovative and defining new categories, but
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.080]   it does so by sort of coming in right when there's a more mainstream tipping point.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.400]   And so not in the very, very early innings.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.960]   And so they did.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.600]   They sat and they sort of waited on payments.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.520]   And I think the sense I was getting from reporting inside the company was that, you
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.720]   know, they really didn't want, they wanted to do something that was much bigger and more
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.680]   leverage than just sort of point to point payments.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:45.960]   And I think it's still unclear exactly what they have in mind, but very clear that this
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.600]   is the technology they're betting on to do it.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:56.520]   And I still don't think they'll come out with a square killer or PayPal killer in exact,
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.280]   it may have that effect of harming those companies, but I don't think they're going
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.520]   to release a product that directly resembles those products, but something broader, something
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.080]   tied in and has a sort of platform components for app developers.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.440]   But yeah, I can't see much of a big future for NFC.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.800]   You know, it was sort of wavering for a while anyway, but now that Apple's placed its bets,
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.120]   I'll be interesting to see.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.080]   You know, I barely even used any of those products and fairly early adopters.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.320]   So I don't think it's that hard to pull out a credit card.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:36.040]   So I'm not sure what the next innovation will come in payments, but I think it's got to
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:42.160]   be a lot more than just that sort of point of sale thing and more around software and,
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.920]   you know, offers and other kinds of stuff.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:52.440]   You know, PayPal and September announced a beacon, they called it beacon device for payments
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.760]   with Bluetooth low energy.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.920]   So this is, I mean, this, but what Apple was down, Jessica, you did the best articles
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.480]   about Apple when you were at the journal.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.520]   Did you know, I mean, I read it religion.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:09.400]   Did you have any clue that Apple had this very clever stealth?
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.200]   This seems to me a stealth strike.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.880]   I think not directly.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:20.240]   No, I did write about payments and I, and I, the main story I did on the subject in Apple
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.480]   was from the point of view of like, basically a division inside the company a bit on strategy
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:31.520]   and, and figuring out at the most senior levels how aggressive to be and, and how not aggressive
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.520]   to be.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.760]   And I think that this was a timeframe of probably 18 months ago.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.160]   And it was clear that they were sitting on the sidelines because of NFC.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:46.680]   But I think that Bluetooth out, they've been very vocal about their support of Bluetooth
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680]   Ali.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.160]   I mean, Apple people actually are very involved in the standard setting around it.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.440]   So that was one bit hint that there was something like this, but.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.920]   And we knew, I mean, we knew if you had a Fitbit, which used Bluetooth Ali, you knew
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.840]   which devices a Fitbit would work with.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:08.280]   It was a iPhone four and S and later a Mac mini, a MacBook Air and iPad.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:13.040]   Yeah, I mean, Bluetooth Ali knew it worked, but who knew that was a beacon and it'll be
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.320]   hard for the rest of the industry to catch up just because Apple only has to make Bluetooth
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.760]   Ali work in a few devices and Google us ticket events every handset maker that uses Android
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   to support it.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   Ellie in a similar manner, which is going to take a while.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.200]   There are Bluetooth Ali Android devices in galaxies as three and four do it.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.280]   Yeah, I'm not going to get a standard though.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.480]   It is far from a standard.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.160]   Everybody everybody's standardized on NFC.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.840]   Everybody but Apple had put NFC in their phones.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.800]   Microsoft hedge their bets, both the surface has, I think, no, maybe it doesn't have NFC.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.200]   It has Ali.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.920]   The Nokia has a NFC.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.200]   I don't necessarily see them killing each other off.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:57.800]   NFC requires some sort of active motion from the user.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.160]   When I have to tap it, when I want to bump with somebody, I'm actually holding my phone
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.400]   against theirs or I'm tapping a payment screen.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.960]   I beacon is it's more of a location where technology, it could be used for a payment.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.920]   It could be used for a lot of stuff.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.360]   Yeah, when you walk up to you and your I beacon would say, here's my contact information.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.640]   Quick set makes a lock that unlocks when I get near it.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.840]   It only works with an iPhone because it's Bluetooth, Ali.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.120]   But make they own this.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.440]   I'm more worried about that.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.000]   I mean, I'm just security security.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.280]   Just from the wireless perspective, the things that I could do if you've got a pervasive
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   beacon on you.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.600]   I mean, that's you.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.360]   I admit and of course we're all sensitive to that now.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:49.600]   But I just feel like there isn't room for two that one of these, no, if I'm a shopkeeper
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.480]   I'm looking carefully to see what to install.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.640]   I'm not thinking, oh, I'll buy both.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.200]   I'm looking at what I can afford one and I'm waiting to see.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:06.480]   I think there was a lot of, I was mad that Apple didn't announce NFC on its 5S because
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:13.000]   I thought that's bad because if they don't do it, then that makes every shopkeeper go,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.840]   well, I'm not going to take a chance until I see what Apple's doing.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.640]   There's also this in terms of a chicken and the end problem.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.480]   So the advocates of NFC say that it's not going to require shopkeepers to do it because
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.400]   the actual credit card companies just need to adopt it and they refresh their point of
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.520]   sale terminals, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:41.200]   So it actually doesn't require a huge burden in the point of view of the retailers.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.640]   I'm not sure that's true.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.760]   I think the, but it is interesting.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:52.240]   I mean, I think we have to, we're at this point where there is going to be, people are going
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.000]   to have to make choices about what to adopt and I think.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.240]   And they already, many of them have iPads.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.240]   Right.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240]   They got it.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.160]   What they didn't know was they already have beacons.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.080]   What I didn't know till this week.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.880]   I think talk, talk about KG move by Apple.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:15.680]   You know, and yes, I mean, strategically it's very, very savvy.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.120]   But I can read an Ibekin from dozens of feet away.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.880]   I need to be with an interest to read an NFC tag.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:29.120]   So if I'm stuck in the mind, if you're talking about security, tap to pay is more secure.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   That's what I like.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   I like that.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:35.480]   I like the ability to say there is no way for me to read your NFC tag from across the
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   room.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.440]   Unless I'm sitting there with a Yagi antenna and you're probably going to notice it.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.360]   Whereas with an Ibekin, the whole purpose of an Ibekin is to use low power but give location
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.640]   data a distance away.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.240]   So now let's say you go into an Apple store.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.600]   You're surrounded by 50 people all crunching to get the latest iPad.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.920]   Are you really going to use that as your payment system with all those beacons active
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   at the same time?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.720]   So in this case, probably not.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.720]   Right.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.720]   But you're not going to use NFC either because you're Apple.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720]   Probably not.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.240]   No, you're going to have to figure out some solution.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:11.920]   I just think it's been a while since we've seen a company do something this clever and
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.560]   surreptitious.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.400]   I don't think anybody had any inkling that Apple was putting.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.040]   We all knew it was a receiver but nobody knew that we could.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.960]   They were actually building Ibekins into every single device.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.560]   This is there are hundreds of millions of Ibekins out there now.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.560]   I got one.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560]   You got one.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.560]   Everybody here's got one.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.600]   This is Apple's Oprah moment.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   You get an Ibekin.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   Yes.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   You get an Ibekin.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   You all get Ibekins.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600]   Fascinating.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.680]   When you're right, there's a privacy issue and all that.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.680]   Let's take a break.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.680]   When we come back, I want to talk about Bitcoin.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.280]   I want to talk about 23 in me.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.840]   I spit into a tube.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.640]   Have any of you spit into a tube?
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.640]   I have.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   Oh, I have.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.480]   Well, I want to talk about it because, well, there's a whole story there.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.680]   Great team here.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680]   We really haven't some fun.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.840]   Harry McCracken is the technologist from time.com.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.720]   What are you working on these days?
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.720]   How are they gift-died?
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.720]   Well, we won't stop.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.120]   All of our gift guides are done, thank heavens.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.120]   Oh, God, I hate that.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120]   I hate this time of year.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.320]   I was trying to think about 2014 and talking about the year ahead.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.680]   CES is going to be huge this year or just a lot of TVs.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.680]   Both.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:28.320]   I mean, and I actually have an email filter which is taking all of my CES related email
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.480]   and diverting it into a special folder.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.160]   I turn that on every year about this time.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.920]   If I didn't do that, I wouldn't be able to see anything else.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.920]   All the press releases.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:40.320]   We would like to meet with you to talk about our new thing.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.280]   Well, we look forward to seeing what's going on at time.com and the technologist.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:51.280]   Mr. Robert Ballisair, the father, this week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.120]   This is Enterprise Tech, isn't it, I beacon?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   This is Enterprise Tech.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.120]   Yes.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   We're getting big data.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.760]   This is a big data is everywhere.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.880]   I mean, the other thing is the location thing.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.400]   It kind of pales in comparison to the location data you're already giving out just by having
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.400]   a cell phone.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.320]   So you're beaconing every moment of the day.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   Exactly.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.600]   Jessica, lesson, the information.com, $39 a month.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.480]   As she said before the show began, hey, that's what it cost a park for our day in San Francisco.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.280]   How much could that be?
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280]   That's why I live in Petaluma, Jessica.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   Fair enough.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.880]   Freeze, street parking.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   Two Uber rides.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   Two Uber rides.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:30.680]   A six pack of lattes.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.000]   I could go on and on.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.600]   It sounds like it's worth $400.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.440]   And by the way, immediately after the show I'm paying for it.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.720]   And also, we thank Chad Johnson, our producer for his red hair.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:49.520]   I learned something interesting at the Christmas party on Friday.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520]   About me?
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.760]   About you and Father Robert Ballester.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.280]   So Father Robert, I guess you were doing this, was like in the middle of the night, even
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.640]   though the cameras were on, because we were always on here at the beautiful percast.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.440]   I finally realized that what I'm doing is reality TV.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.800]   I thought it was tech coverage.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.240]   This is reality TV is what we do here.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:16.880]   You stuffed, okay, did you or did you not stuff a pig down the hole underneath the tricaster
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.880]   here?
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   Did you not?
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   Did you or did you not?
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.040]   I like to take the fifth.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040]   It was not a live pig.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.120]   It wasn't a live pig.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.640]   We was a little rubber pig.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.720]   We were playing around with the tricaster.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   Alex was downstairs.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.280]   And Chad and I were upstairs.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:38.400]   We were going to show the mascot pig from the TV desk coming down through the little
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400]   thing.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.400]   To say hello.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.720]   And so we had a camera shot of it going into the hole and it never came out.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.120]   So a pig got stuck.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.320]   So many people don't understand that.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.880]   But the way we do this are technical director's desk, rotating desk.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.560]   That's where Chad is right now.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.520]   Are you going to rotate it?
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520]   It actually rotates.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:01.960]   And when it rotates, the camera goes with it, which is bizarre.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.320]   But in order for that to work, you've got to have all the equipment, all the wires from
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.640]   the equipment go down into the basement where all the gear is through a hole.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.560]   And that hole is fairly large.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.320]   It's eight inches in diameter.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.080]   Yeah, it should have fallen right through.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.720]   Pig should have gone right through it.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:23.080]   But the funniest thing is I found at Russell, our IT guy, Russell Tammany, he had to rescue
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.480]   the pig, reached up.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.520]   And he said, when the pig came out, so did a bunch of red hairs.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.720]   I don't know where that came from, honestly.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.440]   Chad, I don't know either.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.240]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.840]   Chad, he's adjusting the cameras so we can see his red hair.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.680]   So here's, you know, here's the desk.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.680]   That's the view from the desk.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.680]   Right.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.680]   Right.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.080]   And so when you're sitting there, do you feel like you're piloting a 747?
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.280]   It's like my first 7.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.280]   Absolutely.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:57.520]   I mean, I think if we count, there's 12 computers on this desk that we have access to.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.160]   And then way down there, there's where the desk pivots.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.760]   It's hard to see because of the studio lights and underneath the desk.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.520]   Was that your hair or game games here?
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.520]   I mean, it's my, I mean, people's hair falls out right there.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.520]   That's great.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.920]   It's a shot you won't see a lot on network television.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920]   But you're a twit.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   We get no secrets.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.280]   Everyone's hair falls out.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.640]   It's just mind's a little bit easier to notice when it comes to--
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   You could have been up there.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.560]   When the pig picks it up through the hole at the bottom of the TV desk.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.520]   We got some good news this week about our friend Dana Atkinson, who was a founder at
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.240]   Squarespace, went off to create a new company called Sumall, just raised, I think, $4 million
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.880]   in venture capital.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.680]   Sumall is truly amazing and one of our sponsors and we love them.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.760]   Talk about big data and data analysis.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.120]   The idea of Sumall, and it's free, which is pretty good because if you were trying to,
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.760]   you know, if you were using one of, you know, SAS or something, that's some big bucks on
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.760]   this stuff.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   It is free.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:59.200]   You connect up all your services, your Twitter, Facebook, Google+, your Instagram, your YouTube,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.160]   your four-square, your Tumblr, Google Blogger, WordPress, Google Analytics, Moz, Bit--
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.920]   You can see everything, eBay.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.480]   If you're selling on eBay, for instance, you can say, what is the correlation between
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.000]   sales and Twitter feeds or a particular Twitter poster?
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.920]   How does my Instagram feed drive content?
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:21.560]   Should I-- when my mail stuff from Mailchipper Constant Contact, you can see how valuable
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.480]   this is to get a view.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.800]   This is something that big business has been doing for years, but nobody's been able to
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.120]   afford this as a small business.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.040]   We use it and it is so valuable to us in managing our social media campaigns, understanding,
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:39.160]   you know, how t-shirt sales are impacted by some of the things we do.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.120]   Lots of people now are using it and you can too.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.960]   Some all-- the insane growth is in 20% growth over the last month.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:53.080]   Now there are 60,000 companies and customers using some all's data analytics service.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.840]   They've recently added some new ones like Four Square and I mentioned Instagram, Tumblr,
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.840]   and Blogger.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.920]   Stripe-- do you stripe for credit cards?
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.520]   If you use Squarespace, you're using Stripe for their commerce.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.360]   Braintree, big commerce, and more.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.000]   You get improved modern analytics.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.320]   You get integration with related data streams.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.280]   You get personalized daily or weekly emails so that you don't have to even-- you get pushed
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.280]   the information.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.480]   There's an export and spreadsheet view.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.920]   Many, many features.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.320]   Some all now has a mobile app too that's gorgeous on the iPhone.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   Is that your data chat?
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.320]   Yeah, this is.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.320]   You track like YouTube hits and-- Yeah, so this blue line right here is the amount of
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.120]   subscribers that I've gained.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.440]   Well, what happened on that peak there?
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   This day--
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   That's an awesome one.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.760]   It's actually really cool because you can-- you know--
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.320]   You want to know why this happened?
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.520]   This actually was I was on NSFW that day.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   There you go.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.520]   Look at that.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.040]   And so I gained 100 and I can even jump in here and say, you know what?
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.320]   On this day, I'd like to make a little note about it.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   You know, I--
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   That's awesome.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.920]   Was on NSFW because in a year you're going to see that spike and go--
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.920]   I don't remember what.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   What?
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920]   How did that happen?
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:27:59.920]   How can I recreate that?
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.320]   It is critical these days to be successful.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320]   Exactly.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.320]   And overlaying multiple versions of information and even splitting it out to compare so I
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.920]   can compare, you know, this is one week of YouTube versus another week and you can see
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:15.920]   the--
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   You can line them up.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:18.920]   Right.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.320]   And I can, you know, decide, you know, both of these needs to be--
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.560]   You know, now this is a week versus a week to find out, you know, how I'm performing over
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.560]   time.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.560]   And you don't pay for this, right?
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560]   I know.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.560]   Absolutely.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.560]   I don't--
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   That's what I don't really quite understand.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   But hey, I'm not going to look a gift towards the mouth.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]   Absolutely.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.680]   And the amount of platforms, you know, I only have a few platforms that I'm worried about,
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.680]   but you could do so many.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.680]   There are so many.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.680]   There's so many.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680]   That's amazing.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.080]   Hey, get a your free account right now, sumall.com and try it out today.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.640]   It's not like there's a free trial period.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   It's free.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640]   I don't know how they do it.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   Sumall.com.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:56.480]   And we're just going to take a break while I watch the 49ers win this game.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.800]   Let's get a very exciting over here.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:05.240]   Because I think if they do, they have a shot at getting into the wild card and Jessica,
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.360]   you obviously are not an NFL fan or you wouldn't even be here today.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360]   I am barely--
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.360]   You're a mild fan.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360]   Is Sam at the game?
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   I'll support this.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360]   No, not.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.280]   But we'll support the 49ers all day long.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.640]   It's very exciting and it looks like it might be almost over.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   We'll see.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.440]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.440]   Bitcoin.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.440]   Yes.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.920]   Talk about distractions.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.920]   What the hell?
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.440]   Father Robert Bellisser, what the hell?
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.040]   Okay, so we know that Bitcoin is this--
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.040]   It's cryptocurrency.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   It's a cryptocurrency.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.040]   It's a cryptocurrency.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   Right.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.560]   So you have to set your computer to decipher an increasingly difficult cryptographic challenge
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.160]   in order to earn a Bitcoin.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.800]   Now way back in the day, you know, two thousand--
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800]   You could mine.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.600]   You could do it on your computer and you'd get like a thousand over the summer.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:58.200]   Now you need a custom, basically, because $5,000 to even have a shot at it.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.200]   Right.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.880]   Because every time you decrypt a Bitcoin, it gets more difficult to get the next one.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.600]   Well, one of the things about Bitcoin was, well, who created it.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:12.240]   And there's all these wonderfully crazy hypotheses about where it came from.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.720]   The NSA created it to destabilize toward world economies.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.720]   No, really?
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.920]   Yeah, it was created by mobsters, always created by a geek at MIT, or it was created by a group
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.080]   of geeks at Stanford.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.920]   Well, we've got a story here that talks about how the 49ers have just won the game.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.920]   Oh, so that's a good story.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.920]   Big story.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.920]   No, sorry, no.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:30.920]   They have nine seconds left.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:31.920]   I don't think there's any way they lose the game.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   They're different.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:39.480]   While they do that, what we're talking about with Bitcoin is that they think they have
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:44.480]   identified who actually-- Satoshi created it.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.760]   So this is an interesting part of the story.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:53.320]   A guy named or a group of guys, we don't know, or gals, or whoever named Satoshi Nakamoto,
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.880]   released Bitcoin to the wild some years ago.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:00.800]   And everyone agrees that the math behind it, the theory behind it, economic theory behind
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.440]   it, is rock solid.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.920]   And whoever did this is very smart.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:12.000]   But this person, probably wisely, whoever he or she is, or whoever he or they are, is
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.960]   anonymous and never revealed their identity.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.760]   Nakamoto did communicate with a few people on forums and so forth.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:27.240]   And a guy named Zabo, Nick Zabo, has done some syntactic analysis.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.040]   Which is not-- This is not the first time this has happened.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040]   No geeking out over that.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:32.680]   Nick, no, Nick is the guy that I think is Satoshi.
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:38.040]   Oh, Nick is Satoshi, the guy who did these syntactic analysis, is another guy.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   There's the blog post.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.040]   She's a she, I believe.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.040]   She.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.560]   Anyway, whoever that is.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:47.200]   So they're looking for specific phrases that people use, a certain type of syntax, because
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   that's like a fingerprint.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.520]   We all write in certain ways.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.880]   Nick was involved with cryptocurrency and then he sort of suddenly became left-- Stop talking
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   about it.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:06.560]   I've seen-- We had the director of the Bitcoin Foundation on triangulation some months ago.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.520]   And there was some speculation he might be at Nakamoto.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.560]   Nakamoto kind of handed off the reins to him and he's kind of run the thing.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.320]   Although it doesn't need to be run by anybody.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.720]   I mean, at this point, nobody needs to do anything.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:21.600]   This was the guy-- I'm trying to remember his name-- who was giving away bitcoins for
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.600]   a while.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.080]   You're trying to seed it.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:28.680]   But I have to say, I mean, there's been syntactic analysis before.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.800]   It's not the first time.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.480]   There are lots of theories about who Nakamoto is.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.000]   I guess it doesn't really matter unless it's the NSA.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.640]   And then even then, doesn't matter.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:44.800]   I feel like it's just a great story.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.080]   It's of great interest.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.720]   There's certainly been, from the financial point of view, a lot of speculation.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.280]   Things are going back down now.
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:59.400]   They peaked at well over 1,000 bucks, but now down to $800 on Mt. Gox.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:03.600]   You can see from this graph of one month how spiky it is.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.760]   I mean, it goes all over the place.
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:11.360]   One of the things that the story really exposes is there was a little bit of a blip in the
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:16.760]   value of Bitcoin because there was a story about, oh, well, why was Bitcoin created?
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:22.600]   And the creator of Bitcoin actually has now, what is it, a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin?
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.400]   It's in the current currency.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.400]   He's a billionaire.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.640]   So that would be a good reason to create it and disappear.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.640]   It's a good reason.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.640]   Right.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.640]   Exactly.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.280]   But now people are drawing back from that story.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.280]   They're saying, wait a minute.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.400]   So the people who got into this early are making tons of money off of what we're doing
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.400]   now.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.960]   If you're getting into Bitcoin now, you have no chance of really mining any sort of fortune.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.480]   Whereas the people who were in it at the beginning have a vested interest in getting more and
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.960]   more people to buy in the Bitcoin.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.320]   It's almost a pyramid scheme in that case.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.320]   Pyramid scheme.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.760]   I also think, Robert, that raises a lot of questions.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:02.200]   There's a lot of discussion I hear now about what's the future of Bitcoin mining and is
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.680]   there going to be money to be made off that anymore?
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.200]   Because right now there essentially isn't because it's so cost prohibitive.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.840]   But I hear a lot about discussions of new ways and distributed versions around mining
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.680]   where the sort of insiders are trying to once again get an advantage.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.760]   So that will be an interesting thing to watch.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:29.800]   But I am personally fascinated by how the Bitcoin believers, if you will, have essentially
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.640]   -- it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.560]   The more they talk about it, the more they invest in companies that are related to it.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.800]   I think that's certainly driven the pattern we've seen.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.920]   I haven't thought too much about it, but I wonder if it parallels other trends in technology
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.480]   too, you know, have other things like app stores or other sort of innovations been driven
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.560]   by the early adopters who then help make them self-fulfilling prophecies because I think
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.560]   that's playing out.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.640]   That's kind of the nature of a bubble in general, isn't it?
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.400]   All bubbles are that way.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.400]   Get in early.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.080]   What's the difference is like, is that just a sort of priming mechanism and then more fundamentals
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.960]   take over and businesses do get built and there are opportunities or not?
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.480]   I mean, I think we're still in the early days.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.000]   So it's hard to tell, although Bitcoin's been around for a very, very long time too.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.400]   And this is not the first time -- I mean, it's the first time that it's gotten to this
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.840]   level, but it's had many booms and busts for years as well.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.440]   I think that's something that you don't often read a lot about.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.680]   Some names, by the way, I'm so bad.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]   I apologize.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.760]   I'm just an old man.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.920]   The researcher was Sky Gray, who came up with the names Nixzabo.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.840]   And the guy we interviewed is the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin and Drason.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.040]   And that's a worthwhile interview.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:54.720]   If you're interested in Bitcoin on one of our triangulation episodes a few months ago.
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:03.400]   You know, the boom bust cycle that happened with technology in the '90s, and parallel
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:09.320]   something that happened with the railroads in the 19th century, the companies that built
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.160]   the Transcontinental Railroads almost all went bankrupt, and their investors lost almost
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.200]   everything.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:22.040]   But we got the infrastructures from it to power a complete revolution in the United States
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.240]   economy.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.320]   The same thing in the '90s, in the late '90s, early 2000s, a lot of people lost money on
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.080]   pets.com and .com startups like that.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.320]   But the infrastructure that was laid, the fiber alone that was laid has made a huge difference
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.920]   in the economy in years to follow.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.920]   So there may be a reason for a bust boom cycle.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.400]   But I guess what you have to do is look back in time.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:51.280]   The difference between a pyramid scheme and a boom bust cycle is only history can tell
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   the difference.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.760]   I think that's really the only difference.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.760]   Maybe that's it.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.000]   And there's no law applying to Bitcoin as far as I can tell.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.880]   It seems to be a very wild west thing.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.200]   Let's talk about 23andMe.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:07.640]   The Federal Drug Administration, FDA, has effectively shut down 23andMe.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.400]   23andMe was a very interesting startup by Anne Wojcicki.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.760]   Am I saying her name right?
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.640]   I never say it right.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   Wojcicki.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.200]   Wojcicki, is that right?
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.520]   She was Larry Page's wife.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.520]   Circuit brand.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.520]   You have to see, I'm an old man.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520]   Still is, I believe.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.440]   Maybe still married, but separated or something.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.680]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.360]   I can't follow all this stuff.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.160]   However, that's neither here nor there.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:39.920]   It was of, I think, a really interesting idea to bring genetic analysis to the cost point
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.080]   where almost anybody could do it.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.920]   But the last time I did it was 99 bucks.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.680]   And you spit into a tube and you get a big analysis back.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:54.640]   But a lot, and a lot of people have been said, "Oh, the reason the FDA shut it down was they
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.160]   didn't want competition."
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:02.680]   Or I think actually what the FDA did was kind of realistic because I did pay for 23andMe.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.000]   And I'm curious, you did it too, right?
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   I did.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   Jessica, have you done 23andMe?
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   I did.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.360]   I learned that I metabolized caffeine quickly.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.560]   Yeah, it's like useless crap.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:16.520]   The only thing that is stuck with me from it, but I drink diet coke late at night.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.520]   I have wet earwax.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.680]   That's what I learned.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.680]   And like a 2%.
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:27.440]   No, that's a genetic marker.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.280]   Okay.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.280]   What do you have?
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.280]   Have you looked?
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.280]   Go look on your 23andMe.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   I cannot process alcohol.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.040]   Which I already knew.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.480]   You knew that.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.040]   The fear the FDA had, first of all, the FDA didn't have any fear.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.400]   The FDA went to them and said, "You need to explain how you do what you do, why you
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:49.600]   make the conclusions that you make, and it needs to be very clear."
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.880]   Now, 23andMe has a big disclaimer on the front page.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.040]   We have suspended our health-related genetic tests to comply with the FDA to discontinue
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.400]   new consumer access during our regulatory review process.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.080]   I don't think this is inappropriate.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:08.280]   I think there should be a, there was no regulatory review because what you get from 23andMe could
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.360]   scare the living daylights out of you.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.000]   And you can still buy the kits, I believe.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.160]   You just can't get the health.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.160]   Malicis.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.040]   You get an analysis of what your genetic composition is.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.600]   You get that the ancestry stuff.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   Even that, I didn't find that useful.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.560]   I'm going to log into my 23andMe.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.880]   It's the same reason why we don't like those instant disease tests.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.160]   You want to do that in the presence of a trained medical personnel so they could explain to
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.760]   you what the test actually means.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:39.120]   They could keep you from doing something drastic if you find really, really bad news.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.000]   So I get what they're trying to do with this.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.240]   And 23andMe, as they were positioning themselves, could have been seen as, we will tell you
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.040]   whether or not you're going to live a long life.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.520]   That's not a great thing to do if you can't actually back it up at science.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.520]   Right.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.760]   And I think that's what's going on right now.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:00.800]   Now here's my 23andMe and I did this before the FDA.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.640]   So a lot of what, I'm 2.6% Neanderthal.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   Sweet.
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.640]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:09.480]   And I, it explains why I got hair on my knuckles.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.480]   My ancestry composition and all of that.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.120]   But then there's also health risks.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:19.800]   And this is, I think, where they get in a little bit of trouble because it can be scary.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.840]   For instance, that you have a doubled, my risk is 1.24 times higher for coronary heart
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.840]   disease.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:27.840]   But then you dig down into it.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.800]   It's because I'm a European, Western European genetic and that's what you get.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.760]   And I think some people might get scared.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.280]   And I think what they want to avoid is an Angelina Jolie moment where a woman says, "I'm going
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.880]   to have a double mastectomy because of what 23andMe said."
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.960]   Now the point is well made that you're not, nobody's going to give you a double mastectomy
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.360]   just because 23andMe said it.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.640]   You still have to go to a doctor to do it.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:55.400]   Nevertheless, I think that it's appropriate for 23andMe to reveal to the FDA and ultimately
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:00.080]   to its users how this works.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.640]   Right.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640]   Right.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.280]   Do you, did you find it useful, Jessica?
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.560]   You know, I found it fun.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.760]   I remember doing it.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   And I remember.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.640]   I had this cool, my parents did it.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.160]   So then I saw that I had one chromosome from my mom and one friend dad.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.960]   And that was very exciting.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:22.800]   But I haven't, I don't think I've dipped back into it in a few years having done it.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:29.080]   And to me, this whole episode raises this point that, I mean, we know that science and
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.920]   technology are sort of colliding and that medicine and technology are colliding.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.440]   And 23andMe is only one of a million companies trying to do something in this space or something
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.040]   related to health.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.560]   And I just wonder what the relationship between the regulators and the Valley is going to
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.040]   be over these new technologies.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.240]   I mean, even if you think about wearable devices today, which are fairly benign and
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.240]   tracking our steps, they could do so much more.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.400]   And as a consumer and companies and entrepreneurs are working on so much more.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.720]   And as a consumer, I really want to see these exist.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.000]   But I also realized that, you know, there are many consumers who need protecting for
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]   a good reason.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.560]   So I think we, you know, we at work, the information too, we've been thinking a lot about what the
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.000]   intersection of this landscape is going to look like and trying to understand a bit how
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.720]   companies out here are going to get their products through and what's the best way.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.960]   And because another interesting thing about this episode, I think, was that 23andMe had
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.160]   been out for so long.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.840]   I mean, so we've used it and it's been on the market.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.880]   And so there's certainly a lag in the pushback.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.400]   But, you know, will there be a chilling factor now?
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.960]   So it's going to be a very interesting space to watch.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.720]   And I think a lot of people were surprised to see this reaction from the FDA.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.960]   And, you know, we'll just have to see.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.720]   But I get it.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:56.120]   I mean, these things are important and there's a lot of stuff that normal consumers are,
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.720]   people are going to have to be worried about and made aware of.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:04.160]   But, you know, frankly, I think this kind of genetic testing is fairly, you know, benign
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.840]   compared to what's technologically possible or will be very shortly.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.080]   And so what's the fate of that?
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.080]   Absolutely.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.520]   I think that in a way, that's what we're talking about here is this is a kind of a toy
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:20.840]   genetic analysis that is, and should probably be labeled for entertainment purposes only.
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:21.840]   Please.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.240]   For cocktail party, Bob.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:24.480]   Yeah, do not act upon this.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.480]   My first genetic analysis.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.480]   Because this reminds me a little bit of, remember when the Myers-Briggs and the Enneagram were
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.480]   so huge?
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.480]   Everybody was doing it.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.480]   And then people were breaking it out, "Oh, well, I do that because I'm a five with wings."
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480]   Right.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.840]   Or, "I do that because I'm an ENTJ."
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:44.000]   Well, until you get more science behind this and actually show me why there's a genetic
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]   correlation here.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000]   Exactly.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000]   It's the same thing.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.800]   It could be someone saying, "Oh, well, I do that because 23andMe told me that I need
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:50.800]   more coffee."
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.640]   And, by the way, it may not be over.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.600]   I think that they're going to talk, they should have talked with the FDA from the beginning.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.040]   They're going to talk with them now, show them what happens, and I think they will come
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.040]   to a conclusion.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.040]   And, you know what?
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.480]   And then I would say this is a great holiday gift.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.880]   But it's a toy, and that's the point.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:06.880]   It's not.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.600]   And having done it, and I think three of us have done it, I think we all agree, unless
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.920]   you really care about how much Neanderthal you have or whether your ear wax is wet.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:15.920]   I'm like 50%.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:16.920]   It's weird.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:17.920]   What?
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.920]   No.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920]   No.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   In fact, it's a...
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:21.920]   I don't like it.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.920]   No, it's for...
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:23.920]   Wait.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.480]   Anybody of Ann says European interest is 2.6%.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.480]   Right.
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.040]   So it's like, "Oh."
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.600]   So you're saying it's just normal.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.600]   Right.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.160]   I think we...
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:39.360]   Unless there's anything anybody wants to talk about, I think we're going to wrap this
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.360]   puppy up.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360]   I'm just...
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.200]   I'm looking here.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200]   Anything...
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:52.240]   We now know that many federal agencies use floppy disks to send data to the federal
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.240]   register.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.240]   This is a publication that published...
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240]   Where do they buy them?
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.160]   Where do they buy them?
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.160]   Where do they use them?
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.160]   What...
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.720]   Are they going to stock pups somewhere?
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.280]   It's brilliant.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.800]   The problem with using USB drives for sneakernet is that people can intercept them and get the
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.800]   data.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   Right.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.600]   If you get one of their floppy disks, what the heck are you going to do with it?
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.600]   So this is for the federal register, which is a daily publication of the federal government
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.920]   that's required to publish changes in executive orders, proclamations, rule changes, and so
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:20.920]   forth.
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.600]   All the federal agencies contribute to it.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:23.680]   Some of them email.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.680]   That's possible.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.120]   It is illegal to use a USB key.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120]   Exactly.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.200]   They don't allow that.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:34.160]   Many of them CD-ROMs, but according to the New York Times, many of the agencies still
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.240]   send floppy disks in.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.480]   The spokesman for the federal register wouldn't say which agencies, because that's embarrassing,
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.840]   but they were monitoring the...
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.080]   At the register's office, couriers recently seen coming in and out as an employee pulled
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.920]   a floppy disk from one package and at least two CD-ROMs from the other.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.560]   I hope there are at least three and a half inch floppy disks rather than five and a quarter
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.320]   inch or eight inch floppy disks.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:02.120]   No, no, it's a five and a quarter and they had to punch a hole in the corner to double
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120]   slide it.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120]   Well, at least they're being economical.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.080]   Someday they'll move to Zepdesk's.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.080]   You're absolutely right, though.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.080]   Where the hell are they getting these?
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.320]   I tried to actually needed floppy disks last year and I went to fries thinking they might
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320]   have them.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320]   They didn't.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.080]   They actually went to the weird stuff warehouse, which you might know about.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.080]   Weird stuff has everything.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:26.240]   They didn't sell floppy disks, but ended up buying a vintage box of Microsoft Word, which
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.560]   used to come on floppy disks.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.080]   So I recycled a copy of Microsoft Word.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.360]   And what's fun is all your floppy disks are labeled Microsoft Word.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:42.000]   Chad has found that in fact you can go to Amazon.com and buy a iMation 1.44 megabyte floppy.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.240]   Now that is a Christmas gift.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.120]   I give that to the geek in your family.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.480]   Thirty five dollars for a box of ten.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.480]   What?
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.480]   That's my every.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.960]   Doesn't mono price sell floppies.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960]   That's ridiculous.
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:55.960]   That's the price per gigabyte.
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:56.960]   That's awesome.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.960]   Oh my God.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.160]   It is to least a good floppy drive.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.360]   I bought a floppy USB floppy drive from my MacBook Air at fries.
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.360]   Oh, that's good.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.200]   He's never any disks for it.
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.720]   I have USB floppy drive, zip drive.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.160]   I even have five and a quarter drive.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.480]   I keep just in case I ever come across a media.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:14.480]   I want to read.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.480]   You never know.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.480]   You never know.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480]   Good.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.800]   Because I have some floppies with stuff I haven't been able to get off.
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:24.440]   Next gen USB will be smaller and reversible, kind of like Apple's lightning connectors.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.440]   God.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.440]   God.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:27.440]   Oh, what?
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.760]   So it's going to break the connections from the old USB standard.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:35.160]   The USB 3.0 promoter group obviously was watching Apple and saying, hey, they got away
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.160]   with it.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.560]   We should try this.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.560]   That's sad.
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.120]   Although I do like the idea.
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:44.280]   I love the idea, but it means for the near term computers will have to have both types
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.760]   of USB connectors because no manufacturer is going to say, yeah, throw out everything
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.120]   you have that's USB.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.120]   And finally, good news from Congress.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.920]   And I hope it remains good news.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:05.000]   The House passed the Innovation Act, a law to slap patent trolls across the face with
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.400]   a big wet fish.
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:12.560]   By 325 to 91, they passed it without amendment, even though there were some attempts to amendment
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:13.560]   amended.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.760]   I presume it goes to the Senate.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.520]   We know the president will pass will sign it if it does because he supported it.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.800]   It's expected to the pass on to the White House.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:30.000]   If it becomes law, one of the big changes I think will be that it'll be possible to recover
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.120]   the costs of a failed lawsuit, which means it is not free to be a patent troll anymore
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.200]   or almost free to be a patent troll.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.440]   It could cost you.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.720]   I think that'll slow things down.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.920]   And they've also prohibited fee shifting.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:52.600]   I'm sorry, protection for consumers, which goes back to this issue about the, there was
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.400]   a company that had a scanner patent or a pen or a scanner scatting, either way, the
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.440]   pen or scatting.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.240]   They were going to end users of scanners.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.520]   They were actually going to businesses and saying, hey, you use a scanner and email the
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:06.880]   result, you owe us money.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.000]   And that will be also illegal.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000]   Thank goodness.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000]   Actually the big one.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.400]   We're going to talk about this tomorrow on Twyte, a cheaper deny, but the discovery rule
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:20.180]   is actually huge because one of the tactics that patent troll will often do is they will
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:21.720]   keep demanding discovery.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.920]   And it's the whole, we know you have the proof that will prove that you're guilty and we
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.480]   want you to give it to us.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.400]   And since the patent trolls are generally shells with no documents, there's nothing they have
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:32.400]   to do.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400]   Right.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.040]   But they can just sit back and just keep submitting request after request for discovery.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.840]   And every time they do that, it's costing you money.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:45.600]   As a participant in an industry that is plagued by a particular patent troll, I celebrate
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:49.000]   this and I look forward to this becoming a law soon.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.280]   Soon, soon, soon.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.240]   Harry, it's so great to have you.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.480]   Harry McCracken, the technologyizer time.com.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.040]   Great to have you.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.120]   What are you planning for the holidays going away?
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.680]   We are going to visit my sister in Austin, Texas.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.600]   It'll be warm there, I hope.
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.560]   Maybe, although it gets frosty there.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.720]   The barbecue will be good and the music will be fine.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.000]   So that's all that really matters.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000]   We have fun down there.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000]   Thank you.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000]   It's great to have you, Harry.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000]   Thanks for being here.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   Thank you, Father Robert Ballister.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.040]   You're back to work tomorrow with this week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.520]   No, I'm actually going to go down to Austin and visit Harry's sister.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520]   Good thinking.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520]   Let's all go.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.800]   It's nice and warm.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:28.000]   And Jessica, it's so great to have you, Jessica Lesson.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.040]   We've been trying to get you on since you left the journal.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:32.120]   I guess I understand now why you couldn't.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:33.120]   You're kind of busy.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.680]   We were a little busy, but it's great to be here.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.680]   This has been fun.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.680]   Good.

[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:40.200]   My check for $400 is on its way.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.200]   Check.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.200]   Thank you, sir.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.200]   Check.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.200]   Don't you use checks?
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.200]   I use NFC.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.200]   Oh, can I tap to pay?
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.760]   I've already I beaconed.

[01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:57.680]   twit.tv.

[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:03.840]   And thank you for being here.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.280]   All you have to do is email tickets@twit.tv and we'll put a singularly uncomfortable
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.760]   chair out for you.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.760]   You agree?
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:10.760]   Uncomfortable?
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.760]   We design them that way.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:13.760]   Come here, Brian.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.960]   We got to see Cheabert's hat before we sign off here.
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:21.600]   My steam co-host from this week in enterprise tech from Hawaii, by the way.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.000]   So naturally he is wearing a traditional Hawaiian garb.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.120]   In fact, I think any minute now is going to hit a log with a stick.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.720]   That is the Santa Angry Bird.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:34.680]   You just see the sounds he makes when you throw them across the room.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:37.640]   Thank you to Brian and Kathy for some delicious kona coffee.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.440]   That's what powered this show today.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:42.640]   If you can't watch live on-demand audio and video always available after the fact at
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:49.600]   twit.tv and whoever find our netcaster aggregated and distributed in violation of every patent

[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.560]   It's amazing.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.560]   What a twit.
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:58.560]   Do it the twit.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.560]   All right.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.560]   Do it the twit, baby.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.560]   Do it the twit.
