[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, a very special episode of Twit, our 10th anniversary episode.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.840]   It was April 17, 2005 that we recorded what we consider episode 1.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.400]   Actually, there was an episode before that episode 0 recorded in January of that year
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.480]   at the 21st Amendment brew pub.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.880]   And I think you were all there except for John C. de Vorek.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   Let me introduce the panel.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   We'll talk about it.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   And on my left, Robert Herron.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   Herron Fidelity.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   Great to see you, Robert.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.720]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   I'm so thrilled you guys could be here.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   Patrick Norton.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Hey.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.520]   My former-- you've been on Twit many times, but knew you from the screen savers as I knew
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   Robert and--
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   And knew me from the screen savers.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.080]   And both of you agree.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.240]   I used to check Leo's badge when he came into the building on the screen savers.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   You look familiar.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   He's a lovely man.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.000]   Were you here yesterday?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.680]   And of course, because Twit was really just a chance to get together with my old buddies
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.480]   from Tech TV, you were here for that.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.080]   John C. de Vorek wasn't on the first episode.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   No, no, no.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   You were on the third.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   I think so.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.160]   There's the famous episode where your Skype died and you were texting me and I was reading
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.080]   messages from de Vorek beyond the grave.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.560]   That was like 100 or something.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   That was deep.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   I remember we were in the little room.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.360]   David Prager, also here.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.840]   Happy to be back.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.880]   I still feel like I didn't deserve it.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.240]   To be on episodes zero, I was just happened to be there.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   So I'm still honored.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.880]   Everybody at the bar, just at the bar.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.080]   Everybody in that episode zero just happened to be there.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.200]   We went there and we specifically sat down and recorded something.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.840]   Well, I mean, I don't think anyone had any ideas.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   The screen savers was nothing without Prager.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.400]   The ability to just say when something went wrong.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.560]   Prager is great.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.520]   We have a new guy, by the way.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   His name is Needles.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   Needles.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   And it's great.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.840]   You have to have somebody that you can shout his name.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   And he'll go--
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   Escape code.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   Yeah, Escape code.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   Well, that's one way to put it.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.080]   Roger Chang is also here.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   Good to see you.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.560]   And you worked with me on Call for Help as well as--
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.360]   Yeah, I started my internship two weeks before the network
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   launched.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.480]   And I was on screen savers and Call for Help.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.960]   I was PA till we got Prager to take over my place.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.360]   Somebody lower than you.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   That was me.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.440]   I mean, we're definitely going to talk about what you guys are all up to.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   We do-- I guess we should do our news.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.400]   You should also introduce this audience.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.640]   Look at the size of this group.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.040]   Well, and we had to cut it off.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.840]   Shoot a camera at it.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.760]   And I feel so bad because we got so many requests
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   to be part of this 10th anniversary show.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.960]   Yeah, standing room only.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   Look back there.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.880]   And I'm really thrilled to have everybody.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.440]   So thank you.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.520]   Yeah, everybody for being here.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.600]   We really appreciate it.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   Woo!
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.400]   And for those of you--
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   For those of you on the waiting list,
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.960]   I'm sorry we couldn't get you in.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.320]   But there's only one toilet.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.520]   And we just really didn't feel like it would be fair to all of you.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520]   And that's nervous after.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.800]   That was the fire marshal outside.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.520]   There's a cop out there.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.160]   There's a cop out there too.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.240]   But the first screensavers wasn't the first screensavers.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.960]   First-- [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.080]   Well, we called it the Revenge of the Screen Savers,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.880]   I think you may remember.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.800]   But the first one was just sitting around after a Mac
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.880]   world at a brew pub chatting.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.760]   And you had-- you saw that picture, Jason?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.240]   Because somebody tweeted the picture to David Prager of the group.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.480]   Now, you may notice there's one person missing from that group.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.680]   They're missing here today.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.760]   And that's Kevin Rose, who was going to be here.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.440]   Had to get on a plane, couldn't make it.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.720]   He has sent a video greeting, which we'll play a little bit later.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.840]   But look how fresh-faced Kevin looks.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.320]   He looks so young there.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.880]   Roger Chang, that's Patrick Norton's hair sticking out.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.840]   That's where you left it.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.600]   You might want to check.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.840]   He's still lovely Sarah Norton to your left, David Prager, and me.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.480]   And I had a recorder.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.640]   And I was very spontaneous.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.440]   And I didn't plan it.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.480]   I said, hey, let's just talk.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.560]   We talked for 20 minutes.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   30,000 people downloaded that episode.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.040]   And I thought, boy, it'd be great if it was--
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.840]   It was 30,000 people in the first day.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.480]   And then it got up to 130,000 in three weeks.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.720]   Yeah, you were like, I think we have a thing here.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.160]   We have a situation.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.280]   We've got to do-- but you were all in different places.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   And Kevin was in LA.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   And it just wasn't practicable to do a show.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.720]   And then I think it was on the radio show a couple months later.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   Somebody called him by a Skype.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.560]   I said, wow, that sounds good.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.520]   What if a light went off?
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.400]   We could do a show and everybody be on Skype.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.160]   So it was April.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.600]   It was in April of 2005 that I said, let's just try this.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   We'll call it-- we didn't have a name.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.520]   The revenge of the screen--
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.480]   I have a list of things you weren't here, John.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.880]   But you came soon after.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.320]   But a th--
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.400]   I was snubbed.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.640]   You, Patrick, decided you were leaving Sprint for Verizon.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.280]   Who is your carrier now?
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   AT&T.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.680]   Yeah, so you-- I was on Verizon for a whopping three months
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.320]   because I moved into a hole in the outer sunset of San
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   Francisco where Verizon did not work.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.960]   I had to walk two blocks to use my phone.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.680]   Verizon seems to be getting worse around here.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.440]   I don't know if it's worse in San Francisco.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.960]   Kevin said he hated his 3.650.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.920]   That was his phone.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   That was kind of the first smartphone, I think.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.760]   Is that the one that had the lid that flipped?
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.280]   It had a keyboard.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.760]   It was the first one that had a keyboard.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.120]   It had a keyboard.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.000]   And it was kind of like a device where you could walk--
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.200]   And was running POMO, I said.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.120]   Yeah, it was like a POMPile with a keyboard and CDMA radio.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.360]   He said he wants better screen resolution and a better camera.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   There it is.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.920]   It's funny.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.160]   What looks like a flag now?
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.280]   That's on Sprint.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.600]   Everybody was excited for Verizon VCast.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.760]   I don't even remember that.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.520]   What was that?
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   I think they were going to do streaming TV on the--
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.480]   It was like a media.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.680]   It was some sort of streaming media.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.280]   It was their horrible-- the antenna or the screen
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.360]   would flip out of the phone and be
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.960]   able to watch television over Verizon's network.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   It was correct.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.080]   Robert Herron said, I'm using Nextel.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.680]   Oh, man.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.600]   I don't like the chirps sound when you pushed the talk.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   I missed that push the talk.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.120]   You lived it.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.160]   You pushed the talk.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.960]   That worked really well.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.240]   You know what?
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.200]   They ended up donating that phone to a good cause.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.040]   So it went--
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.400]   It didn't go--
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.080]   You remember it.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.760]   Oh, yes.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.040]   It was the first color display I had on a phone.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.880]   What was the tax write off you took?
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.120]   It took no tax write off on that one.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.640]   10 bucks.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.320]   Nowadays, I tend to save every smartphone I have now.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.680]   It's like for a few generations at least.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.320]   Which leads us into a gazelle chatter.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.880]   I'm just going to check it because--
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.240]   No, I did it too.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.960]   The sad thing is it's accelerated
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   and the flagship phones have accelerated.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.520]   So if your desire is to see what all the flagship
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.040]   phones and how they work are, it's almost impossible
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.960]   to keep up now.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.720]   But isn't it funny 10 years from now we're--
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.240]   Keep it up.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.960]   --and Leo was talking about his--
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.520]   Yeah, like CS6 Edge.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.040]   What a terrible-- that's pretty--
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.640]   This is your favorite thing in the world.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   I am in love with it's my new lover until Friday.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.760]   When my new lover will arrive.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.400]   What is that?
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.360]   With Apple Watch.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.760]   David, you're a watch.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   I remember a long time you were a stolen Tagur.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.120]   I didn't know it wasn't a stolen one.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.640]   It was a fabrication of it.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.600]   It looked like a tag.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.640]   Oh, you said some guy walked up to you on the street
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.160]   and you said you want to buy this for 50 bucks.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.200]   Yeah, I knew it wasn't real.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.400]   No, I bought it for like $10.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.160]   $10.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.440]   No, but I think about what you say think is that--
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.040]   and I don't know how much--
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   it totally applies to Apple watches.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.960]   But I used to think the fact that you could
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.440]   put the equivalent of a car on your arm is pretty dumb.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.000]   I thought, I don't understand why you need something
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.440]   that buys a car to put on your arm.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.880]   But then you start thinking about the mechanics of it
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.440]   and the machining of it and the moving parts.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   And it's a piece of art.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.440]   Are you moving to watch film?
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.720]   I'm not becoming a huge watch guy,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.400]   but I can appreciate and understand
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.320]   how a watch can be a piece of fine art
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   from a mechanical perspective.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.360]   It is far removed from, I think, the discussions
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.200]   around smart watches.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   I agree.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.320]   But the thing is people are trying to compare them.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.280]   That's why like a few weeks ago, Kevin
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.320]   was writing all about the gold edition,
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.800]   why are you paying extra money for 18-karat gold
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.480]   that's worth X.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.880]   And I kind of agree on this.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.800]   That is a douchebag detector.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.880]   Well, because there's one thing that's putting a smart watch
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.520]   that has to keep the business on your arm.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.720]   And then there's one by putting a gold leaf on it.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.520]   Well, it's like we just bought my son this first watch.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.960]   It's a Time X, right?
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.160]   And if it was the Apple Time X--
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.920]   No, no, no, hold on.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.400]   My first watch.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.480]   You think your son needs a watch?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.960]   Yeah, to tell time.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   It's part of a few member.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   I definitely don't have to tell time.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.200]   Do they do the pie face time?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   Do they do analog time?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.520]   It's not even going to the educational aspect of it.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.120]   Because my kids do not know how to tell time with the hands.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.720]   Yes, well--
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.440]   They can't little hand.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.840]   Remember that?
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.120]   They don't know that.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.000]   If my children wake up in 1941 and have
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.760]   to figure out whether or not to get out of the boat,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.080]   they're going to know what time it is.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.520]   You're prepared.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.560]   But I laugh, right?
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.000]   But if you take the $27 Time X watch my son has,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.440]   and you know, a lecture played it,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.280]   it suddenly becomes a $10,000 watch
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.880]   with the same delete explet of $27 innards inside of it.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   Well, wait a minute, though.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.920]   That is not a lecture played it.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.120]   That is a minute to him.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.400]   And Kevin estimated it's about $2,000
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.480]   worth of actual gold.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.120]   It's $2,000 worth of actual gold.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.560]   It's the Ruby-- the only thing I want off that watch
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.440]   is the Ruby crystal, which you can get in the sapphire.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   Sapphire, pardon me.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.600]   But--
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.280]   In theory, I break screens like you open bottles of wine.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.960]   It just happens and it happens constantly.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.840]   So you can't get this--
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.600]   I can't get this for it.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.280]   Yeah, OK.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.200]   Patrick breaks everything.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.240]   It's awesome.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.560]   But it's like--
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.720]   We were thinking of a new show.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.680]   So we're going to announce a new show during the show.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   So we're brainstorming ideas.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.560]   And I got one.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   Chair aerobics with Patrick Norton.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.720]   You sit in a chair, but you have a sledgehammer.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.520]   And you lift it, you move it, you put--
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.440]   I think it'd be a great show.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.520]   Don't we have a video of you with a ball popping underneath you?
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.240]   I think we do.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.000]   You want to see it?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.800]   Let's fire that.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.300]   All right.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.160]   I have the clip here.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.040]   It's a clip number--
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.320]   seven, please, of 33.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.920]   Number seven.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.320]   OK, that's the audio only one.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.720]   This is the original one, right?
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.080]   This is the first time in Pop, but it wasn't on--
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   It wasn't on video.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.920]   Video.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.800]   Game entirely.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.320]   It's the right--
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.760]   This is the old order and getting the right macro set up.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   It's on this.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.840]   Man, as Will Harris is talking--
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.000]   I just had another explosion here.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.840]   My exercise ball popped.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.240]   Too many thumbnails.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.480]   Is that killing over?
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.080]   So people know this by now, but I
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.080]   like to sit on a ball during the shows
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.720]   because it keeps you moving around.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.440]   We used to do the whole show Stand Up.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.720]   But I don't want to do two hours.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.600]   These shows are too long.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.400]   Stand Up.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.720]   And I'm too old, so I sit on a ball.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.920]   And Colleen, who was our chief engineer--
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.280]   we love Colleen Henry.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.400]   She's so great.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.640]   She was our chief engineer at the time.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.680]   She said, Leo, you're buying expensive balls from Gopher's
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.200]   Sport.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.120]   I can get them for you cheaper.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.920]   There's a Chinese company that makes the same ball.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.120]   So we got Chinese balls.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   It's not the same guys they made my fake tag watch.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.760]   A lot of people have said that about you.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.040]   Your fake tag watch is still running.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.440]   And show the video.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.840]   So even after the first one burst, you'd think I'd have learned.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.240]   But we got a second one.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.560]   And now this one had sprung a slow leak.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   And I thought, oh, this'll be funny.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.600]   I'll ride it.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   I'll slowly go down.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.840]   I'll ride it down.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.040]   Mistakenly.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.400]   Doesn't quite work like that.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.000]   Oh, listen to that.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.760]   By the way, notice the great book, Power Shell in Action.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.320]   Oh, dear.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   I was full of skill.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.600]   I punched a hole in my ball.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.760]   This is terrible.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.680]   This is terrible.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.960]   This is so funny.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.720]   I'll slide down.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.040]   I'm sinking.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   Yeah, no.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.600]   The track door opens.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   The funny thing is, if you don't hurt yourself,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.920]   it's actually views on me.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   So it can't stop?
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.160]   Is that one of the Chinese ones?
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.480]   It's your Chinese ball buss.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.960]   I'm not against--
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.800]   Oh, give it to them.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.200]   Give it to them, Roger.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.680]   Don't put up with that.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.320]   Don't look at me.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.520]   It's not much.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.680]   No, the chat room is very useful.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.800]   Let them write the jokes and we'll--
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.680]   Yeah, this show is going to go lewd.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.880]   I'm absolutely sure of it.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.360]   No, no, no.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.160]   Because you're going to keep us on the straight line.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.000]   Oh, yeah, that's what I'll do.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.560]   Anyway, buy Go4Sport anti-burst ultra-fit stability balls.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   And they never pop.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   They never pop.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.040]   We have a rack of them.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.160]   We thought when we first built the studio,
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.600]   we would make our audience sit on balls.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.360]   I remember walking in here and being like, why
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.760]   did they have 30 exercise balls?
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.120]   Oh, these balls.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.240]   There was a rack for them.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.480]   Yeah, and there still is.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.960]   Well, maybe we've taken it down by now.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.680]   But we had a rack.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.880]   And like 30 balls because we thought that would be more.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.920]   And frankly, those of you sitting in the metal chairs,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.480]   probably wishing right now you had some balls.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.320]   Because those--
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.840]   Especially those guys from Canada.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.120]   No.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.240]   Wow, that fell flat.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.440]   Wow, that was great.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.040]   No, we do have uncomfortable.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.440]   We've gotten more comfortable chairs.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.680]   We actually went out and got some fancy chairs.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.800]   So I guess today we'll do some news.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.240]   But there's stuff to talk about.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.640]   Just as since we were on the watch, somebody already said,
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.160]   oh, thank god, they're not going to talk about the Apple
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:37.920]   watch today.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.120]   Yes, of course we are.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.200]   Because that's all you talk about.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.360]   That's all there is to talk about.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.320]   I have to tell you, this is an outrageously great phone.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.360]   Five minutes with it, and he's already excited about it.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.200]   It's gorgeous.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.520]   It's 577 dots per inch, which is a little--
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.760]   We're talking about the Galaxy S6, and this is the edge.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.160]   He's been raving about it for weeks.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.760]   He's actually used the edge if you found the edge to be useful.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.200]   No, there's nothing for the edges of the edge.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.400]   What is the edge part?
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.720]   Well, there is a little bit--
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.120]   There's a super ammo bar that wraps around the edge.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.520]   So you can see the side of your phone
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.320]   and you're laying down in your bed and looking at--
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.200]   There's a special gesture.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.240]   You rub it like a genie's lamp.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.160]   And then it shows--
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   It's like something else can be controlled.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.760]   You can see it.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.520]   Where's the camera?
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.200]   There it is.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.840]   You could see the time, the date.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.000]   And then I can scroll that, and I can get nothing new.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Fantastic.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   Or you can just look at your watch.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.040]   Well, I'm thinking the watch is going to be a better--
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.560]   It's supposed to show.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.000]   I thought it was supposed to show up there.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.840]   Well, that was the problem I had with the Note 4 Edge,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.120]   which was actually upside down.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.680]   This one finally flips around.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.320]   So there you go.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.120]   And when you can assign colors to people.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.040]   So if you're--
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.920]   But see, who leaves their phone face down?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.640]   That's a bad idea.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.440]   But if you leave your phone face down,
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.160]   it will glow with the color of the person that's texted you
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.760]   or called you to be.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.840]   On the back or on the side?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.240]   No, the edge glows.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.520]   So you get a little purple glow coming out of the bottom.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.560]   If you're laying in bed, totally useless.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.640]   Keep the lights from--
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.480]   Totally useless.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.280]   That's my favorite phone though right now.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.080]   You like it?
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.600]   Beautiful.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.480]   It just feels good in the hand and the screen is--
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.440]   Do you mind the glow on the edges for the curve,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.000]   parts of the glass, picking up light in the room?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.240]   Well, you know, it's a little weird.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   Yeah, somebody's complained about that and you do see that.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.200]   Seems minor just for the feel of those corners or those edges.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.320]   Yeah, and a lot of people are saying,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.000]   don't spend 100 extra bucks to get the curve.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.800]   Just get a normal one.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.960]   I like Mr. Green in the chair room.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.800]   That's a gimmick if I ever see that.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.160]   It is absolutely a gimmick.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.800]   But remember, I'm the guy who paid 100 bucks
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.120]   for a black painted MacBook.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.040]   That was 100 bucks extra.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.600]   Remember, it's for black paint.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.120]   So imagine you put 18-karat gold on your eye watch.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.840]   I mean, on your watch, sorry.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.000]   I would spray it with gold paint.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.840]   So are you getting an Apple watch?
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.720]   I'm not.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.400]   I'm not because I totally don't believe in it.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.680]   But right now, the only reason I can see to get one
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.240]   is that some of the beta testers say
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.040]   that if they pull out their phone 100 times a day,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.680]   they'll now only pull it out about 20 times a day.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.520]   And the rest of the time, they'll look at their watch
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.080]   and spend less time so they have more time
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.160]   to not be staring at it.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.200]   If that really holds true--
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   I really do pull my phone down--
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.040]   Am I worth that?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.880]   Maybe worth it.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.640]   Maybe it would be worth it because I get the input
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.520]   and then carry on.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.200]   However, I feel like I'll probably have 500 interactions
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   instead of 100.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.960]   And maybe it'll be just--
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   You'll use it more.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.480]   It'll work.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.600]   But I kind of want to wait.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.880]   I'm usually an early adopter.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.720]   I want to wait and see what the jury of hundreds of--
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.120]   not millions of people have to say.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.000]   And then maybe I'll consider it.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.160]   That's surprisingly intelligent.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.240]   What about having to charge it every 18 hours?
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:19.760]   So what?
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.360]   Don't you charge your phone every day?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.080]   Not necessarily.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.520]   I get home.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.200]   I get in bed.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.280]   I put my phone on the charger.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.320]   I'll put my watch on the charger.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.240]   Do that with a Moto 360 already.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.080]   My Moto Folde group--
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.920]   No, go two days straight.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   --is straight.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.000]   --is one of these things.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.840]   You--
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.360]   A million--
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   The analysts say--
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.280]   After 100 million.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.040]   Analysts say there were one--
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.400]   I know-- of course, analysts are guessing.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.280]   It's a wild-ass guess.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.080]   But the guess that I don't know how well-founded it is
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.720]   is about a million pre-orders.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.800]   Right.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.120]   That's got to be, though, almost all the people
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.520]   were going to get one, at least initially.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.720]   There's a study that said that--
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.360]   and I think the study was done the same way
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.840]   as they do exit polls, where they said,
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.960]   how much did you spend on your order?
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   It was over $700.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.920]   And I feel like those are clearly the early adopters
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.640]   and of the sample that they got to respond
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.760]   to the equivalent of that exit poll,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.120]   are the ones that are spending more.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.640]   I think it's less, but it's that expensive.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.360]   It's a billion-dollar business already.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.880]   Do you really want to spend $450 to $500 on a watch
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.120]   that has a marketplace that's not quite defined yet?
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.880]   It is a testament to Apple and their amazing ability
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.280]   to market because it's completely unknown
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.320]   whether this watch is going to work,
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.840]   is it going to do what you want it to do?
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.960]   Is it going to be of any value?
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.680]   Is it battery life?
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.160]   It's amazing.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.000]   We don't know.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.880]   I mean, everything I've seen even though they're catering
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.360]   the message, and all they do is talk about the aluminium,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.400]   among other things.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.360]   But they put so much work and research
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.400]   and the ways--
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   no, of course, they're tailoring the way they present it.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.320]   But darn thing is incredible.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:41.760]   I think--
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.560]   That's why you seem like you should be buying one.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.840]   I just don't know if it's going to get one.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.480]   And he hands my life the right way.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.000]   Get one.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.600]   Buy it.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   Buy it.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.280]   Buy it, Prager.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.000]   I have too much ADD.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.560]   Me too.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.480]   And sell it after you buy it.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.800]   Sell it in your Tesla, right?
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.520]   Yep.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.040]   Why?
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.240]   Because I don't drive, and I live in the city,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.160]   and I have no commute almost.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   And it's starting to depreciate a tech product.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   Oh, no.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   Well, it meaning the first gen.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.640]   I had the 360th one, which in a way is kind of neat.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.560]   But now, mine doesn't have as many sensors
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.240]   of all the new ones.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   And finally, there's a reason for that car
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.760]   to depreciate and value.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.440]   That specific one, I think the Tesla's Model S--
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.200]   I give you a 30 degrees.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.680]   --which are the most amazing--
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.400]   Cash.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.120]   --another amazing feat of engineering.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.080]   But I have no reason to keep--
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.360]   I probably want to get another one,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.200]   but I might as well wait six or eight months
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.440]   and save that $15 to $20,000 in depreciation.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.160]   Not a bad idea, but I think we should get back
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.360]   to talking about the watch.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.880]   No.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.880]   Yeah, I'm at the whole show about the watch.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.360]   Believe me.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:33.960]   Or a phone.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.040]   The phone is a good topic.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.000]   We'll be about the watch.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   Next week will be about--
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.760]   I'm actually going to be down at IFixit
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.880]   watching them do the teardown of all this.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.840]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.840]   That should be highly amusing.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.360]   Back to the watch.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.680]   Where are they getting there's--
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.880]   What is this for you, John?
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.360]   Where are they getting there's front of the watch, please?
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.280]   You know, I didn't ask.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.880]   But they think they'll have one on the 24th.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.520]   I was told they will have like three.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.800]   That was one of the stories this week was that Apple don't even
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.960]   try to buy one of an Apple store.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.760]   I thought that was interesting because, you know,
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.240]   errands like we're shutting it down indefinitely.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.320]   I hope everybody ordered one.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.680]   We'll start selling them the stores in June.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.480]   Ish.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.360]   There is a real, I think, a genuine risk
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.440]   that the watch will come out.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.960]   And after the first blush, people will go, you know what?
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.800]   It's no.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.480]   You say about every new Apple product.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   Yep.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.920]   You're an anti-Apple bigot.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.800]   No, it's a fact.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.000]   I'm not joking.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.480]   You know it.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.080]   I know it.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.880]   Patrick knows it.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.760]   Everybody's sitting here.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, we get a record of applause
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.920]   for the best troll I have ever known, John C. Devorah.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.960]   But I don't usually boy these out, but that was so well done.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.120]   A bigot is somebody who decides not on the basis of fact,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.200]   but just because I hate those guys.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.880]   I'm not a bigot.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.360]   So you're actually a bigot.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.120]   I love Apple.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.480]   Are you kidding?
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.120]   I was one of the rainbow guys.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.160]   And I bought a Mac on the first 300 days.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.080]   And do you remember when you bought the G4C?
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.920]   Talking about the pack.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.000]   Today it was canceled.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.800]   You're talking about the pack.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.040]   I have bought every iPhone.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.720]   I kicked out of the Apple events.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.560]   You've been this way.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.320]   OK, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.160]   People think that.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.400]   And why would I care?
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.480]   By the way, you want to see what happened on the Apple event?
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.880]   I think we have the video.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.360]   This goes back to 2010.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.560]   Apple wasn't streaming these events.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.880]   So there was no way that you as a normal person could
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.520]   see what was going on.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.360]   I was lucky enough to get an invitation
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.440]   to go see the event.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   And you know what?
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.040]   One of the things I'm very grateful is I did get to see
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.200]   Steve Jobs introduce the iPhone, introduce the iPad.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.800]   You were watching a master at work.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.000]   And I was so excited about it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.160]   I knew people were very excited.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   We had several-- literally, several 100,000 people
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.160]   watching the live stream.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.200]   We were-- because Apple wasn't streaming it.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.240]   And they're talking to me my ear because I am on phone
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.200]   communication with the studio.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.880]   And I thought, oh, what the hell?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.000]   I opened up the laptop.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.920]   And this is what happened.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.920]   Apple's own video has a picture of me in the audience.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.240]   And I don't know if you can really tell.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.200]   But the way I'm-- and see, it's gone full screen.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.440]   So you can see that, in fact, what I am doing
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.920]   is holding up my laptop and taking a picture of the speech.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.360]   And you can see that that's what's going on.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.040]   In fact, Steve Jobs, a couple of times, looked over at me
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.320]   and kind of gave me this stink eye.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   And I realized now that's because he saw himself on the screen.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.760]   I'm holding up a screen with his picture on it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.520]   My video--
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.520]   I was streaming--
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   I was streaming.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:13.800]   And it's not--
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.280]   There was the only way you could watch it.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:15.800]   That's funny.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.480]   That was your pair scope of the day.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.000]   I think I have to.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.560]   If I'd had Meerkat or Periscope imagine, in fact,
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:26.400]   at the last Apple event, everybody Meerkat did it, right?
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.800]   Or was it an Apple event?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.400]   What was the last big event?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.040]   I'm blanking.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.000]   But it was in January--
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.120]   So let's do the following.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.920]   What happened after this happened?
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.880]   It was the watch event.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.800]   You were a viable--
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.280]   No, I'm talking about it.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.440]   After you violated the rules--
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:38.920]   Nothing.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.960]   Absolutely nothing.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.480]   Nobody ever got invited to anything again.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.800]   Well, I don't know if they're even tied together.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.440]   Nobody came over and said anything.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.000]   Go inside.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.160]   I never got a call.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.240]   I never heard from Apple.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.600]   But I didn't get invited ever again.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.040]   But you know what?
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.360]   That's not a big deal because Apple streams them.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.480]   I wouldn't go even if I got invited at this point
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   because I need to be--
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.280]   No, I wouldn't.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.920]   Because I can't cover it from there.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.720]   I can cover it from there.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.280]   I can cover it from there.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.120]   And frankly, I was glad to go because it was Steve Jobs
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.840]   to watch this amazing fellow at work.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.640]   But at this point, I'd watch and Tim Cook at work.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.800]   It's like watching paint drying.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.320]   It's nice.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   But it's--
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.680]   Oh, that's going to get in a good graces.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.200]   I'm not trying to get many--
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   No, thanks.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.240]   What do I care?
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.320]   Tim's doing-- Tim had the worst job ever, which
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.960]   is to follow up Steve Jobs presentations, which were--
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   I mean, the most amazing--
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.320]   I think press event ever saw was when
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.920]   they announced the Intel processors.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.680]   Because they--
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.320]   Oh, man, I hated that.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.120]   --such a good job.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.200]   It did such an amazing job of basically
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.640]   lying to the entire Apple community
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.080]   for years about the performance of the processor, which
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.640]   was incredibly far behind until at that point.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.140]   You know?
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.140]   I think it's only--
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.140]   --the same.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.140]   --it comes out.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.140]   It's like we're proud to announce we're putting the Intel-- not
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.740]   that Steve Jobs talk like that.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.220]   And the entire room sounded like everybody
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.220]   had been gut puns.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   It was just like, oh.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.060]   Yeah, Paul and the room was a silo from like--
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.660]   --in 30 seconds.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.100]   No, well, but there's a similar moment.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.340]   Remember when Steve came back to Apple
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.180]   and his first Macworld Expo keynote?
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.700]   A big giant Bill Gates shows up on the screen,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.940]   like 800 feet tall.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.300]   I mean, it was after the first--
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   I think it was the second one.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.860]   I don't think it was right off the top.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.140]   Well, it was because Apple was in dire straits.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.140]   They were running out of money.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.300]   They were literally three months from going bankrupt.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.580]   We've learned.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.140]   And Bill said, I'll give you $150 million
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.060]   and promised to continue to do office for the Macintosh.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.780]   And of course, you know why, because Bill saw a DOJ investigation
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.220]   down the road, and he needed to say, hey, we're not a monopolist.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.900]   I am wondering about your timeline.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.260]   But OK, I know this happened, but I don't know if the time is--
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.780]   Who cares?
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.460]   Does it matter?
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.260]   I think this was after the DOJ thing already happened.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.020]   Do you have video of that?
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.540]   There he is.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.460]   Can you imagine the Apple faithful who, for years,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.420]   said Microsoft is the evil empire?
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.180]   They booed him.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.220]   It sounds like they're cheering.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.100]   They're booing.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.980]   Good filtering.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.940]   Look at that.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.420]   Look at that.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.180]   Not happy.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.100]   Boeing him in the chat room.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.460]   Does he look happy?
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.020]   He is happy.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.100]   He looks snarky.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.820]   But you know what?
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.660]   It was a lifesaver.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.420]   He threw Apple a lifesaver.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.620]   I don't think they would have continued without that money.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.940]   I was on the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.300]   I said, thank you Bill Gates.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.380]   Steve Jobs in the corner.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.780]   Bill Gates in the corner.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.260]   It was a weird moment.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.900]   And it was-- I think that was one of those moments where Steve Jobs
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900]   learned a big lesson.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.980]   You don't have some giant head.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.740]   The odds, the head of odds on the screen.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.300]   Well, it had a certain sort of--
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.460]   just like the 1984 commercial.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:26.980]   It was.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.940]   Except that Steve wasn't--
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.380]   Maybe that was--
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:28.420]   Maybe that was--
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:28.940]   Maybe that was--
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.780]   Maybe that was the--
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.340]   Right, maybe that was the--
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.380]   So were you the first person to livestream an Apple event?
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.380]   That was the last person.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.380]   I think he was.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.060]   And that kick started probably Apple thinking about doing that
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.060]   themselves.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.420]   Well, they should have been thinking about it all the long.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.780]   But I think it was-- the whole thing was a PR attempt.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.020]   Because I mean, they could have livestreamed it any time
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.500]   they wanted.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.380]   They stopped because they thought the hype built around everyone
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.300]   talking about it.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.860]   And even like all the live blogging that was going on,
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.700]   I mean, it had to be the strategy.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.900]   I don't know if the strategy worked.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.020]   But that's clearly why.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.660]   Because everyone would have watched it.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.940]   But maybe the hype was even more if everyone couldn't.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.900]   And I think since then, maybe they've come back.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.660]   I can't think of any other explanation.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.300]   There's an area of exclusivity when certain people get to see
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.580]   things and then tell you--
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   Right, I think you're right.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.300]   And then you add a certain prestige to whatever product.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   Now that they're streaming it, now people can look at it
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.020]   and then live tweet or blog.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.500]   Yeah, they weren't objecting to live blogging.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.300]   Well, now they realize that having a bunch of people
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.780]   all singing your praises instead of a couple of selected
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.580]   few doing it is a lot more advantageous
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.700]   to get the word out, right?
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.500]   Don't you think, too, when you watch one of those events
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.700]   that initially, it's very hard for me to control my enthusiasm?
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.100]   Like, I don't care what they show me.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.900]   They're like, a gold plated crap.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.420]   And it's very hard because they sell it so well.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.740]   You're going to buy one of those.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.580]   Everybody, the techno-- he said hashtag techno lust.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.660]   They're very good at that.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.900]   Aren't they ripping that off from Darren?
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.460]   Technolust?
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.660]   Yeah, well, go ahead and sue him, Darren.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.380]   I don't know.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.940]   I've always been pretty immune to the Apple.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.740]   You don't get excited.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.700]   You look at those and say, I've got to get that thing.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.220]   No.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.740]   But I mean, you also found out you were pregnant.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.500]   Oh, cool.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.140]   Well, I'm not pregnant, but--
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.300]   I thought you were your wife's.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.580]   Congratulations.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.220]   Thank you very much.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.140]   How old is your baby?
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.300]   Two and a half months.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:15.940]   Boy, girl.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.500]   Girl.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.220]   What's your name?
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.060]   Eloise.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.900]   Eloise for short.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.020]   And do you have a wife?
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.060]   Yes.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.700]   You can't--
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.700]   Whoa.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.060]   You were the last man that was just trashy.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.060]   You've been Apple Evacro.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.460]   I thought you were the first man to have a baby without a woman.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.500]   This is a big episode.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.660]   What's your wife's name?
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.220]   Jennifer.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.100]   Jennifer, that's so great.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.220]   Is she from Australia?
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.820]   No, she's from New Jersey.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.020]   Which is an Australia coming into the picture?
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.020]   That's an in-joke.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.660]   There you go.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.460]   You used to be trips to Australia way back in the day.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.700]   There's two.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.220]   It's trips?
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.380]   Or Roger, when back in the tech TV days,
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.540]   his girlfriend lived 8,000 miles away.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.300]   In Australia.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.980]   Kind of hard to have a relationship.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.260]   She was a nice woman.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:56.820]   Oh, she was great.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.820]   Loved her.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.140]   She had to literally mail it in.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.660]   Anyway, congratulations.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.140]   Thank you very much.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.300]   Really, really great.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.500]   And David, did you get married or anything?
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.940]   Any life events?
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.500]   Not married.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.460]   I have an amazing girlfriend.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.980]   And everything is amazing and fantastic.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.660]   What are you doing?
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:15.860]   Because--
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.660]   It'll get to somewhere.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.540]   You were--
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.380]   A big part of revision three.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.700]   Frankly, I don't know if people know this.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.500]   But Kevin and you started it.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.380]   You really made--
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.420]   With Jay, you can't discount Jay.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.820]   Jay, he was the first guy through any money at it.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.540]   He was the catalyst.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.700]   He was like, if you guys do this full time,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.180]   I will give you $50,000.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.860]   And we didn't like working for Comcast.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.540]   We thought, all right, let's--
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.500]   You were still--
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.460]   In LA, we're doing the G4 tech TV.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.660]   Was it still as screensavers?
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.700]   Or had it been renamed to Tech of the Show when you were there?
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.420]   It was in process of changing.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.580]   I think they've already decided to change the name.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.860]   We're coming up with a relaunch and rebranding strategy
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.940]   for the show.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.860]   Kevin had the idea for Dig, which I
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.260]   think he started when you were still host and pretended
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.060]   that he didn't know about it.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.220]   Like, hey, look at this cool idea.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.140]   It's this website effort.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.660]   Yeah, actually.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.460]   That was a little--
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:28:59.980]   Did it come out?
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.260]   I can't get the idea for it, but I don't think he
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.420]   launched it till you guys were doing LA.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.260]   Because I think Dig was sordid before revision three,
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.340]   but revision three took off faster.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.020]   And then revision three kind of waned before we really
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.540]   got our funding.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.180]   And Dig was going this way.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.100]   And all the focus shifted to Dig.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.420]   And the only reason I can really take any credit
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.620]   for revision three, aside from being technically employee one,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.460]   I wasn't there on the day zero.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.220]   I was there on day 10 is because everyone shifted over to Dig.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.140]   Like, hey, here's this hot internet startup.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.700]   I'm like, I don't want to do that.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.620]   I want to do revision three.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.060]   So I ran it for a year and a half on my own.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.260]   You deserve a lot of credit.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.940]   You made that thing happen.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.440]   Thanks.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.540]   And I know people know this.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.980]   A lot of pieces fell into place.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.460]   I worked hard, and I feel proud of what I did.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.940]   And that's just one of the opportunities I was given.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.700]   And I was luckily in the right place in frame of mind
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.300]   to be able to manage it and take advantage of it
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.820]   and have the right ideas for solutions.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.900]   On episode one, 10 years ago of Twit, Kevin talked about Dig.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.420]   He spent all his nights and weekends
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.420]   working on it, adding new features,
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.500]   like adding friends and RSS feeds for friends.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.420]   So he was very much involved in Dig.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.060]   And I remember it was only a few episodes into Twit
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.460]   that he announced, I think I'm going to leave G4
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.740]   and pursue this because I really want to do this.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.140]   So you left with him.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.980]   No, I left honestly, like maybe within a month.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.140]   And that was when they were--
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.980]   You left for me, you said I'm happy.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.620]   I left for people to help monetize revision 3.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.660]   I'm a TV producer by trade in my background.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.420]   And I thought, luckily I wasn't a sales guy maybe
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.340]   because I didn't understand.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.620]   There were no ad units.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.940]   There was no ways to count views.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.260]   And luckily, since I didn't come from a traditional sales
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.980]   background, I didn't have rules to think about it.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.980]   I was able to make them up.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.380]   And making them up was like, who's our audience
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.660]   and what kind of companies can we
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.300]   try to do things for and move the needle for?
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.420]   And that was all CPA, cost per action,
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.100]   even though everyone wanted branding campaigns.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.900]   And so making up ideas and trying it,
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.500]   if you have some semblance of an audience,
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.900]   you can try things and throw darts and see what works
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.460]   and build for now.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.300]   What was the first revision 3 show?
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.380]   Was it System?
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.100]   It was System.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.740]   It was kind of a hybrid version of the broken
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.540]   and I guess the newer version of System.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.860]   It was like one episode of the broken.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.620]   Then there were two or three episodes of the system.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.340]   The indignation started.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.780]   Then you brought me on to work with David to do--
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.500]   To basically--
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.140]   To give it a Randolph.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.860]   A Randolph to do System regularly.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.860]   And then the funding came that summer.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.220]   Worst thing that ever happened to you guys
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.060]   was getting funded by the--
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.900]   In 2006?
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.340]   I mean, if we didn't get it, it wouldn't work out.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.700]   It wouldn't have happened.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.540]   Here's some video from System.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.300]   This is Track 6, Jason.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.700]   Kevin, and I think you two, David, came to visit.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.780]   And this was when I was working in the smallest room
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.420]   of the cottage.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:32.980]   We hit it.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.540]   We're a few months into--
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.940]   How to podcast?
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.940]   How to podcast.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:42.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.100]   I'm here behind the scenes at Twitch.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.660]   This week in tech with host Leo LaPortz.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.620]   Leo, this has to be the most complicated setup
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.860]   I've ever seen in my entire life.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.100]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.940]   This is just kind of grown in a bad way.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.420]   This is actually-- we just completed our last time
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.940]   that we're going to do it here in the little mini
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.460]   Twitter off it.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.980]   My Garrett off it.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.820]   We're in the attic of an old bed and breakfast
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.940]   Victorian building.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.180]   And I do the KFI radio show from here.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.180]   And that's how we started with Twitch.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.380]   We didn't have a lot of equipment
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.260]   when we first started doing it.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.180]   In fact, to do the radio show, all I really need is--
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.300]   and all I really had to begin with is this headset mic.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.340]   This is a good one.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.580]   It's been about 500 bucks for these.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.340]   This is a Sennheiser HMD 20.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.260]   This is the best.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.980]   And then I used this.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.180]   This is an ISDN.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:20.940]   I've got rid of those.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.900]   Kodak, they call it.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.700]   This is the Zephyr for I.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.700]   You get the--
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.340]   You can actually--
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:24.820]   --pmd.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.220]   This is a--
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.340]   --available on YouTube, if you want.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.580]   --to watch the whole thing.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.580]   --the whole thing.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.740]   --or it's a records onto a compact watch.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.460]   But that was where we started.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.820]   And do you guys ever remember doing a show
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.940]   we were all sitting on the floor in that room?
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.260]   Is that-- bring the bell?
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.740]   I offered sat on the floor.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.940]   It was pretty bad.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.620]   And it would be like during the hot summer months.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.300]   It was horrible.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.020]   It was so hot up there.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:45.620]   It was terrible.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.980]   Analog was all analog.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.180]   Do you remember the bathroom having the slanted roof in it
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.220]   so you would always hit your head?
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.580]   And a cloth foot tub, though.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.060]   Yes.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.580]   Remember that?
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.500]   Did you guys ever take a bath when you--
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.540]   You know I never occurred to me.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.740]   Never.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.260]   Never occurred.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.980]   We're going to take a break.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.580]   You could see immediately, though, as we've been sitting here.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.940]   It's like-- it never ended, right?
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.980]   It's just you guys immediately--
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.340]   we have this bond, this rapport.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.100]   It never ended, what never ended?
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   Twit.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:12.740]   Of course not.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.180]   You do the show every Sunday.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.060]   You still do that?
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.900]   Our 10th anniversary show continues in just a little bit.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.420]   We actually have a new sponsor.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.340]   You guys use Dropbox.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.260]   You know about Dropbox, right?
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.540]   Everybody knows about Dropbox.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.780]   Everybody uses Dropbox.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.100]   Dropbox is available for business.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.860]   And if you have been using Dropbox--
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.060]   I think one of the reasons we started using Dropbox for business
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.060]   is because we had all these Dropbox accounts.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.860]   Everybody was using their own personal account, right?
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.380]   So Dropbox for business lets you use Dropbox
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.740]   to the same Dropbox you're familiar with,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.860]   but designed to work better for business.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.460]   In fact, 4 million businesses now use Dropbox for business.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.620]   You can manage the accounts.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.100]   You can manage billing.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.460]   You've got control of your data.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.580]   And of course, you've got a lot more space.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.580]   Simple storage and sharing for any kind of file on any platform.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.180]   Each user starts off with a terabyte, starts off with a terabyte,
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.140]   and then you can expand it easily.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.180]   Very affordable.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.340]   Staff could collaborate with team members.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.420]   You could securely invite and control access
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.980]   to outside partners, clients, and vendors.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.820]   And really, the thing that is the most difference
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.180]   for Dropbox for business is control.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.740]   And your IT department will like that.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.940]   You'll like that for business.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.860]   You've got powerful admin controls, remote wipe,
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.020]   intuitive sharing permission controls, complete audit logs.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.940]   You know exactly who's got access to sensitive company data,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.740]   who doesn't, how you can control that.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.260]   It integrates beautifully with third party security
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.060]   and administration solutions, SIEMDLPE discovery.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.220]   And it uses encryption, of course, for data in transit
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.580]   and at rest, segmentation and hashing
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.300]   too to anonymize files.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   Extra security features are available like single sign-on,
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   two-step verification.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.900]   It is-- well, you already know Dropbox.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.260]   It's Dropbox, but better.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.900]   Dropbox for business.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.860]   Take advantage of your employees familiarity
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.460]   with Dropbox and sign up today.

[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.820]   Thank you so much, Dropbox.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.220]   I'm really thrilled to have them a part of our Twit family.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.020]   You know, it's funny about the advertisers,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.060]   because we really try to use advertisers we use.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.180]   Because then I can talk about it.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.220]   And I've been trying to get Dropbox to advertise on Twit
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.980]   for probably five years.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.020]   So thrilled to have you.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.860]   Can you get us some com extra space?
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.900]   You want an extra space?
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.340]   Pick up your microphone first.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.860]   All right, John, seek to 4-act.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.500]   Extra space.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.420]   I need extra space.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.220]   John, seek to 4-act needs space.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.900]   They give you a terabyte with a record count.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.260]   Terabyte.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.580]   I know.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.820]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.740]   Cloud has changed so much.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.580]   I'm just using the free thing.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.100]   Let me get you three gigs.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.740]   Let me ask you, John.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.220]   I get no storage.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.660]   Because you've always been really negative on cloud storage.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.540]   You say it's a return to the old days.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.180]   Client server computing big computer.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.260]   Yeah, I said that.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.060]   Thin's client and stuff like that.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.660]   Have you changed your tune a little bit on that?
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.420]   No.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.540]   God, I love cloud.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.500]   Not good.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.220]   The Chromebook is amazing because I just--
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.620]   I sign into the new Chromebook.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.580]   What if Google takes a dislike to you
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.780]   and decides to kick you out and kill your account?
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:14.980]   Well, that would be a bad thing.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.620]   Yeah, so if he was secondary, defensive,
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.780]   he'd run a private email server for sure.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.580]   Absolutely.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.420]   Would you?
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:20.420]   You want--
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.460]   In the basement?
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.380]   Yeah, off a laptop.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.060]   That way you always have it with me.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.940]   I just-- I feel like the cloud is such a revolution.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.580]   I don't know.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.420]   It's a double-edged sword.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.900]   There's a theoretical problem, but it hasn't happened.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.380]   Well, I think it probably has.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.780]   There's plenty of people there on the various Yahoo groups
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.860]   at Bitch and Moan about their whole account being pulled out
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.180]   from under him and they had to host the group stuff.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.700]   Well, for one thing--
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.620]   That's cloud.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.740]   Don't just be tied to one source.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.620]   Well, if you're in Yahoo groups
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.740]   and you're doing something for a Neopold or some groups--
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.380]   This is an old--
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.820]   These stories come and go.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.220]   Yes, Yahoo groups.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.300]   Is that what you're worried about?
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.020]   I'm not worried about it because I don't use these services.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.780]   I like the cloud.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.860]   What do you think?
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.940]   I was having a conversation about this a couple weeks ago,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.220]   and I remember when I first started
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.180]   working at Windows Sources, then later on PC Magazine,
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.940]   how there was this big like--
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.220]   We're taking control back to the servers, which--
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.420]   That I don't like.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.340]   Java machine.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.420]   Remember Java machines?
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.740]   Those were big for 20, 30 minutes.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.980]   You could really ruin your career in being a sys admin
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.900]   by moving everybody onto these boxes.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.860]   But this time, it actually is useful and works.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   But also, I also don't-- there's a lot of stuff
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.820]   I don't want in the cloud.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.020]   I don't want to have to deal with stuff not streaming
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.860]   or stuff not playing.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.500]   But like Crash Plan?
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.780]   Love Crash Plan.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.340]   Because me and half of my family live in places
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.940]   that might get wiped off the face of the map
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.420]   due to some sort of natural disaster.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.620]   It's not like you put all your eggs in that basket,
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.060]   but that's a second basket that you can have.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.780]   So if your original basket breaks a hole in it
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.180]   and the eggs fall out, you have eggs somewhere else.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.300]   How many people basically have their entire life
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.620]   or professional life on Google?
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.500]   Everybody works for Twitch.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.980]   Raise your hands.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.700]   Yeah, we use Google.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.060]   We use Google for work.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.580]   But it's amazing.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.540]   You probably don't.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.300]   You might.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:09.700]   Hybrid.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.700]   I think the two main reasons for cloud, in my mind,
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.860]   are work collaboration and more automated, seamless backup.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.220]   And then the biggest problems are hacking
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.580]   and the fact that you're connected in more places
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.100]   can connect to your data independent of you.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.100]   And then not trusting a large company with your privacy.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.940]   Or, yeah, with your privacy.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.140]   Or them deciding that you violated some term and taking it away.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.980]   That's why, like, for somebody's never, since I used eBay
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.300]   a million years ago for the first time,
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.620]   I would never, ever, ever, ever leave money on PayPal.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.420]   Because you always like, my PayPal account got frozen.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.860]   I'm like, never leave money on PayPal, ever.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.900]   And that-- I mean, and your data on the cloud
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.780]   is slightly less than--
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.180]   How much do we have in our PayPal account right now?
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.380]   Get it out.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:51.900]   Bullet.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.400]   Bullet.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.460]   After-- but we've been using PayPal for donations
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.980]   for 10 years, they don't close accounts after a while.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.420]   They get to know you.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:58.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.740]   But I mean, I still--
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.500]   So you think, if you look like a fly by night,
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.980]   you drain your account every midnight every night.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.380]   I know people who buy the account.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.020]   I mean, I--
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.940]   I think they could buy you.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.180]   The first time I ever got money deposited into my account,
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.460]   it was a return on a ski house share.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.980]   It was a couple thousand dollars, and they locked my account down.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.380]   And they were like, OK.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:15.940]   And there's no--
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.780]   This is old news.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.620]   That's a long time ago.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.300]   Except that sometimes it doesn't really change.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.460]   Because if you-- some of the companies
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.300]   are great if you dial 1-800.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.180]   Or try to work with them.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.700]   And sometimes, they're still an absolute void
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.380]   when you try to deal with any customer service
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.220]   or have a problem.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.100]   I think part of the problem-- and this is somewhat unqualified,
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.180]   so I don't want to get in too much trouble for really pitching
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.060]   on eBay too much.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.740]   But when you're doing sales of personal things online
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.180]   with people you don't know, fraud is really high up.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.260]   Oh, we got ripped off.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.620]   And so when there's that much fraud,
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.820]   companies like PayPal have obviously been owned by eBay forever.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.380]   They have to have all these checks and balances
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.900]   on being able to lock money up and possibly return it
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.700]   or you have it.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.940]   I think part of the problem is you have to put a lot of trust
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.980]   in that corporate entity that holds your stuff in the cloud.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.740]   Well, you trust your bank.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.980]   But at the same time, I don't know.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.340]   Do you now?
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.340]   Oh, John.
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.020]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.460]   John, I forgot, has gold buried in the backyard.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:11.540]   He's all big.
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.540]   He's all out storage, though.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.780]   I have to actually encrypt anything that I find really
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.060]   important before I upload it.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:16.660]   That's fine.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.700]   I use Crash Plan 2.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.580]   I encrypt everything I don't want anyone to see.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.020]   So we-- I don't know.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.100]   You might even have some pictures in the early days of the studio.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.980]   We used Canon XL1 cameras.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.620]   There were-- good in their day.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.300]   We've gotten so much better now.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.100]   But I wanted to think I wanted a third.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.420]   I had two, and I think I wanted a third,
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.300]   and I bought one in eBay.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.300]   Four, I can't remember.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.820]   It was a lot of money, $7,000.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.540]   I thought you got a bunch of them donated.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.020]   Or I thought.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.900]   I remember being jealous that you had all of these Canon
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.220]   cameras that no one would want now.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.580]   Old Canon cameras.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.180]   I don't know what we're looking at here.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:48.580]   There it is.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.820]   From the cottage, yeah.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.220]   So I bought one, I thought, on eBay.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.940]   Oh, Thursday.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:53.420]   Hey.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.620]   There's Roger Chang and Tom Merritt.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.460]   What show do-- oh, that's probably East Meets West.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:57.980]   It's West.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.620]   Whatever happened to that show?
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.100]   Do you still do that?
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:00.900]   What's the most?
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.260]   Love that show.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.340]   Except I can't say it.
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.580]   I always say, "Eats Meets Wet."
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.100]   It could be a great food show.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   Eats Meets Wet.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.420]   It would be a great show for drinking--
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:13.860]   It's also--
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.580]   Did I mention we're going to announce a new show later?
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.660]   Don't say you don't like it.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.020]   No, the name also reminds me of something else
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.460]   I won't go in there.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.940]   Anyway, we bought online--
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.180]   At least one guy, I guess.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:24.700]   I got it.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.500]   An XL1 camera.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   And it never came.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.940]   And the guy said, "No, I shared it to you.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.220]   You must have missed--" you know.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.580]   When Mon finally got--
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.420]   I did get a refund.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.860]   I mean, PayPal will refund your money
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.380]   if you go through the process.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.700]   But yeah, I never, ever got bought an expensive item
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.980]   on eBay again.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.460]   It's one reason why I don't allow--
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.300]   any company that allows you to automate your bill paying,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.580]   I don't use-- I actually have my bank.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.740]   My bank allows me to pay that--
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.540]   You guys, you are in technology.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.540]   You're technologists.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.060]   And you're all afraid of technology.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.060]   No, we know too much.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.060]   Because you understand how it works.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.060]   We know too much.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.580]   You don't use bill pay?
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.780]   You know, what's-- I mean--
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.580]   No, I don't know.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.100]   No, I don't know.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.340]   You know, I just lived on a camera.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.300]   I got called by lawyers and detectives in two different states
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.260]   that they've later found out they were chasing down
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.820]   a Russian-- basically, a Russian organized crime group
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.700]   that was rotating people through hotels in the United States,
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.540]   scamming people, buying goods and services on eBay.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.460]   Does anybody in Tinsky?
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.100]   No.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.300]   But what happened was I had won a--
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.140]   I had won like a--
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.300]   I was trying to buy a TIG welder.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.740]   I won this auction for the TIG welder.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.740]   What's a TIG welder?
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:26.940]   It's--
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.940]   Well, Stigs.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.100]   It's obvious.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.980]   It's basically Tungsten and Earth gas.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.740]   It's a--
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.380]   Ooh.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.900]   It's not an oxyacetal in it.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.660]   Well, you need a Tungsten--
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.300]   It's a well-dirt for.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   You're building a--
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:38.820]   It's the marine.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.740]   --the electrode.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:40.900]   It's for welding steel and--
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.460]   [BUZZING]
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.420]   --in any case.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.100]   I needed a welder to do--
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.660]   for a project I was working on.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.740]   I won the bid.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.380]   It was suspiciously low.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.060]   There was a picture of a used welder.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.980]   The guy said the welder was actually new.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.660]   And I needed to join me in here now.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.060]   The Western Union, the money.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.180]   I'll do that.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.220]   So the sale was in New York.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   He wanted me to send the money, basically,
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.900]   like a money order to Ohio.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.220]   And then they would be shipping me the welder from Florida.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:07.660]   And you agreed?
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.620]   And I was like, no.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.300]   I was like, OK.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:09.860]   I said, great.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.820]   I'll give the money to escrow.com.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.300]   And you can send the welder.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.020]   And you'll get the money.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.540]   When the welder gets shipped to me.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.820]   Anybody knows silence?
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.820]   Four days later, I get a message.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.380]   I get a message.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.940]   And this guy's like, well, he said,
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.660]   you refused to pay for the welder.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.700]   And he was contacting everybody in the next four highest bids.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.540]   And I sent him $1,700.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   And I'm like, you're never going to see that money again.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.460]   You sent Westridge, you sent $1,700 Western--
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.300]   or $1,000, whatever it was, Western Union.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.820]   This guy apparently, four out of the next five people
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.300]   on the bidding list, all did Western Union
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.940]   to somebody in Indiana or Ohio.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.860]   And so--
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.220]   By the way, the good news, Western Union gone.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.940]   Well, Western Union, whatever it was.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:52.780]   Isn't that gone?
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.940]   Yeah, you can't send money by Telegram anymore.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.620]   Sure you can.
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.140]   Stop.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.860]   I'm sending you this money by a telegram.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.420]   Stop.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.900]   Stop.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.500]   Major Sponday SAP.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.500]   Stop.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.500]   Do you remember those days?
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.220]   No, I don't.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.740]   Did you ever have a little guy run around with a call
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.940]   for John C. de Morak?
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:15.860]   Well, I remember that.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.180]   Yeah, that was just recently.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.700]   Stop.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.260]   So Kevin Rose--
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.980]   That's all Western Union does anymore.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   Send money orders.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.700]   Well, didn't they do the last--
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.500]   OK, I'm sure.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.860]   They do the last telegram.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:27.500]   Maybe the last telegram--
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.980]   We're talking about money transfer.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.980]   Money transfer.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.020]   I pay my car insurance with Western Union.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:32.860]   Do you?
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.420]   But you won't use bill pay?
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.660]   Well, so--
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.180]   Here we go.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.580]   My process is this.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.140]   I can't believe a word with such luddites.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.500]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.100]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:44.980]   Let me add this.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.060]   I remember distinctly a period of time back
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.540]   on the call for help sets where you were complaining.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:50.980]   Complaining.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.340]   Because you set up automated bill pay with the service
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.540]   that you no longer used was still charging you.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:55.940]   It was still--
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.060]   By the way, I don't know how to get out.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:57.660]   Still using it.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.500]   It's called Pay Trust.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.260]   It's in Sioux City, South Dakota.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.260]   I think they were using prisoners to--
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.300]   Sounds right.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   There's a big penitentiary there.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.900]   And then all my bills would get sent to South Dakota
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.060]   and then magically appear on the screen.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.740]   And then they would automatically pay them.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.700]   I still can't cancel that, by the way.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.580]   10 years later.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.380]   Oh, well, that's a good argument for your side of the debate.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.380]   Boy, aren't you technologically advanced, Leo?
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.380]   Woo!
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.380]   Kevin Rose couldn't be here.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:26.900]   Now you know why.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.660]   I heard that, yeah.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.820]   He sent us a video, though.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.820]   Let's-- let's-- do you have that Kevin Rose greeting
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.500]   queued up?
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.260]   And I think somebody else too from our past.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:36.660]   Hey, Leo.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.380]   Kevin Rose here just wanted to wish you
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:42.060]   a huge congrats on 10 years of outstanding content.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.980]   I obviously was a huge fan of yours.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.020]   You probably don't know this.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.780]   I used to watch ZDTV back before I joined TechTV.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.700]   And so to get to work with you on that show back in 2003
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.940]   was an absolute honor.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:54.980]   And I had so much fun.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.580]   I learned a ton from you.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.780]   And then to watch you go and break off and create
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:02.660]   "Twit" as an entrepreneur and build this into an empire,
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.620]   you're always-- have always been an inspiration to me.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.980]   And so I thank you for that.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.220]   And I thank you for the great content.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.260]   I know you've inspired millions of people out there
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.140]   to understand and get to learn technology in an easier way,
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.100]   which only you can do.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.220]   So thank you.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.900]   And I wish you health happiness in another 20, 30, 40
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.540]   plus years of great content.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.020]   Hey, Leo.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.820]   Congratulations to you and the entire "Twit" TV team.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.060]   You guys are also amazing.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.060]   And it feels like just yesterday when
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.420]   I made you sign up for Twitter.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.620]   #NeverForget.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.620]   You guys are amazing.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.740]   I love you all.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.340]   Happy 10th anniversary, Twit.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:38.540]   Bye.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.100]   Thank you, Justine.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:40.620]   Great to see you.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.500]   We have some pictures of Justine on early Mac break.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.940]   Quickly's back in the cottage.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.660]   Always talented, beautiful.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.940]   And she's going to be a big star.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.980]   I just keep-- I know that Hollywood's going to-- she just
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.420]   did it was in a movie recently, "Small Part."
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.140]   But I think she's going to be a big star.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.020]   And thank you, Kevin.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.420]   We really appreciate that star.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.140]   You couldn't be here.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.900]   Do you see the designs for his new app behind him
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.220]   on the blackboard there?
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.940]   Looks like it's square in some--
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.620]   These are just--
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.420]   Maybe rectangular.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.620]   Like I might fit in a watch.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.780]   It was hastily erased before he did it.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.660]   Perhaps hastily written up there.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.460]   Anyway, it's fun.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.860]   I can't imagine anything I'd rather
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.900]   do on our 10th anniversary than bring back
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.820]   the original crew from the very first screen savers.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.180]   It was the "Screen Savers" Twit.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.620]   It was called the Revenge of the Screen Savers
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.220]   because at the time I was bitter.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.660]   I don't know, were you bitter?
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.420]   No, but I take everything a lot less personally.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.060]   Yeah, well, we think you're still bitter.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:29.460]   That's the thing.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.380]   Very bitter.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.380]   You never-- there was never a cease and desist for real.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.860]   So after we called the Revenge of the Screen Savers,
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.140]   they did, in fact, geforce.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.100]   I mean, a letter, not a cease and desist.
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.900]   Nice letter, saying, don't use that name.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   Quan.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.860]   Period, it's a-- don't use a period.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.260]   Period.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.340]   I mean, it wasn't-- it was from a lawyer,
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.380]   but it wasn't a cease and desist.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.300]   It was just like, we'd prefer if you didn't use that name.
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.300]   Because they were-- it was still being--
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.580]   Screen Savers was still on a show, right?
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.060]   Still being--
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:54.700]   Was it really?
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.500]   I thought they were trying to--
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.100]   They hadn't-- no, it wasn't AOTSC yet.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.500]   It was still the Screen Savers.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.060]   It was Kevin Rose and Sarah Lang did it.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.260]   And Kevin Prehr.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.100]   Kevin Prehr came later, didn't he?
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:05.580]   Was he on a--
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.660]   They relaunched Attack of the Show with Chilan Lu
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.020]   and Kevin Prehr as the host.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:10.660]   And the very--
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.820]   That's the very first episode of that show.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.220]   And Olivia Munn.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.220]   She came after Sarah left.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.300]   Eating hot dogs.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.020]   Actually, you remember--
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:18.700]   What was this?
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.700]   And somebody just put it in the chat room.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.700]   Do you remember that when G4 ended Attack of the Show
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.620]   wasn't so long ago, a couple of years ago.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.060]   It was so thrilled Joshua Brantano, who
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.300]   worked with all of us in the tech TV, called us and said,
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.820]   hey, you know, it would be a hoot.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.060]   They don't care anymore.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.900]   Oh my god, oh, yeah.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.740]   He's the best.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.260]   And if you guys came back for the last show
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.780]   and at the very end of the last show,
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.220]   we'll go through us goodbye and what fun it's been.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.660]   And this is our last show.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.220]   And well, take a look.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.500]   This is what the very end of Attack of the Show,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.940]   the last time it aired.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.980]   And this is what you saw.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.180]   Do you have it?
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.660]   Oh, go back a little bit.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.980]   Patrick and I-- here we go.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.740]   Get the audio on this, because I think I'm actually speaking.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.980]   It's xed out.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.980]   There you go.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.220]   This is-- actually play a little bit of this,
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:10.020]   because this is their kind of montage of Olivia
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.660]   money-eating hot dogs of--
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:13.660]   That was something to say.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.460]   Oh, you have a dream.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.460]   I just had the worst--
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:16.900]   No, it's a dream.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.140]   See what happens.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.220]   My math tastes like hot dogs.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.220]   I dreamt that tech TV was sold to a cable company that
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.900]   had a name that was an obsolete Apple processor.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.660]   And they moved us all down to Los Angeles.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:30.500]   LA.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.700]   That's actually worse than the hot dog mouth.
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.260]   And then we had to stop doing tech news.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:39.020]   And we started doing this pop culture nightmare gallery.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.940]   My Uncle Ted was there.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.540]   And we were all eating pie.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.340]   Pie.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.780]   Ooh, never mind.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.060]   It's just too weird.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.980]   I can't explain it.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.820]   What do you think a dream like that means?
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.500]   Who cares?
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.700]   Time to go to work.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.300]   What's the hype machine?
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.900]   Do we ever review that?
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.740]   I don't know.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.740]   You can think about it on the way.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.740]   Come on.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.180]   It's about time to start the show.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:16.340]   That's an alternate history I dig, right?
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.140]   You're a good tech--
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.940]   Bob Doohart.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.140]   The tech TV building.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.220]   But the fact that Brenton--
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.060]   does Brentonna have credit for making that happen?
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.420]   He not even has so good.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:23.900]   He wrote it.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.540]   It's so good.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.340]   And it's a little bit--
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.980]   In some ways, a dig a little bit.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.780]   But that was them.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.060]   And I just say, can we say this?
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.780]   And he said they're no longer paying attention.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.940]   Go right ahead.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.820]   They're like, this is the end date.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.060]   Spend your budget.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.500]   Go.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.420]   What fun.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   We should announce our new show now.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:44.140]   Because this is kind of a fitting segue into this.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.300]   So ever since we started this, people-- in fact,
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:47.820]   you know this.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.140]   We people would always come to us and say,
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.580]   when are you going to do the screen savers again?
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.500]   And now we said, we're not.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.780]   In fact, Patrick and I agreed.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.060]   There's no point in going backwards.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.700]   I don't want to be a county fair act.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.980]   Leo and Patrick--
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.940]   selling shoppers.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.020]   Like, it's half of rush.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.180]   It's not going to--
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.260]   but on the other hand, it was very clear
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.260]   that one of the things that we did with this show--
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.980]   and you were all involved in it--
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.340]   was validate people and that it was OK to be a geek.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.620]   Technology was cool, and it was OK to be interested in it.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.620]   And I even ran into people already today
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.700]   who-- how many of you watched the old screen savers show?
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.420]   And how many of you became geeks because of the old screen
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:27.940]   savers show?
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.860]   I think a lot of you--
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.740]   one.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.020]   That guy.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:32.740]   The handshake.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.580]   But don't you meet people all the time and say,
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.220]   when I first started watching it,
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.660]   and then I got into it because of it,
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.820]   and now I'm doing it for a living.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.060]   And it was an important thing to do,
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.460]   especially in the late '90s, early 2000s.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.260]   And so I thought, I would only do it again
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.100]   if we could do the future.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.900]   Do it again for the future.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:54.060]   And so I think we're going to bring back the screen savers.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.260]   And Patrick, we asked you to be part of it on a regular basis.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.580]   You have something else you're doing,
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.420]   but I know you're going to be the first co-host with me.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:51:59.940]   Cool.
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:03.460]   And John, if you want to, you have to think about this.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.820]   We've invited all of you to be part of this for us.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.420]   We're going to have always have a co-host.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.540]   One of the reasons we want to do it
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.340]   is we have a lot of things we'd like to do
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.820]   that don't merit a weekly show.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.380]   But a variety show really would help us produce,
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.820]   make-your-space stuff.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.740]   And somebody-- Mike wants to do cooking.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.820]   John, I want you to do a segment on how to make vinegar.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.580]   I think that you--
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:27.260]   I'm surprised this has taken you this long.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.580]   Because you build out the studio with a bunch of sub-studios
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.140]   in the--
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.300]   Kind of looks like the screens savers.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.020]   --over there in the corner, which looks like screen savers
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.180]   always look like screens savers.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.860]   But the other day, it still looks like screen savers.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:38.980]   We went down to San Francisco.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.420]   Remember how many times we did two screen savers opens, didn't we?
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:42.940]   Yes.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   Yeah, we drove-- the first one we drove at a very nice--
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.460]   was it a Camaro, a Chaval?
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.180]   What was it?
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.740]   It was a herst--
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:50.780]   The first one?
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.260]   The first one was Jerry's Mustang.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.460]   It was Jerry's Mustang.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.620]   But that was Kate and me.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.260]   Yes.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.180]   That was me and Kate.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.180]   And I remember--
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.180]   The Patrick.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.380]   Because we were trying to make a crime show, sort of--
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:52:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.380]   --thing.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.180]   Well, you drove like that.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.580]   The old 4.2 convertible.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.580]   Yeah, that's what it was.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.780]   And then you moved over to--
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.500]   4.4.2.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.580]   And then herst shifter.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.340]   And the guy told us, don't turn the wheels too hard
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.860]   because the tires are too big.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.360]   No.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:11.860]   No.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   No, don't turn the wheels.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.380]   Don't turn the wheels.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.900]   And then somebody's like, oh, if we can only do a burnout,
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.020]   the guy's like, yeah, no problem.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.020]   I'm like, no problem.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.180]   He's like, sure.
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:24.060]   You got to get up to about 4,000 RPM and then just drop the clutch.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.740]   And I got up to 4,000 RPM and I dropped the clutch.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.820]   And you squealed.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:32.380]   You bite the most amazing noise and terrifying.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.460]   There's nothing worse than you're--
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.860]   You've never seen anyone do that, apparently.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.900]   No.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.700]   In fact, I don't even have those pants anymore.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.780]   I actually should probably--
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.740]   Well, it's a good thing because I
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.700]   got to fly with the Blue Angels because Lee was like,
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.980]   I'm going to fly with the Blue Angels.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.540]   And you passed out.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.020]   The second one we did--
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.300]   as it turned out, the first one was the safe one.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.340]   The second one, we rented those little weird things
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.540]   that you drive around San Francisco.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.140]   You almost flipped it.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.420]   I'm going, god, we're going to die.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.140]   We're going to die.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.660]   It's such a stupid show to die for.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.060]   Those little yellow things?
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.700]   Then you got the Blue Angels.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.860]   These were before the little yellow things.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.820]   They were the worst of a scooter, a go-kart,
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.180]   with this silver loop up between the two passenger seats
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.740]   and then two huge outriggers.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.780]   You're riding a five-year-old's bicycle.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.940]   And they were like, it is impossible to flip.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.940]   No.
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.100]   No, no, no.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.500]   They had two wheels in front and one wheel in the back
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.300]   of the middle of the rear of the bicycle.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.780]   And they were like, we need it to rock.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:31.020]   So I'm like jamming the steering wheel back and forth.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.460]   Scared.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.900]   The blood just went like this.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.380]   Oh, it's very scary.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.860]   Anyway, we don't want to recreate the screensavers,
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.660]   but we want a nod to the nostalgia of it.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.420]   So we made the new open for the new show.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.620]   Actually, can we roll that?
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:44.460]   I think we have it.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.740]   This is the return of the screensavers.
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.740]   So we wanted to have us arrive on rockets,
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.100]   but we couldn't manage that.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.940]   Maybe on another one.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.140]   In fact, we have some segues in the back,
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.420]   and before you guys leave, we want to get a little green screen
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.180]   and we can add you guys to it.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.900]   All of the Twit team is going to be part of this.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.820]   We're going to do-- yes, you can do it as well, Milo.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.340]   You already got to, all right.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.980]   All of the Twit team is going to be part of this.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.900]   And all of you, I hope, will be a part of it,
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.300]   because I'm very excited that I feel like we have the facilities
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:07.500]   to do it.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.900]   We have the staff to do it.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:11.260]   And it is going to be a tip of the hat to something
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.940]   that I think was really important in our lives.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.620]   But also, look ahead for the future generation.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.820]   So I'm very excited about that.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.460]   May 2nd that launches.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.020]   We're going to shoot that Saturday afternoon.
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:21.780]   You'll be able to watch us shoot it live.
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:22.940]   Come up, I hope.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:24.300]   I think you're due for May 2nd.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:24.740]   I believe so.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.060]   I believe you're down for May 2nd.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.140]   So Patrick will be part of the first show,
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.540]   and we hoped you would come on May 10th.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.980]   No, no, no.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:32.500]   30th?
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.820]   On the 10th, I'm not here.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.820]   So when?
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:35.980]   Yeah, yes.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.460]   Why not?
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.700]   Now that you've seen it--
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.380]   Yeah, it looks like--
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.940]   John said you know what your book's for.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.020]   --every hit television.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.660]   I lost five bucks on a bet, by the way.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.780]   Thanks to this.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.140]   The Curry said they're going to do this, right?
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:47.980]   And you didn't think so.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.540]   No, I thought you were going to do a travel show.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.100]   I think this-- well, but that's one of the things
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.300]   is we would try to do a travel show, a med tech show.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.820]   And this way we could put little segments in throughout.
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:58.780]   We've got a board in the back.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.220]   There's some really fun stuff planned.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.020]   So we're very excited.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.300]   Thank you for putting up with that.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.820]   We wanted to make sure people knew about that.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.380]   I guess it was on Reddit earlier today.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.940]   Somebody found it.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.300]   Oh, well, that's OK.
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.860]   That's OK.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:10.940]   It leaked out.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.620]   So I'll put it--
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.180]   How could that be possible?
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:13.860]   I don't know.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:14.380]   You know what?
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.300]   It's all made me stomach yet.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.860]   Our audience is really--
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.180]   It's on the cloud.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.340]   And they-- yeah, you know what?
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.100]   Our mistake was we put it on the cloud.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.660]   So are you going to have live call in?
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.340]   Live call in?
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.460]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.500]   Going to have call in.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.660]   It's going to be very similar.
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.340]   We're even going to have a mailbag--
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.540]   You know, we always have a mailbag segment
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.100]   at the end of the show because it was the G spot.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.260]   It was what they call in the business.
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:37.980]   The G spot?
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.620]   The G spot.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.380]   A mailbag and mailbag.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.140]   How's those two things go together?
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.860]   Later on, it became the end spot when we did the 90-minute show.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:46.860]   That's crazy.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.860]   But ABCD/EFG--
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.660]   whatever, sex segment, seven seconds.
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.220]   So we always did that as an accordion
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.860]   because you didn't know how long the show would be.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.260]   It had to be exactly 44 minutes.
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.500]   It was the A block or spot, if you want to call it that.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.060]   And then commercial break B. And then we went 90 minutes.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.620]   We had it all the way through K, which for all of us
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:06.540]   working in our rundown, we have to go through that--
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.740]   That was a 90-minute segment.
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:08.460]   --90 minutes.
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:08.820]   Oh, man.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.700]   Five days a week.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.620]   But the best part about it is a lot of the tech TV shows
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:13.940]   were not even live to tape.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.420]   They were just taped and edited.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.780]   And the nice thing about doing a live show
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:18.860]   is you tape it and you are done.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.940]   Why do you think that's all we do with live shows?
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.300]   That's usually the one we had to re-rack the darn thing
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.180]   and take out some random expletive
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.900]   the pat left or something like that.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.900]   That happened once.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.580]   It never happened.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.500]   Exactly once.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.060]   There's an obvious question that needs to be asked.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.460]   So this is the intellectual property of Comcast.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.900]   Did you get permission to change it?
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.400]   No.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.100]   Then why did you listen to them the first day of the show?
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.600]   They let trademark lapse because they were still
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.020]   doing a show called The Screen Savers.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:44.820]   They haven't done one in ages.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.780]   They don't care?
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.820]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.500]   We'll find out.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.380]   Same letter.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.340]   This letter will ignore.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.900]   We've actually consulted with Legal and they said it's OK.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.900]   Oh, Legal and upstairs, OK.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.180]   Legal said it's always OK.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.980]   There's always a number of the ACs.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.180]   And actually, we debated whether to use it.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.780]   We had floated this by you whether you thought it was a good idea.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.540]   But why not?
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.980]   And it kind of is an immediate way.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.640]   Oh, I get it.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.000]   I know what they're going to be doing.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:10.760]   So why not?
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.880]   You could have kept that old audience.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.560]   The ones that are still alive.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:14.880]   And the Dell watch.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.360]   I used to watch that show.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.760]   Who owns the dot com?
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   Don't tell me it's just lapsed and sitting there.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.920]   Someone's going to nail it right there.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.760]   We nailed everything we could, I think.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.320]   We have the new screensavers.com.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.760]   I don't know if we tried to get the screensavers.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.720]   Remember, that was a whole thing, wasn't it?
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.320]   They named the show before finding out
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.440]   if there was a domain available.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.240]   And it wasn't.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.720]   We had the link as the screen.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.480]   Eventually, we couldn't get call for help,
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.180]   because wasn't that already taken by someone?
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.060]   Well, so was the screensavers.
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.560]   When we started, remember our t-shirts
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.760]   said zdtv.com/the screensavers.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.180]   Remember that?
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.360]   The early days.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.480]   But eventually, I think they found--
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.560]   What a glorious website we launched to it.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.640]   That was a constant battle.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.920]   Tom Merritt was the executive editor of the screensavers
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.480]   website.
[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:58.980]   Yes.
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.240]   Actually, he was the whole thing, wasn't he?
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.320]   The entire web domain.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.880]   And it was profitable when Comcast bought it.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.160]   And then they showed it wasn't--
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.480]   Oh, the website website was--
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.080]   Website was making over $2 million a year.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.560]   And Comcast was like, we don't do websites and shut it down.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.640]   They said, but we'll take it.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.480]   And they sent the box, the server, to LA.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.640]   And it's kind of like--
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.560]   Still there.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.120]   It's still there.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.360]   It's like the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.960]   It's in a very big warehouse at the back.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.560]   Well, they migrated the content off eventually.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.800]   In part because they made a lot of--
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.000]   Part of the reasons we delayed this--
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.160]   and we finally doing--
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.080]   we have been talking to NBC Universal for several years
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.640]   trying to get rights.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:44.960]   How many?
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960]   Three.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.120]   A little over--
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.040]   Almost three years.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.720]   Just to get the tapes.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.360]   Not to do the show, just to get the tapes.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.720]   But they say they have all the--
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.760]   I know you don't believe this.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.440]   I don't believe it.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.720]   You need the tapes of the show?
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.240]   Yeah, we wanted the old screensavers.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.680]   We're going to do a kind of mystery science
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.120]   here at the theater 3000 with the old screensavers.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.280]   And we'd sit here just like this and watch the show
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.920]   and laugh at ourselves.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.200]   I have like eight.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.000]   And they're on YouTube, too.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.080]   We wanted the originals.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.000]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   I have like eight to 10 of them.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.200]   They actually cataloged all of it really.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.720]   They had had it cataloged.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.920]   I mean, it was all tapes, but they barcodeed it all of them,
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.240]   put keywords on all of it.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.560]   And the tape library, quite frankly, for back then,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.600]   was pretty well organized.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.080]   And I remember trying to find a clip of something back when
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.720]   Joshua Bintana was still there.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.080]   And they could go find in their deep archive.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.120]   They couldn't find it because they had tossed all the everywhere.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.920]   I mean, it's there, but it's like in boxes
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.160]   and whatever that original database that linked all those barcodes,
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.440]   they might be somewhere.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.120]   I walked into the office one day,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.120]   and there was a big box of silicon spin tapes.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.880]   Oh, huge.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.920]   It was like all the shows for two years.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.720]   I said, what are you guys doing with these tapes?
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.200]   Well, we can't reuse them, so we're throwing them out.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:56.640]   Yeah, but--
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.120]   And I remember--
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:57.880]   We took them home.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.760]   But those were the tapes that they shot on in the--
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.360]   Those were the tapes that the extra capture in the video.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.000]   Because everything got put on a hard drive.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.280]   Right.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.120]   Eventually, yeah.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:05.680]   No, no, no.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   So they could air it.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.200]   They'd never made the tape anymore.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.680]   So they could air it.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.880]   They would shut the DVC Pro, and then it wasn't right away.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.360]   But within a few years, the knock was using hard drives.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.800]   I remember Kevin Mallon, I think it was.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.080]   And they brought in this machine.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.120]   They rented it for oodles of money.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.560]   They wanted to digitize things so that they could do longer
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.480]   commercial breaks, and they secretly would speed up
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.720]   and speed up stuff.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.200]   So you'd be speaking, but you would voice modulate.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.080]   But they didn't have longer.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.560]   But they digitized everything in order
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.240]   to make longer commercial breaks.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.720]   So there's masters in these masters.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.400]   What you have, Roger, is probably one kind of master.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.000]   We've been told by them--
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   I had a stack of them because I needed to return it
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.240]   because I was doing an edit for the show.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.600]   But they're DVC Pro, right?
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.400]   And they say, OK, you're done.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.160]   It's like, all right.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:49.960]   See you.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.760]   I'll take my stuff with it.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.560]   So I have eight to 10.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.440]   And they're probably--
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.320]   They have assured us that everything that Tech TV did,
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.560]   not just the screensavers, but Silicon Spin Your Show,
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.000]   everything that they did, is somewhere in a storage locker.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.920]   And we cannot persuade them.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.520]   We say, well, we're have shared with you.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.680]   We've been in unable--
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.120]   Because they don't have them.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.920]   Or it's buried in an alley.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.760]   They're lying to you.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.040]   Mountain storage.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.920]   Well, if they don't have them, they could just say, oh,
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.520]   we don't have them.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.000]   Thanks.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.080]   See, they figured you might sue them or something.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.120]   There's just a very conservative thing to do.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120]   It's a stall.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   Isn't it thinking that you were at the same time?
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.440]   And then I couldn't throw money out of together.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.760]   We tried to throw money out of them.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.560]   And they said it probably wasn't that funny.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.800]   I think I had 50 bucks I threw at it.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.760]   There's some money.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.400]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.840]   For this, I'd be amazed.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.600]   Well, now you just make new content.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.800]   Right.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.760]   We don't really need the old content that much.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.040]   It was very dated.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.520]   But it would have been fun.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.560]   Anyway, that's how this started.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.600]   Eventually, we just said, oh, screw it.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.160]   We'll just make new stuff.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.280]   We'll start over.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.200]   So I hope you watch.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.360]   And we were going to continue with a very special 10th anniversary
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.000]   edition with some of my closest friends still,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.400]   because I don't have any new friends.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   Roger Chang.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.560]   Congratulations on the baby.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.760]   Where are you working these days?
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.480]   I am freelancing.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.920]   And then I'm helping out--
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.400]   That don't work.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.760]   --top with DTNS.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.240]   DTNS.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:08.880]   Oh, good.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.560]   Oh, that's great.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.320]   But he's in LA.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.440]   Are you up here?
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:12.960]   All right.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.800]   And David Prager, I've wondered what's your dude--
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.200]   because you've got a pretty big payout.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.800]   I'm sure after a Vision 3 got sold to Discovery.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.080]   It was a modest amount.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.040]   Enough to not have to work right away.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.520]   Enough to seven years after running something,
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.040]   enough to be able to take a bit of a break
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   and think about what you wanted.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:27.880]   That was nice.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880]   And you're still thinking?
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.720]   No.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.760]   I started an ad agency.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.440]   Oh.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.440]   I think I've talked about this before to some extent.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.440]   Maybe not on Twitter.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.600]   I don't think you've done this about it.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.120]   I'm not saying this.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.840]   Yeah, it's called the assembly.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.680]   Oh, it sounds familiar.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.120]   So CMB.ly.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.560]   The catalyst for that was basically making product videos,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.840]   kind of almost like Kickstarter campaigns.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.120]   Of course, the one that have any Kickstarter campaign outside
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.760]   of the product or service itself is the video that
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.160]   tells the story about that.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.200]   And so did that kind of for fun when someone was like,
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.880]   hey, I've got this fun with the Kickstarter campaigns.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.920]   We do that.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.000]   And then it turned into, why don't we graduate from doing
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.960]   Kickstarter campaign videos to doing Fortune 500 ads?
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.560]   And then once we did a couple of--
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.040]   started doing a couple of deals for companies like GAP
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.960]   and Whole Foods, it was more like--
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.440]   the startups are the more interesting ones.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.760]   They just don't have as deep a pocket,
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.640]   but we'd rather do that.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.360]   So right now, we're doing this hybrid model of some
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.880]   of the larger companies that are public,
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.080]   and then some of the startups that we're passionate about
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.320]   or some of the ones that are interested in affording
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.240]   some real marketing, and then the ones that can't
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.640]   we're starting to dabble more in, taking some of the payment
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.520]   for what we do as equity and some of the startups.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   There's a website right there.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.720]   That's what I'm doing right now.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.360]   Nice.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.400]   And it's going well, it sounds like.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.840]   Yeah, it's a big appliance.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.760]   John, what have you been doing in the last 10 years?
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.600]   Pretty much nothing.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.480]   I'm retired.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.040]   Oh, that's right.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.200]   I do some podcasting.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.920]   I do a thing called the Noah Geneshow.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.600]   It's available at NoahGeneshow.com.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.520]   We're on episode 714.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.080]   Isn't that man?
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:50.960]   At 714.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.440]   But at two a week, that probably only took you
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.840]   315 weeks.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.720]   Something like that.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.760]   And then I do DHM plugged with Andrew Horowitz,
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.120]   and we discussed the stock market,
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.040]   and we're pretty good at picking stocks,
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.400]   even though we don't do it for--
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.280]   we don't recommend them.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.880]   Did you set up a dummy account so you could just
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.200]   track your investments?
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:07.760]   No.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.840]   You should have.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.320]   What's the point?
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.480]   We have a-- it's pointless.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.800]   It's just you give us a spreadsheet.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.240]   You want to track the investments going?
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:15.760]   It'd be rich today.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.200]   Actually, on a couple of these things, we probably would be.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   And then I come on here once in a while.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.840]   I still write for PC Magazine available at PCMag.com.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.120]   I have a column that comes out every week,
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.720]   and then there's a kind of a magazine.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.960]   But again, I think No Agenda at No Agenda Show.com
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.160]   is probably where you want to go to see what we're really up to.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.800]   Twice a week now.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.480]   Now twice weekly.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.120]   There it is.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.280]   Mr. Patrick Norton, we know you're doing well with TechThing.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.520]   I'm glad to do that too.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.040]   That's great.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.360]   And then what was it?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.920]   Don't do this at home because it's going to hurt your tongue?
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.120]   Possibly Unsafe with Michael Hand, which is the DIY show.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   Possibly Unsafe.com.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.960]   TechThing, T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.com, or YouTube.com/TechThing.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.840]   And Mr. Robert Heron and I have a new thing.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.560]   What?
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.080]   Oh, my.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:58.640]   Tell us about it.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.520]   You're launching it?
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.920]   Are you launching it here today?
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.640]   This is a surprise to Robert.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.120]   I really did.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.560]   Sorry.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.480]   So Robert does home--
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.480]   Tell me one second.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.080]   --do installations of home theaters, that kind of thing.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.760]   Yeah, mostly the idea of the calibration too.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.800]   That's pretty much special.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.240]   Are you a THX certified, Dolby certified?
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.760]   THX ISF.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.040]   And you do both of them.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.400]   Those are the two big ones, T-H-X.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:21.900]   They are.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.520]   If you're going to do that for any length of time,
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.520]   you should get those certifications.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.080]   I had Scott Wilkinson come in and do my TV.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.440]   It made it--
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.680]   Ian, I worked on your--
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.680]   Oh, you were there for the OLED.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.480]   Which didn't need much, I was surprised.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.360]   No, pretty good set, although Samsung spent out of the game
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.040]   as far as OLED goes for the last couple of years.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.120]   They made that one, and it was beautiful.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.160]   But they're waiting.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.280]   They made that one, Leo bought it, and they said, OK,
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.120]   that's good thing.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.080]   Oh, actually, we're calibrating another OLED, one of LG's new ones.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.720]   Are they still-- do you think OLED's the top--
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.960]   thing you can get right?
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.040]   I mean, Plasma's gone.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.600]   Yeah, it is.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:51.960]   Sad to say.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.000]   And it is the best fry candy.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.520]   It does that dark black.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:55.960]   It's beautiful.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.040]   If you're sitting in a dark room,
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.160]   it has the best contrast of any TV you can possibly
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.240]   buy right now.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.800]   There are some other technologies coming out,
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.840]   and so the next five years, that will probably
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.600]   give it a good run.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:05.600]   But--
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.120]   Yes, there are.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.480]   If you've been at CES, you'd already own a new TV.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.320]   Why would you see?
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.680]   Because the--
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.480]   there was just their 4K.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.480]   What are they?
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.120]   LCD.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:15.840]   OLED.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.760]   Oh, actually, the Samsung--
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.600]   see, these are still good.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.000]   Samsung is doing what they call high dynamic range.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.440]   Right.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.000]   So is Panasonic 2 and 3.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   I think maybe as much as 4K going to be the next thing,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:24.200]   isn't it?
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:24.760]   It's going to be odd.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.320]   8K.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.800]   8K, what are you showing those to?
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.760]   And NHK is already shooting at 4K content.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.360]   What are you going to get?
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   8K.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.000]   Actually, there's some of the 4K dynamic range content.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.240]   So either movies that were shot.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.160]   So that's what she's doing some HDR.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:38.660]   Totally.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.160]   And that's going to probably the one of first ways
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   you'll see it.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.040]   Is there a devil HDR or what?
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.000]   What is daredevil?
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.080]   Because it looks weird.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.720]   Anything I think that's been shot in the last couple
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.000]   years, any of the new digital cinema cameras
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   has enough stops of exposure in order
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.840]   to create or to remaster it as HDR.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.560]   The complexity really is that if you think about the studio
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.920]   monitors that the producers are looking at when they make
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.360]   this content for distribution, they're not looking at HDR
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.200]   displays.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:04.960]   So--
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.280]   Well, good.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.480]   Because neither are we.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.920]   But how are you going to make content that's not--
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.600]   if you don't know the characteristics of the display,
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.000]   it's going to be really hard to make content that's
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.360]   supposedly high dynamic range.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.520]   Just now solving that for 4K so that at every step of the way,
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.800]   you know what you're going to get.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.080]   There's a standard in the TV.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.400]   We'll reflect what's shot.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.840]   And we still don't have those TVs.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.160]   That's not till the end of this year, right?
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.640]   The beauty about Netflix in particular
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.720]   is that there's a new HDMI standard, the plug type,
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.880]   that is now supporting the metadata for high dynamic range.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.640]   That would be embedded in the content.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.480]   But if you have--
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.200]   Always something.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.600]   You're going to get your streaming content
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.760]   over the internet and things like Netflix,
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.440]   it's just going to be a software update for the TV.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.000]   You won't have to worry about a port.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.760]   You won't have to worry about an upgrade there.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.560]   And this is broader gray.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.080]   This is broader color gamut.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.600]   It's a different color gamut.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.400]   That's the potential.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.360]   The space is different.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.400]   They want to use the same color space
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.240]   that they're using in commercial cinema right now,
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.200]   which is, say, another 50% larger than what they use for HD.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.360]   So a bigger palette of color, more saturated colors.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.400]   That's probably just as important as high dynamic range.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.600]   Although high dynamic range really has a good look to it.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.960]   The TVs that will really be able to support that, though,
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.920]   are mine.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.720]   Are going to be expensive.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.600]   No, you know what?
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.200]   No, you're--
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.080]   No, you're getting screwed.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.080]   That's a debate, though.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.440]   No, it won't be able to do the p-par.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.840]   Don't you think the 4K--
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.320]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.800]   But how about better content?
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.960]   Well, don't you think the 4K TVs are going
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.240]   to deploy faster than HD did over standard death?
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.160]   I think it's going to be a lot faster.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.200]   You know what, drive that is 3D.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.960]   Because these 3D displays had to have more resolution
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.560]   so that they could do--
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.760]   Don't you remember when you used to watch
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.600]   all this underwater nature stuff?
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.320]   Because it was the only content available in HD at first.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.440]   The equal soaring stuff we saw at CS every year.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.200]   It's kind of ridiculous.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.240]   The World Cup that happened last year had noor it.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.280]   An entire of four games is the largest sporting event
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:48.720]   in the planet.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.520]   Four games only were done in 4K.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.680]   Next World Cup, it's going to be 100% all of them streaming.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.000]   It's kind of a-- I was at a ball game on Friday,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.520]   and there's HD cameras everywhere.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.880]   And I thought, remember when this was a special thing?
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   And it's not special at all.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.280]   It's just--
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.840]   Well, go look at the World Series or even all the MLB playoffs.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.600]   And they've got probably 750 frames per second
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.200]   on everything happening at the plate.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.760]   And that's only in the last three years.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.800]   Super, super slow moment.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.520]   Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.280]   They did that at the Olympics a couple of years back
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.160]   and we see introduced those cameras that would do a minimum
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.320]   of 500 frames a second.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.240]   And that really took off.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.880]   For archive purposes, 4K AK is the way it is currently.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.440]   But don't focus so much on resolution.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.320]   It's really, I think, more about being
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.560]   able to produce a really bright image in a welllet room
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.640]   or the really inky dark black level
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.120]   so that OLED can be in a darkerlet room.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:34.560]   So--
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.440]   And as John says, let's get the--
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.880]   Bring back the shadow, right?
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.800]   The Lone Ranger.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.400]   Now, that was a show.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.000]   They did try to--
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.200]   I don't know why you're going with this.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.000]   Alan's alley in Fibber McGee.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.800]   Remember them?
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.400]   No.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.000]   Grudge, bring back great content like they used to do.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.600]   I think Daredevil was already shot in 4K.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.680]   Like a lot of the new stuff.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.680]   But they're processing it.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.200]   Have you seen it?
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.520]   It's heavily processed.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.120]   It's oversaturated.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   I mean, part of it, that's just a look.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:01.600]   Right.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600]   It's a look they want to go for it.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.600]   It's going to make a lot of it.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.440]   Buy bigger TVs.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.000]   Bigger is better.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.600]   Bigger.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.680]   Projectors system.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.200]   Projectors.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:08.680]   Projectors.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.680]   Projectors, projectors.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   That's because our new show--
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.680]   Come on, tell us.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.680]   What?
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.680]   We going to do it, man?
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.680]   I want to make it excel.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.680]   Come on.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.680]   Tell.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.680]   Tell.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.680]   Tell me.

[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   Tell me.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680]   Tell me.
