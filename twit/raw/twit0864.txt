[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech, our hearts and our prayers and our thoughts going out to the people of Ukraine.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   We'll talk about how war has changed thanks to technology and how cyber war may be the next step.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.400]   We'll have some fun with a hot new game that's way too hard for me.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.200]   Elden Ring, Georgia Dowell, will explain how to play better.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000]   We've got Lisa Schmeiser in the house.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.200]   Owen J. J. Stono, doctor's also here.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000]   We'll talk about the web telescope, the steam deck,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.800]   and then some recommendations for your next game.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.400]   Hey, a quick reminder before we get into the show,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   last chance to take the annual Twit survey.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.800]   We only do this once a year. We want to get to know you better.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   But the survey runs out the 28th, which is Monday.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.600]   So if you haven't taken it yet and it's still in time, it's still not Monday,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600]   or just before the end of the day Monday,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.200]   go to twit.tv/survey22 and thanks in advance.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.000]   Now on with the show.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.200]   Podcasts you love.

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we cover the latest Tech News.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We're going to have a fun time
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   because Lisa Schmeiser is here with a brand new job editor-in-chief at No Jitter.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hi Lisa!
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Hi, thank you for having me back.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I got a warning I can read your whiteboard. Is that okay?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's all planned activities for the Girl Scout troop.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Oh, it's not like the secrets of world domination or anything like that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   No, that's on my other wall.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Maybe your Girl Scout troop is planning that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I would not put it past them.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yes, service project. Would you rather who wants to go camping?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I get it. It's Girl Scouts.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You told me that Girl Scout cookies are experiencing a supply chain shortage.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's right. It is Girl Scout cookie season.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   If you are lucky enough to know a Girl Scout, ask her if she's selling through digital cookie
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   and see if you can get your packages shipped to you
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   because in some parts of the country there's been a bit of a supply chain breakdown
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and we're having a hard time getting cookies from the bakers into our hot little hands to sell to you.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Wow! I mean, I've heard of supply chain shortages hitting cars, hitting computers, hitting graphics cards.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Cookies?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I think some of it's labor too.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Well, yeah, that's a problem.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   That's a problem, sure.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It was something we were not really expecting this year, so it was a big surprise.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You know, you got to raise the price of the Girl Scout cookies so they could pay the bakers more.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   They actually did.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'm down with that.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   All boxes.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah, for the Girl Scouts of Northern California, all of the boxes are now $6 apiece.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So the price is...
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It goes in the pockets of the oligarchs who run the baking companies that I'm not happy.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   If it goes into the pockets of the people at the ovens, I'm down for that.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's...
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   People have to learn a minimum wage.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   People say, "Oh, nobody wants to work."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Nobody wants to work for your crappy wages.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Nobody wants to work.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Pay them what they're worth and...
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Pay up, deadbeat.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Which is why, by the way, there's only about 15 people left working here.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   No, no, no.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Guys have also been remote for...
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah, that's the real problem.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It feels like Ghost Town.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And even though the mask mandates have been lifted, we are not rushing people back into the studio.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Slowly, Jason's been doing a show from here and slowly working our way back in.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Also with us, I love seeing her.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It's Georgia Dow.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Everybody's favorite psychotherapist, YouTube psychotherapist.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Hi, Georgia.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Hello.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Nice to be here.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   You're not going to wear the angel wings for the show.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   You want me to wear the...
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They're not fully... they're short still.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   They're not going to be the same.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You got more.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Just tiny.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Where do you get the feathers?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They're not even good.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I bought them from Amazon.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I know I shouldn't support Amazon, but they show up so well.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So I have to like, I'm going to double their...
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Are they bird feathers, you think?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah, they're bird feathers, but I think it would be just way too.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Still be too short.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   What kind of...
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I'm doing it for you for you.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You do the Therapist React stuff.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I know you're doing...
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah, so I need bigger.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You're too small.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We've been talking about your arcane series because people love arcane.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And now you're going to do euphoria.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Oh.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Yeah, I did too already.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Oh, you did jewels and rue already?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Okay.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Are they just screwed up?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I mean, that's really the answer, isn't it?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   They're just a mess.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Well, like they have maladaptive ways of dealing with things, right?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   There you go.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   That's how a Therapist talks.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   They're maladaptive.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It's great to see you.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Thank you for being here, Georgia.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And of course, if Georgia Dow is here, we've got to have the old doctor here.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh, and yeah, it's part of the deal.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's going to be one of those shows that Chatham is saying, "Oh, it's a Dr. Dow show."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's fascinating.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It kept my twit away from me for so long.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I had to go make a little pop of her.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Oh my God, that's so cute.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Isn't that you?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Isn't that you?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Just just so you know, I'm always here with you.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I'm just here with you.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I know my desk, Georgia.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I know Ann's jealous that no, you can't have one.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Wow.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Georgia, I wrote a name in the back.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I got a little capo in there.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I love it.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Do you love it?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Is that really Georgia?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I mean, do you have a, what are those called?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Funka toys?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Don't they look like the same person?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Georgia has a Funko part.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Hey, I don't know.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Who does it look like to you?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I'm saying, you just saw, I mean, I'm just saying.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It does.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Especially when she's in her cosplay.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Oh, it's so cute.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Since I'm a doctor, you know, I also keep my nurse with me too.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Oh, of course.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   The course you have to.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Are you going to get the one of me?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That's available.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   The trash can of the dog.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I don't know what the trash can is what the dog comes in.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I don't know why they're showing the box.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I know the dog comes in.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It might be a special case.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Oh, it's three.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Now, it's probably one of those hard cases.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's a pop shield protector to protect this box.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I was going to like, why are they showing the box?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   That's silly.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   There we go.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Harry Dogg.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   That's for Georgia.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Georgia Bulldog.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That kind of a dog.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Anyway, couldn't have all three of you on a week that they're really the news is Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Notice we are blue and gold here in solidarity with the people of Ukraine who are suffering at the hands of a madman who has decided just unilaterally to invade that country.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   One of the things that there really are a bunch of tech stories associated with this war in Ukraine.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   First of all, Ukraine is the home of many, many very good tech companies.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Some of our sponsors, in fact, Grammarly, one of our sponsors was founded in Ukraine.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The dev team is mostly in the Ukraine.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Still, our hearts and prayers go out to everybody in Ukraine who are, I think, doing a great job defending themselves surprisingly against the Russian menace.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I also want to say, I'll mention it to some other companies, but before I say that, I also want to say, I know we have many listeners both in Ukraine and Russia.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I think they're suffering on both sides all because of this guy Putin.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I think the Russian people are great people, but as we have had in the past, you've got a bad leader.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   All of the reprobation from my end comes for Putin and his henchmen in the oligarchs, not for the people of Russia.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   They're suffering too.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Grammarly, Skylum, it was one of my, do you ever use any of the Skylum products with your photography, O-Doctor?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   They do Luminar.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Some really great tools.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Scott Born was their...
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I was just talking to you about that, Luminar.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   That's like the only good AI available.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's really an interesting AI editor.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And in fact, if you go to Skylum.com at the very top of the page, Save Ukraine, defend democracy, and there's a whole page.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It says Skylum was proudly founded in Ukraine.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Our core development center is based in Kiev.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And then here's the thing that kind of both touches me and breaks my heart.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   At this harrowing time, unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the on-time delivery of updates to Luminar Nero.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Neo Dudes, chill.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's okay.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   You've got more important things to do.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Protect yourself. Protect your families.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   They also said because you don't know how many people don't even know that that's where they're based at.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   People just get on the internet and complain about things like, "Oh, that's why they have no idea."
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   So you put that statement out there.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So at least when somebody goes to check, it's like, "Oh, okay."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Yes.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I get it.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You know.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Yes.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Just for the grumpy, is it get grumpy before they realize why they're grumpy.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   A lot of tech companies use programmers in Ukraine.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   A lot of companies found it in Ukraine.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And I know we have listeners in Ukraine, so we're thinking of you.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   We really are.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   The supply chain shortage we talk about is going to be morning Girl Scout cookies, both in Russia and Ukraine.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   The big export curves and then the shutting down a swift.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Both are going to impact Russia hard in terms of technology.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   The thing that concerns me, and this was a story from NBC I saw earlier this week, that actually really
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   scared me.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Biden has been presented with options for massive cyber attacks against Russia.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And this comes from NBC's sources, two intelligence officers with the US, one Western intelligence
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   official, and another person briefed on the matter.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Biden was presented with, now, I guess I would imagine in a case like this, the president is
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   presented with many, many options.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Not all of which are serious or on the table or not, not all of which he would actually consider.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I'm hoping he doesn't consider these, including an attack on the Russian internet, to disrupt
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   internet connectivity across Russia, shutting off electric power, tampering with railroad
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   switches that did happen in Belarus, an individual hacker shut down the Belarus railway system
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   last a couple of weeks ago.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   A person briefed on the matter, said you could do everything from slow the trains down to
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   have them fall off the tracks.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   My concern is if we allow this conventional warfare to become cyber warfare, the damage
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   goes worldwide, and it comes right back to us.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Lisa, does it seem to you that this is a war that we should not be fighting as a cyber war?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I think it's important to sort of reframe the war in general and to understand that if you
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   talk to a lot of people in the tech security space, they're going to argue that we've been
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   at war with Russia for quite a while anyway.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   75% of all ransomware comes out of Russia.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You have to remember Russia has been actively interfering in U.S. elections on national
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   and local levels since at least 2014, if not earlier.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I've been going to RSA every year since, I want to say 2015, 2016, and this is something
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   that I've heard in private one-on-one conversations with sources.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   This is something I've heard when I've sat in on sessions, this is something I've heard
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   in Kynitz, which is that the nature of 21st century warfare is cyber warfare.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   It can be anything from destabilizing elections so that the population loses belief in the
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   legitimacy of elections.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   It can be creating memes and monkeying with sources of information so that people don't
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   know what sources of information to trust, and that helps erode a chance of a national
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   dialogue where everybody is working from the same definition of reality.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   You do have state sponsored agencies that have hacked into U.S. companies across all
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   sectors from transportation to utilities to retail to private security.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   These efforts have been ongoing for quite some time.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   What's a little unusual right now, I think, is that we have a story which has hit NBC,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   and I would suggest that the Biden administration has probably been floating it out there as a
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   scyops thing too, that says, "You know what?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   We're going to take this war to cyberspace because that is where 21st century warfare
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   is."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I think it's a shift in how we are defining and looking at war, but these are activities
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   that have gone on for quite some time already.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   A spokesperson for the National Security Council to L.M.E.C.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   This report is wildly off base and does not reflect what is actually being discussed
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   in the shape or form, but it's kind of like Putin saying, "Hey, don't forget, we've got nukes."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Yeah, well, they always say that though.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I'm not trying to belittle.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So fun fact, my dad worked on nuclear subs through the 70s and 80s.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Oh, really?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Interesting.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   No, it was, and I grew up, I'm a gen Xer, so we grew up with the threat of nuclear war.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Leo, I'm sure you remember it in the 80s when they had the day after.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Remember that TV movie, the whole thing?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So at the time we were living in Tiedwater, Virginia, and I was a kid and I was completely
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   freaked out about, "Oh my God, what if the Soviets, Nukas and our baths?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   How would we survive?"
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Oh, I lived my whole childhood in the fear of that.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   You know, I was born in '56, so we had duck and cover drills, the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   We came very close to nuclear war in 1963.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   In fact, I remember visiting McGeorge Bundy, who was the national security advisor to President
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   JFK at that time.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   He's the guy who woke up Kennedy and said, "Mr. President, we found satellite photos of
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   missiles in Cuba."
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And was, went through that, and I remember visiting his house, his apartment in New York
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   City, and he had a really interesting thing on his coffee table.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   It was a month of October with some little pins in it.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I said, "What's that?"
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   He said, "Oh, yeah.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   JFK gave all of this.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   That's the 10 days in October that we were coming.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   We came within inches."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.640]   He gives credit to his wife, Mary, because he came home one day from the White House and
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.720]   he said, "We're this close to nuclear war with Russia."
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.960]   And she said, "McGeorge, you can't let that happen.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.520]   You have to go in there and you have to fight for peace.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.440]   You cannot let this happen."
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.160]   I don't think anybody knows.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.800]   He talks about it in his memoirs, "How Close," but I remember talking to him about it.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.000]   How close we came.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.840]   And I feel like cyber warfare has the, it's not as bad as nuclear warfare.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.720]   You're not going to get a scorched earth.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.000]   But if it escalates, we are--
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I feel like it's a little more corrosive in some ways.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   We're living on the edge.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.080]   We have five days of food, our financial system, our electrical grid, all of its problems.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.440]   If you take a look at how things unraveled in the early days of the shutdown in 2020,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.520]   that did expose a lot of weaknesses in how the US and the companies that live and work
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.720]   in the US have chosen to structure a like supply chains in transit.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.160]   But if you do a little bit of reading, and one of the things I would love to recommend
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.520]   to everybody who's listening or watching this, Brad Smith, who is a president at Microsoft
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:56.480]   and it's Chief Counsel, wrote a fantastic book a couple of years ago that has-- it's
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.520]   basically a primer for what's going on right now.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.320]   And it's called tools and weapons, the promise and peril of the digital age.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.040]   And in a couple of chapters, he lays out the surveillance that Microsoft as a private
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.840]   company has been doing on the Russian government for years because Russia State sponsored agency
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.680]   has been doing things like trying to register domains that it can pass off as Microsoft
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.320]   domains to capture user information, sift through it, and then use it to break into places.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.240]   Senator Worfer has proven super effective in some ways already.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   And you take a look at the election, 2016, 2020.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.920]   You take a look at the Senate elections in 2018.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.440]   There was evidence of interference there too.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.320]   And we did include this link later in the show, but Russian meme factories and disinformation
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.160]   campaigns have been super effective throughout the pandemic as well.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.120]   When we're talking about siloed realities, where people get together based on affinity
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:01.680]   rather than geographic connections or even a sense of national thing, that weakens a nation.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.800]   And it's been super successful so far.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.640]   After seeing how poorly-- surprisingly, poorly Russia's fared in Ukraine.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.520]   I feel like that maybe they will turn to this cyber war, where even a small nation like
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.760]   say North Korea can hire enough hackers to be really disruptive in the world.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.160]   We've got China, we've got North Korea, we've got Russia.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.800]   I hope I assume that we have capabilities, similar capabilities in the United States,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.440]   but I would also hope that we would be careful about using those because of the risk to civilian
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   populations.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:43.560]   Well, that's the flip side of cyber warfare, is it affects civilians on such a greater
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.800]   scale and in ways I don't think anyone who hasn't been part of it can wrap their brains
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.880]   around because it can affect everything from your ability to hit your bank balance to
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.160]   whether or not you have money in retirement, to whether or not you're able to get gas,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.600]   to whether or not you're able to have the power on.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.720]   It's an astonishing scope compared to street to street geographic warfare where people
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.560]   have the option to flee.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:15.600]   We live in such a heavily networked international economy at this point that there will be people
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.400]   affected all over the place who are nowhere near where the fighting is.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:26.960]   If you were to take this to a purely computer networked or a data first fighting angle.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:36.640]   Atlantic had an article that talked about a 1993 Rand memo, a Rand report, called, this
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:42.240]   is 1993, remember, cyber war is coming, exclamation mark.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.480]   The authors, I'll read you a little bit of it, the thesis of this think piece is that the
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.880]   information revolution will cause shifts both in how societies may come into conflict and
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.160]   how their armed forces may wage war.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:03.960]   They talk about cyber war, which is the kind of warfare we're talking about bringing down
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.360]   a power grid or bringing down the water system, both of which, by the way, Russia has already
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.560]   done to Ukraine and what looks like a test of their capabilities.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.800]   They also talk about net war.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.920]   We don't use that term nowadays, we call it disinformation.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.920]   Societal level, ideational conflicts waged in part through internet nodes of communication.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.320]   This was written in 93 before there was a Facebook, before there was a Twitter, before
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.520]   there were these mass disinformation campaigns.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:40.440]   These guys really understood how this could be used against a population.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.760]   They say that one of the reasons the Nazis had such successes because Joseph Gebel's
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:52.000]   the minister propaganda understood and used radio, the new technology of radio so effectively.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.040]   It could very well be that a country that doesn't, Russia's, it's got an economy the
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   size of Texas.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.000]   It does have nukes, but it also, you don't have to be this great economic power to have
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.320]   a very powerful cyber army in effect.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.160]   Georgia, tell us something to reassure us.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.480]   Please.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.240]   Well, my thought is like really they, you have to do something.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.160]   You can't allow countries to just invade.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   I agree.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   It's terrific.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.920]   It's great to be okay and if you don't want to get your people directly involved in a
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   war, then you have to find other ways that are going to be able to stop this as quickly
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.440]   as possible with the least amount of people lives lost.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.760]   I think that attacking their infrastructure through the internet is probably a safer bet
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.640]   than bringing people in.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:54.000]   The fact that anyone uses the fact that they have nukes as a shield, that is, you know,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   terrific.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.840]   But of course they're going to do that.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.880]   They're going to do that for anything.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.560]   They want to make this as fast and effective as possible to be able to take over as much
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.960]   land as they can.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.680]   So I think that they should put every single card that they have.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.800]   That would be the safest and that would, you know, just be able to shut it down as quickly
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   as possible.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.680]   So I think that if they can do that through, you know, just shutting down the internet,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.280]   like, you know, that will be a better option than having to send in troops and it might
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   be more effective.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.840]   I just worry that we, if whatever we do can be responded to and, you know, they're already
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   doing that.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   Like, let's just say it.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.400]   Like they're not, they've already, like, Russia's already threatened nukes.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.680]   So like it's not like they wouldn't choose to do this anyways.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.840]   Like, you know, like nukes, oh, and we'll shut down your internet and then everyone's
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.000]   like, oh, okay, now we'll stop.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.720]   Like, you know, I mean, the economy is going to collapse tomorrow.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.120]   No, they're turning off swift.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.960]   So you don't, and they just said, and there was just something that came out that said,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.800]   Russia has just made it so that if you are a foreign investor in Russian markets, you
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.440]   can't exactly pull your money out of the Russian market right now.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.200]   So that's the action of a government that knows there's a huge run on banks today.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.000]   There's going to be no more money to Monday is going to be crazy.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.080]   Well, money will be Monday soon in Russia, actually.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:23.480]   And you know, they've got no airspace, they're effectively being fenced in.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.320]   So they're going to be cut off from the internet.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.240]   They're going to be cut off financially.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.960]   And since Putin's power rested primarily in flexing some financial muscle, all he has
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.600]   left to negotiate with are nukes.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.920]   But and again, not diminishing the terror.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.640]   And I just worry, you know, we not to mention the terror.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.440]   But I think you can't like this sounds awful.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.840]   The US has professionals back in the state department, and they've always had a deep
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.480]   bank of professionals and talent in the Pentagon.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:04.240]   And I would not be surprised if they haven't gained out all of the scenarios that are likely
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.880]   to happen and have figured out a way to let Putin say, or say, well, rattle about the nukes
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.040]   and say, fine, this is what he's going to negotiate with.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.160]   He has nothing else to negotiate with after that.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.400]   Or to threaten with and the US has plenty.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.200]   And we're not even officially involved yet.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.480]   So the banks opened in Moscow in about five hours.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.880]   Well, it'll be very interesting.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.840]   We shall see.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.080]   My fear is, you know, we have the thing that kept us from blowing each other up in the
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:37.760]   sixties was something called mutual assured destruction, mad, which was the threat that
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.720]   if you did it, they would do it back.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.160]   And we the whole world would blow up.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.360]   There is some deterrent that if we are too aggressive in pushing a cyber war against Moscow,
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.960]   that they will do it back to us.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.600]   I'm hoping, I know I wonder if there should be a Geneva convention.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.800]   There should be Geneva courts for cyber because Brad Smith, again, to get back to the recommendations
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.640]   I came in, Microsoft's Brad Smith has been traveling the world, giving a speech for the
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.880]   last six or seven years, arguing that what we need is a new digital Geneva convention.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   I think so.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:18.320]   So, which lays out the rights of every person in the world to be able to connect online with
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.600]   other people to transact business online with other people.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.920]   And most importantly, takes the responsibility for their own safety off of the shoulders
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.600]   of the individual and forces it onto the shoulders of government.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:40.840]   And he says, so another one, Microsoft or Microsoft or Google being responsible for
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:46.480]   your internet safety, it becomes something where governments are held accountable if you're
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   not safe online.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.120]   I think Putin has essentially escaped.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.720]   If harm is done to you, thanks to networked data.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.520]   Putin has essentially escaped responsibility for what I think we're starting to believe
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:06.160]   now really is, you know, at least tacitly a tacit approval of the ransomware epidemic.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:14.720]   This was back in 2017, I think that Smith talked about a digital Geneva convention, no
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:21.200]   targeting of tech companies, private sector or critical infrastructure, you know, and limit
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.720]   offensive operation to avoid a mass event, commit to non-proliferation activities to
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.040]   cyber weapons, exercise restraint and developing cyber weapons.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.120]   I don't think we are doing any of those things on our part because the other argument is
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.960]   the the mad argument, which is well operate from strength.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:46.520]   The only deterrent to somebody clearly a madman like Putin is to have enough strength to say,
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.480]   yeah, well, don't mess with us.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   Making poor.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   I mean, this is the thing.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   I agree.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.240]   You submitted everybody who was super comfortable with their with their yachts and their
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.880]   what's going to happen is all over Europe and their capacious Swiss bank account already
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.800]   when they lose their assets, they're going to agitate for change already.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.000]   Russian billionaires are saying, uh, yeah, we don't we're not going to lose their assets.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   We're not.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Okay, stop.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Okay, stop.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.800]   Oh, doctor, you want to weigh in on any of this?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.840]   You could say no, even that it's no.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.600]   It's just in a broad scope of an idea.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.320]   I'm against war in general.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:31.760]   Of course, it always amuses me how mighty and how high horse we get when it's something
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   we don't like.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.240]   But when America, oh, yeah, does things.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.480]   I'm just as mad when we do that to believe that.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.160]   I know we are, but I'm saying in general, I'm saying like I've been overseas when we
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.600]   were at war for decades and the rest of the country is looking to be like, Oh, you're
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   an American.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.040]   Like, you know what I mean?
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.680]   Like the concept of how we get so high in my idea, like, Oh, you want to do a cyborg?
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   Go ahead.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   Open Pandora's box.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.080]   The real problem is you can have a genocence and all you want to America has been caught
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.760]   in the past doing things that are criminal against international law and to think that
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:07.040]   Russia or any other agitator is going to listen to any kind of thing that you put out there.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.120]   That's what the CIA's for to ask with the government that like we don't negotiate with
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   terrorists.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.120]   Well, how did they get our weapons?
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120]   How did they get these trucks?
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.000]   All these things behind it.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.360]   I'm like, you're driving a US tank.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.600]   How did you get them?
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.280]   Because we make these deals behind closed doors and when it blows up on our face, we're
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.760]   like, Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   I didn't mean it.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.240]   I was trying to do this.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.480]   So when I listen to all these things, let's see what happens that they go broke tomorrow
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.160]   and figure it out from there.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:39.720]   But the whole, like, but I have to say, we have not yet invaded Mexico or Canada.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.000]   I wouldn't mind moving to Canada, but we haven't invaded.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.120]   So we haven't marched across the lines of a sovereign state.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120]   We've gotten involved in wars.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.600]   We should not have been in Vietnam, in Syria, in Afghanistan.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.560]   There's an old nation in the world that has military bases on every single continent.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.560]   All of that to protect.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.960]   That's for security.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.680]   But we want to allow anyone to have them here.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.160]   I hear what you're saying.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.520]   I'm just saying, we're the world.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.680]   The imperialism is, the imperialism runs big.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.160]   The imperialism runs big.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   Everywhere.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.040]   And I didn't hear all this excitement when Africa had genocide and nobody was helping
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.760]   them for decades on end.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.920]   I mean, those people were being ordered and people say, you know, where was you concerned
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   for the Uighurs?
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   I agree.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   But happy NATO finally doing something.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.400]   NATO has been nonexistent through anything in my lifetime that I can remember.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.720]   At least I see now that they're, they seem to be doing some things.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.440]   But I'm like, I just have a different concept of the whole global thing.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   Yes, it's wrong.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   Yes, we do things.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.000]   But you can open up that Pandora's box you want to.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.560]   It's just going to be a rough situation because it only takes five dudes in the closet to
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.520]   shut down the city or shut down a block.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.600]   That's the other thing that I think is interesting is warfare is completely different than it
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.440]   was even 20 years ago because of technology.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:02.040]   For instance, there's a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:09.640]   Jeffrey Lewis, who with his team of students was monitoring Google Maps, Google Maps in
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.160]   Ukraine.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   And before we even knew the invasion was happening, he knew because he could see on Google Maps
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.600]   road closures and the movements of Russian artillery from Russia into Ukraine because
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.240]   of Google Maps.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:34.120]   I mean, this is now there are independent people using satellite photos to identify Russian
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:40.000]   convoys tank movements by combining, I'm reading from the Washington Post, by combining Google
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.560]   Maps traffic information with a radar image that showed troops.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.960]   Lewis and his teams realized that invasion was underway hours before the news became
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:54.160]   public and from thousands of miles away in California.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:01.480]   So there technology, which is ubiquitous, technology is now the Palantir, the all-seeing
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.040]   eye that we all to some degree more or less have access to.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.240]   So this is, I think this changes things a little bit.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.120]   We are a little bit, look at the video we're getting.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.840]   It's a very different experience.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   Well, I think warfare changed when you had folks like Snowden and other people who chose
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.960]   to share information during a war and could disseminate that information quickly along
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.760]   multiple nodes.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.560]   Like there was no way to shut it down to disappear somebody.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.920]   What is the name of that young woman?
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.520]   She's got that really great first name.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   Reality winner.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.400]   I almost said that and I thought, is that who she's talking about?
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   She does have a great first name.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   Well, there's that.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.080]   There was Snowden.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.800]   The minute it occurred to people that they could dump information on the internet and
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.320]   let folks pick it apart and do what they would, that dramatically changed warfare, especially
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:08.160]   when you contrast it with how information was guarded through World War II, through all
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:14.680]   of the US's many, many, many, many imperialist skirmishes after that.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:22.040]   We don't have that kind of presumption of a cone of silence around intelligence anymore.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   And that's a big thing.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Very interesting.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.840]   Because wars are won and lost on intelligence.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.240]   I mean, you could argue that getting ahold of the Enigma machine is what won World War
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   II.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   Right.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:38.120]   You could also, and by the way, it's interesting because the vice premier of Ukraine is talking
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.280]   and he tweeted that he wants hackers to come on over and help him.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.800]   But then he asked them to do it on Telegram and somebody should have explained to him.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:53.040]   Signal might be a better choice in that case.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:01.280]   So I'm not sure why Russia didn't completely shut down the internet in Ukraine.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   Usually when you invade a country, at least it's been my experience, in the old days you
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.040]   shut down the newspapers, radio stations, you shut down the communication media.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.520]   Well, you remember they shut down Eastonians internet.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.160]   And I didn't do that in Ukraine.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.160]   I'm not sure why not.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.640]   Well, I think everybody learned from it.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   Maybe it was Harlan.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   Maybe they could.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.240]   You know what they are doing?
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.600]   They're shutting down Twitter and Facebook in Russia because they don't want their own
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.160]   people seeing what's going on.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:34.800]   Seeing what's going on, which is telling.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   Harlan Musk says we're...
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.400]   I don't think Russian people want war.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   I mean...
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   No, I think not.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.720]   In fact, I think the best hope for peace at this point is that they overthrow Putin,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.800]   which would come at a great...
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.080]   I'm sure a great bloodshed and loss to Russian lives.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   I don't know.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   I don't know.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.240]   It's hard to say we live in such unusual times.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.880]   I think that's what Putin is afraid of.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.520]   In fact, that's what happened in Ukraine.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.040]   Putin had a strong man in there.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:03.200]   Remember he was horrifically corrupt, had built this palatial mansion and there was
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   a revolution.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   He threw him out.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   He fled to Russia.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.960]   He's still living in Russia.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.320]   Zelensky was elected.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   And that's exactly...
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.560]   That was the scenario I think Putin was most afraid of is exactly that.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.480]   Apple Pay is unavailable in Russia.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.960]   Now we're talking hardship.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.520]   No Google Pay, no Apple Pay.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.760]   One Ukrainian leader...
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.480]   This puts Apple in an interesting bind.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:39.240]   One Ukrainian leader to call on Tim Cook to block Russian users from the App Store.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.880]   What do you do if you're Apple or Google?
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.840]   You pull out of Russia?
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.640]   That's a slippery slope.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.800]   Again, we've been at war for as long as I can remember.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.080]   I didn't agree with those wars.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.680]   You're going to turn off my internet or my service because the government wants to go
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.960]   do what they want to do.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.360]   I didn't get drafted.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.560]   I didn't sign up.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560]   I didn't play.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:06.120]   He is a regular citizen who now is struggling, economically struggling for food and all the
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.800]   necessities I need just to keep my family safe and alive.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.840]   Now I came in and down a little happy flabby birds.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.200]   It's about to give me through tonight.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.480]   I'm making the talk about it.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.640]   As a regular citizen, they shouldn't get involved.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.640]   They should leave it alone.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.960]   Again, it's a very slippery slope when you start getting into what you should shut down
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.520]   and what you should not, especially when we get so mad and so upset about things like
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520]   TikTok.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.200]   People don't like TikTok because America didn't make TikTok.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.000]   When you look at the way that they use the platform in other countries versus here, I
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   get it.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   There's manipulation.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.360]   There's games, but it's not up to them to change things and shut things down for the
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.920]   regular common people.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.000]   If you want to shut down Putin's account, sure.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   You got his number.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.640]   I'm sure he's logged into the App Store.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.760]   Shut him down directly.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.160]   No flappy happy birds for him.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   Okay.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:07.800]   Michaela Fethrowov, who is the Ukrainian, I think he's the deputy, let me get his title,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.520]   Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine, Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.320]   He's been very active on Twitter calling on, he's the guy who called on Apple to shut
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.880]   down the App Store.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:25.360]   He asked for help from Elon Musk, who said, "Okay, Starlink Service is now active in
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   Ukraine.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.040]   More terminals on route."
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.360]   Talk about instant response, right?
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:39.600]   He's called on YouTube to turn off monetization of Russia today.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.320]   They did.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.520]   He's the one who said, "We're creating an IT army.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.600]   We need digital talents.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.520]   All operational tasks will be given here on Telegram.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.480]   IT army of you reign.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.160]   I don't know why you are AI-NE, but I checked.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.560]   That's the actual address.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.960]   There will be tasks for everyone.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.200]   We continue to fight on the cyber front.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.840]   The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.960]   This is really interesting how important cyber warfare is becoming this.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.240]   Twitter just made the decision to block Russians, the opportunity to register new accounts in
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   the Russian Federation.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:21.520]   Then, of course, the Russians are telling you by shutting Twitter down.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.760]   Ukraine's asking for Bitcoin donations.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   cryptocurrency donations.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:32.720]   Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Tether, he posted the wallet addresses for the three.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.600]   Russia may be forced to rely on Bitcoin.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.800]   If now that Swift is shut down, the banks are getting cut off.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.240]   Bitcoin may be the only hope for Russia.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.000]   Crazy.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.840]   War is such a weird thing, right?
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.040]   Because at the end of it, you always go back and look at the finances, what military company
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.360]   built all the bases who made all the ammunition.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.160]   When you're Russia and you cut off all their money, no matter how they get money, who are
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.000]   you going to pay to do anything?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.080]   Because if you need something, this is like here, we had to make stuff, we had to do things
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   on our own.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.320]   If they're doing things, they don't need to pay anybody.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.480]   They're just taking over companies and small businesses, like, "Yo, go make us a car, a
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.640]   tank, a plane, or ammunition."
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.800]   I don't feel like they're going to be paying anybody to try and fund their war.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.320]   It's just a weird game to be playing.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.000]   Like I said, tomorrow, we're going to find out how economically strong the rest of things
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   they are.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Because Bitcoin ain't going to save them.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   I'd say that right now.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.760]   There's going to be a whole lot of people siphoning money into your own bank account,
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.240]   so they go pay for a new tank or a new plane.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.080]   I imagine there'll be a run on the banks.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   I would guess.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   I don't know.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   Yes, already a run on the banks.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   They're already dealing with the money.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   They're already running out.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.880]   That's where it sounds terrifying.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:56.760]   That's where shutting down, if people in Russia get angry enough to say, "You know what?
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.600]   This is affecting me and we're really upset."
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:06.280]   It may make Putin think twice about what he's doing and perhaps decide to go into negotiations
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.800]   with a little bit more seriousness.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.640]   If people can't get their flappy bird and they're angry enough, and then Putin's like,
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.760]   "Oh, wait a second.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.320]   This might create."
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.240]   The only thing that he cares about is his own power and being able to take as much control
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.520]   as he can as quickly as possible.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.000]   If the people in Russia are angry enough because they don't get flappy bird, well, maybe they'll
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   put a little bit more pressure and maybe Putin will be like, "Mm, they can't get flappy
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   bird.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.440]   Now it's serious because that's what's going to cause pressure to him."
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.280]   He's expecting this to be like he thought going into this that this was going to be regular
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.880]   warfare, but someone's doing a country and it's not the people they don't deserve this.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.640]   I'm fully aware of that.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.880]   But it's a small price in comparison to how many lives it could save if we end up being
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:55.040]   able to shut down so that then they decide to negotiate a little bit sooner.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   In and where it really hurts.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:04.760]   Where the people, Fedorov, we've also asked Netflix to block the Russian Federation access
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.120]   to Netflix.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   Now that hurts.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.440]   I think it's a small price.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.000]   No, isn't it a small price to save lives?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Yes.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   It could really, again, when people get frustrated, unfortunately we're so short-sighted as humans
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.800]   that we really only care when it affects us.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.200]   Like other people, we see other bad things happening to other people, we're like, "That's
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   horrible for them."
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.800]   But we don't usually think about it.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.840]   When it starts to affect us, we're like, "Oh, wait a second.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.240]   I can't get flappy birds.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   Now I'm upset.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.440]   Let's do something and you better stop."
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.440]   All right.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.960]   Anyway, just kind of a rundown of some of the tech stories.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.800]   Also, we talked with Rod Pyle.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.480]   There's also the issue at the International Space Station, which is half owned by Russia.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.880]   It's supplied by Russia.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.760]   Rockets launched from Russian territory.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.520]   There's some real legitimate concern.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.720]   NASA says, "Man, don't worry about it."
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:10.800]   I would hope that Roscosmos, the Russian NASA, would act as if this is a non-political issue.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:17.400]   But in fact, the director of Roscosmos has already started to do a little saber rattling.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.320]   They've suspended Soyuz rocket launches.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:28.640]   He's saying, "We're going to withdraw our staff from the Guiana Space Center where the
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.880]   Soyuz rockets are launched."
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.320]   I don't know how this will affect the ISS, but it's pretty serious.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.880]   Rod was very concerned about this.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.240]   I'm not worried about that at all.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.640]   We have the Space Force.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:50.960]   I don't think Steve Carell is going to save us here.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.320]   I know our last president said it in place.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   We have a space force.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.000]   We really do have a space force.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   That's real.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   That's right.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   I'm so out to all seriousness.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.840]   We don't need to be worried about it.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   We got the space force.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840]   Does that get us in?
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   Have a space force.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:10.320]   By the way, that is another place.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.400]   That is another place I do not want, you know, bad enough to have cyber warfare and collateral
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   damage.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.120]   Let's not start a war in space.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.520]   Let's not start a war in space.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.720]   We can start a war in space.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.520]   We're the only ones with space force.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.800]   I'm the only one with my own space.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.640]   Come up here if you want to.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.040]   We're the only ones with space force.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.560]   I want the space force pin that looks just like the Star Trek pin.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.240]   Lisa, your internet is, I think, Lisa's frozen.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.320]   I don't think she would hold that look for very long.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.160]   Thank goodness it's a good look.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.440]   Whenever I'm worried about being frozen, I'm like, just make sure it's not like while
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.920]   I'm opening my mouth really wide.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   It's always bad look.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.280]   In fact, shut it down for me if that happens.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.520]   I used to take great pleasure in freezing CNN at the worst possible time.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.320]   Always trying to get Anderson Cooper in a compromising pose.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   Go ahead, Lisa.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   I think your internet's back.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   Oh, we'll see.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   Maybe not.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.800]   This will be a good time to streak, Uncle Leo.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.720]   She has moved into a new position.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   He can come back and like, unless you really shock.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.400]   This will, the streak is in our job, Uncle Leo.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.080]   Not all of that kind of streak.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.280]   Yes, our sponsors streak.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   I went there too.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.640]   Yeah, I was going to take off my clothes.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.480]   Don't look at me like that, Ellen.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.600]   Don't look at me like that.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   It's your fault.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.680]   Actually, they must have known you guys are going to be on the show when they decided
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.800]   to sponsor this episode of this weekend tech.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.040]   Our show today brought to you by streak.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.840]   Streak is a CRM built for Gmail.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.520]   If you use Gmail, you will love streak.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.640]   Imagine running your business from your inbox.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.880]   Well, you probably already are, right?
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.080]   Mail is everything, but wouldn't it be nice to have a CRM that integrates with your Gmail
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:04.600]   inbox and helps you keep track of sales or fundraising or hire or support or whatever
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.800]   you're doing all your processes without leaving Gmail.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.960]   Streak's free email tools will help you check if emails have been opened, send bulk emails
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:19.000]   with automated follow-ups to improve your response rate, and all of this without leaving
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.480]   Gmail, all part of your everyday workflow.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.280]   You can see details about your leads, your customers, your investors right next to your
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.280]   email.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   And by the way, Google loves this.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.840]   They were recognized as Google's technology partner of the year.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.640]   Streak is beloved by thousands of founders and entrepreneurs and small business owners
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:43.120]   who have discovered this is the way to operate, the way to do business.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.560]   No more switching between Gmail and other tools keep track of everything going on in
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.240]   your business, whether you're prospecting for new customers or you're raising another
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   round of funding or growing your team or managing support tickets.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.960]   The whole thing comes down to streak what they call pipelines.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   Pipelines are brilliant.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.400]   What a brilliant way to manage mail.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.880]   Track all your processes directly from Gmail.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   It's easy.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.880]   You'll be setting up your first pipeline.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.840]   You'll get it immediately in just a couple of minutes.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.440]   And then you customize the pipelines based on your needs like filters on steroids.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.720]   It's incredible.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   You can collaborate.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.560]   It makes it very easy to automatically share emails, share notes.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.400]   It's a brilliant, brilliant idea.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.840]   I think you're going to love streak and great news is free to use on your own.

[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   Miss Meissure.

[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.520]   Are we okay in there?
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.960]   She's still frozen?
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.600]   She reconnected and froze immediately.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.640]   Yeah, tap it a little harder.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.320]   Does that work?
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   Percussive maintenance.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.480]   That's the way that we handle most of our tech problems.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.720]   So are you good at Elden Ring, Georgia?
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   Are you good at it?
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.600]   Am I good at it?
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.000]   Um, in a short answer, no.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.640]   In a long answer, no.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.360]   I really want to play it.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.160]   I'm not good at it.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.160]   It's just a button config.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.080]   I think that if I had more practice at a button config that was similar to it, I wouldn't be
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.840]   drinking potions instead of slashing with the sword.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.680]   That's my biggest issue with that is that suddenly I'm like hit, hit, hit, but I've
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   actually just drank.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   It's such a hard game.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.840]   I've been watching Twitchers.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.600]   A lot of these people on Twitch are really good at games and I've been watching them die
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.320]   and die again.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.200]   Fortunately, as you pointed out, when you get clobbered, I hate to use the word die.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.880]   When your character gets biffed in the game, you don't lose anything.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.400]   You can just go back.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.200]   You just lose some of the cash rewards, the stuff that you can do.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.200]   The drops.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.600]   Which is not horrible.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.160]   This is the game that came out on Thursday.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.520]   Everybody's been talking about it.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:40.840]   It is so hard that the creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki, says, "I apologize if you're frustrated."
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.200]   You don't send him tweets.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.520]   I'm so sorry.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.200]   The Dark Souls games, if you've ever played those, they're widely known.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.640]   I've never played because I watch Michael, our 19-year-old play.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.120]   It looks like a lot of fun.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.440]   It's all about bosses.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.240]   It looks like a lot of fun.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.440]   It's so hard.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.080]   I've always known it's too hard for me, but I did buy it because I really wanted to do
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.080]   it.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.160]   Believe it or not, the New Yorker had a whole interview with Miyazaki.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   He says, "Death is a feature, not a bug."
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.080]   That sounds so beautiful.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.400]   If you look at it like that, if you look at it like that, but it's just a challenge that
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.400]   you're going to...
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.640]   If you go into the game knowing that you are going to die a thousand times, and that that's
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.000]   just you're there to learn.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.640]   I guess it could be a good way of dealing with resilience, learning to get back on it.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   There you go.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.960]   Six times get up seven.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.640]   That could be the learning curve that you have to go through when you're playing algebraing.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:54.000]   But if you look at algebraing and you play it that way, it's frustrating because you're
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.880]   doing the same thing very repetitively over and over again.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.200]   There are ways to beat bosses.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:05.720]   I've seen people that are beating bosses that are way above where their skill levels are.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.920]   People can be amazing at it.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   And that's the other thing.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.840]   It is fun to watch somebody who's good at this because you have to dodge and parry and
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.880]   roll and jump and time.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:21.920]   A lot of it looks like that you have to really understand the boss's attack sequence so that
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.800]   you know when your moment has come.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   You also have to be very...
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.280]   My problem is I'm too impatient.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.960]   I just go in there and they go, "Boom!"
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.120]   And it's over.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.040]   You have to be patient.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.680]   This is from the New Yorker article about Miyazaki.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.920]   The video game director who's in his late 40s has punished more players than perhaps
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.480]   anyone else.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.520]   In Dark Souls, the 2011 fantasy game that made him famous, you play as a loin-clothed
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:54.600]   wretch, racing through sewers, and cowering in forests.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:51:01.360]   You're attacked by a giant wolf, pugilist mushrooms, methytic swamps, and a sword-wielding
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.520]   spider.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:07.640]   If you fail to parry an aggressor's lunge or tumble off a rampart, you're greeted by
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.880]   a superfluous message.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.600]   You died.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.640]   After it fades, you're reincarnated beside a bonfire.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.560]   One of a series of checkpoints scattered throughout this mysterious vaguely medieval
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.640]   world.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:25.120]   Of course, every one of your enemies has respawn as well.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.360]   You know, I'm glad the New Yorker...
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.880]   We finally got the New Yorker treatment for a video game.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.920]   I think this is very good.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.120]   Are you in the discord, Uncle Leo?
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120]   I can be.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.120]   I can.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   What are they?
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.120]   Oh, stop that.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.120]   Stop that.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   What are they doing?
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.800]   They're posting pictures of me in a flowery grave.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.640]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.280]   This is, by the way, this is me playing Elden Ring.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   That's how you set it up at home.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   There's an elf.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   I'm so confused.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:00.120]   I just put it in a video to scroll down to the bottom, not that it's out.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.760]   And it's a YouTube video.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.960]   It's a guy who talks about how hard video games are, Asian video games are.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.880]   You just have to let it play for like a minute.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.880]   So like...
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.040]   He says, Asian is a difficulty mode.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.280]   Okay, this is not racist though, right?
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.120]   You're not going to make me play...
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.120]   No, it's...
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.440]   Everyone understands how it moves.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.280]   He steps on a twig and dies immediately.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.480]   Yes, steps on a bridge.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   Step to unbranch.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.040]   And in the next one, he'll be...
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.320]   He's like, "Wait, what?"
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.080]   So long story short, it's like, breathe air.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:37.120]   And then once it gets to a minute, his character dies and the reason is emotional damage.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   And he's like...
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.200]   I'm emotional damage.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.240]   Like it just comes more ridiculous.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   Some people...
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   Explain this.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.440]   He actually says there's an Asian mode.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.640]   Some people like really, really hard video games.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   Why is that?
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.320]   Do you know, Georgia, do you have an explanation for that?
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   It's...
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.400]   One is that it makes them feel like they can do things that other people can't, just like
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.040]   people that do extreme sports.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.000]   It causes that adrenaline rush.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.200]   And then you get this huge dopamine hit.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.800]   So the harder it is to accomplish something, the bigger your brain rewards you for being
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.120]   able to do it.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.440]   And so building that kind of resiliency and that delay of gratification is one, it's
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.840]   actually really good for us.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.840]   Like to be able to do that is...
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.080]   Is it the modern day marshmallow test?
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.520]   It's the marshmallow that kills you first.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   Yes.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.560]   It's kind of like the modern test.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.480]   I have a question about that.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.000]   Would it be...
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.840]   Is it because the difficulty puts you kind of in a flow state where you can tune out
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:44.960]   everything else and you're so thoroughly engaged that that gives you some satisfaction?
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.080]   I love that you mentioned flow state, which is like a really cool thing.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.360]   So flow state is when you lose time and space, nothing else matters and you're just vibing.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.800]   It's just you and whatever you are doing.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.200]   And like hours could go by and it feels like minutes.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.760]   Now for me, I am definitely not in a flow state when I play Aldrin's, but I have heard
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.480]   from a lot of other people that they are, that it doesn't even bother them that they've
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   died.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.160]   They're just gaining information and learning how to do something better.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.200]   And so yes, they can be in that flow state while they're playing this really horrible
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   game.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:24.160]   And not in that state, I am feeling frustrated and angry.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   Yes.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.600]   So I have not reached that level of gaming capacity in the building.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   It's irritating.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.640]   I don't want to feel bad.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   I feel bad about me.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.200]   It makes me feel bad about myself and my competency, right?
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   Go ahead.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.560]   Owen's raising his hand.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.120]   As a doctor myself, can I say...
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   Please, Owen.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.880]   You're a podcast doctor, but okay, I'll take it.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.040]   He plays a doctor on TV.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:54.720]   First of all, in 2010, I was over Dr. Oz and Dr. Phil in the Apple podcast store.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:59.240]   I had real doctors reaching out to me, not understanding why I was number one in the
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   podcast.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.760]   I am a doctor as my professional, not realistically professional opinion, as I was about to say.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.720]   We call that the zone, okay?
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   Being in the zone.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   You call...
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   You know, fans, people call it the flow.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.720]   We call it the zone.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.560]   Yeah, basketball players hit the zone, football players hit the zone.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.200]   And then just the flows.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.960]   And then let me finish what I'm saying.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.880]   Secondly, it's the same reason I don't subscribe to participation trophies.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.560]   The same reason I blocked every shot that Lee tried to put up against me.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.080]   I didn't give her nothing.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   Because guess what?
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.880]   She cried about it the first eight times.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.320]   And when she finally made a bucket on her own, the joy of actually succeeding was beyond
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.320]   all compare.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.120]   I raised her and her friends as a genius that I am.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.760]   I raised them at four years old.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   I beat them down.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   I raised them at five years old.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   I raised them at eight.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.320]   Well, my legs are still bigger than theirs.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   I beat them.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.640]   Today, they still talk about how fast I am.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.760]   No matter how rotund I am, they remember me beating them down on the leg race.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.640]   And I am the fastest man on earth compared to their children.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.040]   So it's all about succeeding, but you got to go through the trials and tribulations
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.040]   first.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   Leah had a karate contest.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.040]   She didn't practice.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.520]   I tore eight, but to practice, she gets up there.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.960]   She got a little rinky dick coin and all the kids got a big trophy that won.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.960]   She started crying.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   She said, "Why don't I get what else?"
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   I said, "Well, you should have been practicing.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.960]   You got to earn it."
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.960]   So that's what the games were.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   What is hard?
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   You get to earn it.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   All the joy when you're in.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   When you play on easy, you don't even feel good about yourself.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.240]   You're like, "Man, look, I ain't leading by watching.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   I guess I'll put on easy.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.440]   You don't feel good about it."
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.440]   When you're on medium slash hard, all the success, the small victories, the joys of
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.440]   belief, the zone.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.800]   As it were, my professional opinion.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.840]   I believe Leah learned that lesson because she went back and she's a champion, isn't
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   she?
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   Champion wrestler.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.840]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.840]   She is.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:40.920]   She's out to pay some point in that too.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:46.280]   So she went, she won her little first girl to win the championship thing in the tournament.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.400]   Beginning the season, start off great.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.400]   End of the season, she had regionals.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.800]   When you're in, losing your out.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   She lost this girl.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   This girl was jacked.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.200]   And I mean, like the girl's in bed and her, but she was stronger than her.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.520]   Natalie is in here eating protein shakes, lifting after school every day.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.160]   Like she's out here riding my spin bike.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.560]   Like she's like, "I got to get weights."
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:09.200]   So that motivation of when something you have to work for and earn is what does it.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.240]   Whether it's in sports or video games or shoot, even starting a business.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.040]   Sometimes it doesn't work out, but you got to keep at it.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.280]   So you know, you're little important.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.960]   You own an empire out there, San Fran.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   Just go bathe.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   Adjacent.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.520]   That's why I've been doing the thumb exercises, the four finger exercises.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   I'm getting ready for Elden Ring.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.080]   I know it's uncomfortable.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.240]   I know it's difficult, but I will prevail.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.840]   You're what I consider retirement.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.640]   Okay, you're just, you're just about having fun talking about you.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.400]   You're saying your dexterity will not allow you to win.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   No.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   I got no twitch.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   No, no.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.240]   I mean, watch the kid play.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.880]   We'll put the movie on and it's like watching a movie when they're playing it.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   When a kid's good.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:59.440]   So many years ago, I interviewed a guy named Mahaly Chichamente-Haly who is...
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.920]   Did you really?
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   Yes.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   He wrote the...
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.920]   That is the coolest thing.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.920]   Yes.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   And this was before...
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   I was probably only other therapists are like, "Oh my God."
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.920]   And everyone's like, "Who did he?"
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.320]   Before anybody ever talked about flow, he wrote a book called Flow.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   There he is at his TED Talk back in 2004 that described this state and he said, "It's
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.760]   what makes life worth living."
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.760]   And I'll never forget it.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.280]   I mean, it was very interesting.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.320]   He's a very interesting fellow.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:31.400]   But me, even though I'd never heard anybody use this phrase, the zone or flow before, I
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.440]   immediately got what he was talking about.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:40.840]   And we all have some experience of the world disappears and you're just focused.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:48.480]   And I remember in acting you do these exercises to bring up your energy, but it's not uncontained
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   energy.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.480]   You want to bring your energy up but seem relaxed at the same time.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.480]   And it's flow.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:00.760]   It's the centered flow where you have the energy, but it's contained.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:07.320]   So I think if anybody can experience it, I don't know if this Elden Ring is exactly the
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.880]   key to flow.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.480]   But I guess if you're really good at it, you probably are.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.200]   Or if you don't mind dying and you just enjoy being immersed in something, there's all
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:23.240]   kinds of unusual activities that some people might find flow in and really be able to enjoy
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.240]   it.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.600]   And interestingly enough, for anxiety levels, when you hit flow, your levels of anxiety
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   go down.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   It's soothing.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.960]   Like you're just in a zone and your levels of dopamine and opiates, you feel just really
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.160]   good and usually more energized afterwards, as long as you're eating and drinking and
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.400]   doing all the other things that you need to do as well.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.840]   You don't want to get lost in it because some people can do a full activity and then
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.480]   they're just gone and didn't pay their taxes.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:57.800]   But there's also a somewhat more negative mechanic going on, kind of the Skinnerian,
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.320]   you know, Skinner Box mechanic where you're punished and punished and punished and then
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.280]   you beat this boss.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.360]   And you even mentioned this.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:11.200]   There's this high of success, just like the, like you gamble when you go to the tables and
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.800]   you lose and you lose news.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.520]   The worst thing that can happen to you in Las Vegas is winning because then you want
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.480]   to get that again.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.440]   And there's also that mechanic, isn't it?
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.600]   It's not just flow.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.680]   It's also this mechanic of, I want that endorphin rush that I got when I killed the boss last
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680]   time.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.480]   See, I think there's a really great chapter.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   Sorry.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   All of us want to talk.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.880]   Any, any money Mo, you start Lisa and then I'll let Georgia and then I'll let Owen.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.880]   How about that?
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.600]   There's a really beautiful chapter in John crack hours into the wild.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   Are you guys familiar with that book?
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   Oh, love that book.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.040]   It's about, he tries to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless who gained notoriety
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.480]   for starving to death in a bus in the Alaskan wilderness under circumstances that were mostly
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.760]   preventable.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.440]   Not here to litigate that whole thing right now because there's, it's ongoing.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:11.080]   But he has a beautiful chapter where he describes talking about hiking the, I'm going to mess
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.040]   with the pronunciation because I've only ever read the, the sticky, the stikene ice cap
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:22.280]   and crack hour describes the brutal process of inching up and placing your feet very carefully
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.760]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.680]   what he talks about is how, quote unquote, a translate, a translate, a translate, like
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   state settles over your efforts.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.320]   The accumulated clutter of day to day existence, the lapse of conscience, the unpaid bills,
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.280]   all of it is temporarily forgotten, crowded from your thoughts by the overpowering clarity
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.440]   of purpose and by the seriousness of task at hand.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.800]   And then he ends the chapter by pointing out that like once you've achieved this great
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:53.600]   thing, quote unquote, the climb is over, the only place to go is down and listening to
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.080]   you guys talk about the same, the, the emotional intensity of being able to master this really
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.520]   tough task and having the joy of dropping into the moment and feeling that purpose,
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.360]   fullness and that accomplishment.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.320]   And then when it's done, you're like, ah, rat lever, press the lever again.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.840]   Like that's the flip side to that, that, that beautiful moment of knowing yourself and
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.680]   in intense focus and purposefulness is, is it just it ends.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.880]   I interviewed the game.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   It's the same thing.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.400]   I interviewed crack hour in 96 after he wrote his book about Everest into Sydney.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400]   It's an air.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.880]   Oh, incredible, incredible story.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.520]   And you know, I was thinking about that Netflix has a show called 14 Peaks, which if you haven't
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   seen it is worth watching.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:44.080]   It's a documentary about, you know, all of the people who summit Everest, going back
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.280]   to Sir Edmund Hillary really did it because they had Nepalese Sherpa, who did it for them
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.760]   or helped them or led the way or set the lines.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.700]   And these, these Sherpa never get the credit they deserve.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.800]   It's always Edmund Hillary at the press conference, not tanks, ignore gay, his Sherpa.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   So 14 Peaks is about a Sherpa, a Nepalese, an Nepali, a Mountaineer who wanted to do
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.040]   it for the Sherpa to get the credit for the Sherpa.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.080]   And he did something no one has ever done before.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.240]   In seven months, he summited all 14 of the world's 8,000 meter peaks.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.640]   And it is harrowing, but it's fascinating.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:35.240]   I, you know, I suspect that he also does it for the zone, that moment of leaving the world's
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.560]   cares behind.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.880]   And boy, he must feel that let down when he gets down because he went right back up and
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.040]   went right back up and went right back up.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.520]   Of course, once you finish 14 Peaks in seven months, then you're really going to have a
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.520]   let down.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:57.280]   Great story and a lot of credit goes to Nimzdai Puja, who is the Sherpa who did all 14 Peaks
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   in seven months.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.960]   I got to figure out how to write a book on how to control that, right?
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.080]   Because if you could turn it on and off, growing up when I was younger, I lived a life
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.520]   where I had everything really well off and then we were poor and then I had everything
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.720]   again and then I was middle ground.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.080]   And so when I turned 21, I went to Lang City for the $1,000 on black.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.760]   I hit it for the next five years every year of my birthday.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.760]   I went down there and I hit it.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.760]   I doubled my money.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.680]   I walked out didn't bet on anything else.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680]   Wow.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.600]   The sixth year I lost, I never played again.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.880]   I went out to Vegas with my buddies for a bachelor party where waiting in line to check
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880]   in our hotel.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.040]   I put a quarter in the slot.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   I want $800.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.480]   I didn't gamble a dollar the rest of the week.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.680]   I was there and everybody was like, yo, you're like, you're hot.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.800]   I was like, look, bro, I made my money.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.200]   I didn't hit this thing, shut it down.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.240]   You're a rare individual though.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.640]   Most people can't do that.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.400]   I know when I hear that, I hear that all the time to them, like, man, people just chase
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   the high.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   I'm like, man, I had the high.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400]   That was great.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.400]   Cool.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.600]   And once the high goes away or something messes it up, like I said, once I lost, I haven't
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   put it, I haven't got it.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.800]   Literally, I walk in the casino, put the $1,000 down.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.920]   I mean, I watched the boards and I picked my one and get my feel.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.160]   But as soon as I hit it, I take that money, I walk out.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.560]   And the one year when I lost, I haven't done it again.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   I'm up like $6,000.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.160]   I'm like, I'm good.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.040]   That quarter, there's nothing better than I'm going to do in Las Vegas than put a quarter
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.880]   in the slot and one almost $2,000.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.040]   No matter what I do.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.080]   And as you know, because you're a smart fella and you know statistics, there's no such thing
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.520]   as a hot streak.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.640]   You have exactly the same chance of losing next time that you did the first time and
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   the will and the subsequent times.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.280]   So are you maybe you're not, maybe you're not an addictive personality.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.800]   You think that's it, Georgia?
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.520]   That it's a some people are addictive personalities and they want that high and once they experience
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.680]   it, they have to get it back.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.440]   Is that that's amateur psychology?
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.000]   Well, well, no, I think that I think that you're accurate in a certain state.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.200]   I think that everyone has different things though that they could be addicted to.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.200]   That's true.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.440]   Like you have to just know what are the pits that are in front of you.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.640]   Oh, Dr. is addicted to barbecue, I think.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   I'm positive.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   I like it.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   It might be a good thing.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640]   It might be a good thing.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.640]   It might be a good thing.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.720]   Hey, I got one bag and I mean, a long news.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.160]   I said, why wrong get two is two for five.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:21.560]   I just want to say, don't ask me, but I was I really used my my my connection and I got
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.120]   Owen to send me his macaroni and cheese recipe.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120]   Don't worry, Owen.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.960]   No one will ever know.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.160]   First of all, the internet every time I get to check people want my cookbook to come out.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   I got to do it.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.240]   But I'll tell you what, you must know that I love you as an individual.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240]   I know.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:41.080]   Because when you said that to me, I thought, Oh my God, the the my excited when Oh, Dr.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.840]   just gave me emoji.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.320]   I think I made it Christmas day.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.320]   I made it.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.440]   I made I made two batches.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.040]   Was it it was so good?
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.880]   It was but it was also a heart attack in a jar.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.320]   As I wrote it out, I felt really bad sending it to you.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.640]   That's why I said, you know, you're not going to eat all this and it's going to be super.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640]   I felt really bad.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.120]   I'm like, if he dies from this, it's going to be my fault.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.120]   I got to eat.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   Oh my God.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.640]   So I split it into two batches.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:20.080]   One batch, I put Calabrian chilies in it to add a little color and spice.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.920]   And then I knew that some people would not want the spicy one.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.600]   So I just made this the traditional doctor.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   That is the and I am.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.160]   Oh, and I cooked it in the Traeger.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.640]   I smoked it for four or five hours.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.800]   That's that's kicking up.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.280]   That's what I do sometimes.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280]   But it is broken.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:38.480]   But it was good to just tell the people, like, because they can't taste it through the
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480]   screen.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   You know what I mean?
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.960]   When you ate it was a meal almost in itself.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.560]   Not only did I not take pictures, I will never make it again.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.880]   Look, I didn't get this big for nothing.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.480]   It just powerful, but it tastes so good.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   It is so good.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.640]   It tastes so good when I gave it to my daughter to take her things.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.280]   Everyone with her mother, she wouldn't even share with the rest of the family.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   She's like, you can't have this.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.280]   This is for me.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.080]   And then I'm like, I am eternally grateful.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.800]   Oh, we took you and Leah out to a restaurant and had their lobster mac and cheese.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.760]   I thought it might compete.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.720]   You were very polite about it.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.640]   You said it's fine.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.240]   Now that I've tasted yours.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.600]   Now you know, you get it.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.880]   You know the lobster didn't compete.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880]   Wow.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.120]   Yeah, lobster mac and cheese is not as good as regular O'Dr. Mac and cheese.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.520]   I put some lobster and crab in my gets crazy.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.760]   But we got we got to get back to talking about technology before we get started.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.280]   Oh, no, no, this is way too much fun.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.320]   I've actually because we have so few stories.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.280]   I've been I've been filling basically.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:47.040]   Just like your mac and cheese, I've been filling super filling.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.760]   I made a prime rib mac and cheese biscuits.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.440]   I think I I'm surprised people didn't die at the table.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   I really am.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440]   It was it was so good.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   It was so good.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.280]   Have you ever had the dungeness crab mac and cheese?
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.800]   That's oh my God, I'm now blanking on the place.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.840]   It's in Marshall like right on the edge of Timoel is there.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.600]   Oh, no, that sounds good.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.640]   Oh my gosh, I'm blanking on the name of the place in December and January in Northern
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.960]   California.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.600]   We get I think it's the best crab in the world's better than King crab from Alaska.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.960]   It's better than Baltimore's amazing Christoph shell crab.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.880]   It's called Duncan is dungeness crab and only he's got a few months a year.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.120]   Oh, let's start off by out.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.880]   You know what next Christmas?
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880]   We should go.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.960]   Is it it's a Marshall Mac and cheese?
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960]   Oh, it's Nick's Cove.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.960]   Oh, Nick's Cove.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.240]   Yeah, love Nick's Cove.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:44.080]   Yes, Nick's Cove has the best dungeness mac and cheese I've ever had in my life.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.160]   I've done I've taken a day off just to drive out there have the mac and cheese and drive
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   home.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   Tell me you don't want to go here.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.160]   Oh, doc.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   So good.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   The views are phenomenal.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.240]   They have like a oh, everything about it.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:05.320]   That's actually the bay that's tamales bay, which is the most amazing bay of the Pacific
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.880]   Ocean because it's pristine.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   They grow oysters there.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.560]   Hog island oysters amazing because it's the water you could see to the bottom.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.840]   It's incredibly pure and pristine.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:21.480]   And this despite the fact it's got like thriving seal colonies, I kayak out there and across
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.120]   the bay with tamales bay, there's a white oak reserve.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.480]   So if you're lucky, you'll be kayaking on the bay and you'll see the outcome down from
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.520]   the hills in Marin and you can hover off of hog island so named because people used to
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.560]   pasture their pigs there and let them root around in the importance of.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.200]   They call it hog island.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   Oh, no.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.200]   Yes.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200]   Oh, dear.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.400]   So if you get just the right point in the bay off hog island, you can hear the boom from
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.200]   the Pacific at the mouth of the bay as it's coming through.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.480]   There's a colony of seals that likes to hang out and sleep near her.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   I almost died.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.680]   It's just a beautiful afternoon.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.760]   Almost died in tamales bay.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.280]   I was kayaking out there.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.160]   My friend and I had strapped a grill to the tip of the kayak.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   It brought oysters.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   We kayaked out.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.160]   We kayaked out.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.600]   There's a little island out there.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.600]   We barbecue oysters.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.920]   We ate the oysters, strapped the grill back to the kayak, started coming back and the wind
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   changed and the waves got this big and we're going, are you all right back there?
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.000]   And we just barely made it back.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   And then we got back.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.960]   The kayak rental place said, yeah, we were watching.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.000]   Why did you rescue us?
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Here's a picture.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   You were watching for their kayak.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.280]   Yeah, they were worried about the car.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:38.400]   Here's a picture of the signature dish, the dungeness crab mac and cheese.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   All right.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.320]   I want some dungeness crabs.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   All right.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.400]   Next time you're out here, old doctor, you and Leah will listen.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.000]   I will take you.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.880]   If Georgia wants to come, if Lisa wants to come, we'll have a.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.440]   We'll do a twitted Nick's Cove.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.360]   That would be perfect.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.760]   Let's do it live there.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.960]   Coming out next month, my daughter started crying.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.200]   I was like, dude, you got school.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.840]   You're not bringing her?
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.320]   I got school.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.400]   You know why she wants to come out?
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.280]   Last time she was here, Lisa took her jewelry shopping.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.640]   They got to hang out.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.480]   Do not ever go jewelry shopping with Lisa.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.680]   Look, that sounds wonderful.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.560]   I'm sure Lisa has amazing taste.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.520]   She has amazing taste.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.600]   I think Leah got a little present.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.600]   She got presents.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.400]   She got socks, she got puddle-ooms socks.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.920]   It's funny to go there.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.920]   I just emailed Lisa.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.320]   Lisa gets brought up every other week because people are just like, oh, Leah, that's a nice
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.320]   ring.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.320]   That's a nice necklace.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.320]   She just more jumps into.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.680]   I wasn't so badly at Lisa.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.920]   We went.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.080]   Things are crazy.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:49.360]   Is Leah does not sound like that.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:54.680]   I was asked this week on Twitter about me getting to go out shopping with the black
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   card.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.680]   I don't want to brought up the black card.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.480]   I don't want to brought it up.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.440]   I didn't get to take a shot.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.440]   No, no.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   Leah did.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.800]   Hey, by the way, that was one of our events this week.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.160]   Georgia, have you done yours yet or yours coming up?
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160]   My what?
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.160]   Oh, I did it.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.160]   You did a clock tweet.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   I did a, yeah.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.160]   Fire side chat.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.160]   Fire one.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.160]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.160]   Exactly with Ant.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.640]   Oh, doctor's done one.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.680]   Ant puts these together for our club only.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:24.680]   Mike Elgin.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.200]   You should have had one with Owen and I together and then we would have just overtaken everything.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   It would have been a massive mountain.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.200]   Then there would have been no show.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200]   We would have just taught.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.520]   I'm just telling you, Ant, Thorat is coming up March 31st.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.000]   We're going to do one with Paul Thorat.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.800]   This is what we're trying to do is make Club Twit an exciting and ticing place to be.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.400]   The original idea was people said, "Well, we don't want to hear all the ads.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.960]   We don't want any ad tracking technology."
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.440]   So we said, "Well, you know what?
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.280]   If you give us seven bucks a month, which is about what we would make on you from ads,
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.440]   you don't have to have any ads."
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.920]   So that's how Club Twit was born.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.040]   It was Lisa's idea.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.520]   Ad-free versions of all the shows that are just yours.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.760]   That turns out the Discord, which is another benefit, we just thought, "Well, let's give
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.760]   them another benefit."
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.240]   It turns out to be really one of the great benefits.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.800]   It's so much fun to hang out in there.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.080]   All sorts of conversations, not just about our shows, but with our hosts.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.280]   Stacey has a book club.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.880]   We have the Untitled Linux Show.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.400]   Then we have all of these conversation pits on everything.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.640]   Crypto, food, gaming, hacking.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.120]   We have a Let's Play group where we have a dedicated, actually now two dedicated Minecraft
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.000]   servers just for the club.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.880]   And then there's the Twit Plus feed where you could hear George's Fireside Chat.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.040]   Oh, doctors ask me anything.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.760]   The upcoming Paul Therat, Stacey's book club, The Untitled Linux Show that gives all the
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   shows that are.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.440]   By the way, we've been, well, I'll tell you in a second what we've been doing in there.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.520]   But if you want to join, Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.920]   There's a little plug for it.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.680]   Now that, by the way, was an ad that the people who are Club Twit members did not hear.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.880]   So if you're hearing it, go to Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.920]   And you'll never have to hear this ad again.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.680]   We are also going to start using this to launch new shows.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.080]   And the very first show we've launched in there that we're about to make public this
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.920]   week in space is starting on Friday with Rod Pyle and Tarek Malek.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.880]   Tarek comes from space.com.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.960]   Rod is from the National Space Society.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.040]   He's a contributor to the Tech Guy Road Radio Show.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.880]   That is ready to launch and go public.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.040]   So go to Twit.tv/twists.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.160]   You could sign up, get on the feed, get links or whatever.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.920]   And the first episode, there's an episode zero, but episode one is this Friday.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.280]   It has been Club members only.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.520]   We're now going public with that.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.520]   All right.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520]   Let's take a little break.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.800]   More with a great panel.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.640]   Lisa Schmeiser is here.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640]   Brand new job.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.760]   No jitter at nojitter.com.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.680]   What is no jitter?
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:02.440]   It's a site that focuses on communication from telecom and telephony all the way up through
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:09.880]   collaboration platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack, WebEx.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.520]   Basically, if you want to talk to somebody over the internet, it starts with the end
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.160]   user and goes all the way down to the network infrastructure.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.800]   Wow.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.000]   That sounds like a thing I'm going to have to subscribe to.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.840]   And it's open to the public's free or is it a paid?
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   It's open to the public.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.840]   Nice.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840]   Nojitter.com.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   A great name.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.560]   And part of my scope now, I'm also co-chairing a conference called Enterprise Connect.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:42.720]   It's next month from March 19th to the 24th, EnterpriseConnect.com or Dennen Orlando.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:49.080]   We'll be talking about emerging issues like meeting equity, which is becoming a bigger
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.840]   deal is more and more workplaces.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840]   Go hybrid.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.960]   We'll be talking about the emergence of AR in VR in the workplace and how that's going
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.880]   to shape how you do your job.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.520]   You look at some of the security challenges that come up with Zoom and Slack.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.520]   All the stuff that people are going to have to just kind of casually incorporate into
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.280]   their workspace in the next few years.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:15.440]   You can find out about that as well at nojitter.com, EnterpriseConnect coming up in March.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.960]   Well, congratulations on the new gig.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.960]   That's great.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   Thank you.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   Well done.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.960]   Thank you.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:25.040]   Also, Georgia Dow, I'll ask you about your YouTube channel soon.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.040]   No doctor, I'm not going to ask you anything.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.680]   You want to ask me?
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.040]   I don't want to know.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040]   It's not that I...
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.680]   Oh, he's got a Funko Papa, Georgia.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.560]   When we get to Funko Papa, oh, doctor.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.280]   One of the AMA questions was, is there still a podcast?
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:48.240]   Well, you and Georgia in the works, I said, I got to work on her now.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240]   I let her stop.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.240]   Now I got to get her.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.240]   I have to grab a Funko Papa.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.440]   I'm going to start a guilt trip.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   I'm a work owner, guys.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.240]   Would you do a Funko Papa podcast?
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.240]   A podcast?
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.680]   Or a Funko pod, as we call them?
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.680]   I mean, I could.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.800]   I got Jefferson over here on deck.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.680]   I mean, I got a whole bunch of...
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.440]   Where did those come from?
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.480]   They're just big head bobbleheads, right?
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.480]   Is that really?
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.040]   They don't bobble, but they big.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.040]   I mean, they heads as big.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.040]   Oh, they don't bobble?
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.040]   No, they don't bobble.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.040]   They don't even like rote.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.560]   It seems like they're missing a bet there.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.560]   They really could have made those bobbleheads.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.040]   I mean, they're friends.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.400]   Anyway, we got to pay bills.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400]   Talk to me.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400]   Okay.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.160]   Now they have squid game Funko Pops.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.000]   You can't be trusted.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.120]   I'll show you today.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.880]   Actually, this is for all the cooks in the audience.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.480]   This is the place to get your produce, your vegetables, imperfect foods.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.520]   Now, don't be fooled by the name.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.680]   I think they're perfect.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:53.200]   The idea is imperfect foods was founded because they found out that a huge amount of food
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.000]   in our, in the US food system was wasted.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.760]   Just fell through the cracks.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.920]   Produced groceries said, well, that's, I can't carry that apple.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:07.920]   It's too small or, or meats or vegetables, or even snacks that there's too much of it
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.240]   or nobody's, whatever.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.520]   They can, you can now get it.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.640]   It's basically a grocery delivery service, but it offers a line of sustainable groceries
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.320]   that taste delicious, reduce waste, and embrace the natural imperfections in food.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.640]   The chickens, the heritage chickens I get from imperfect foods are amazing.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.440]   I will eat no other now.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:35.600]   They're pasture raised, heritage chickens, incredible snacks, and the produce.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.080]   It's always fresh seasonal produce.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.080]   Okay.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.680]   I admit, they're not apples the size of your head.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.360]   They're apples like they used to be when I was a kid and you'd go to the apple orchard
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.520]   and you'd pick the apples.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.960]   They're a little smaller, but they're sweeter.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.760]   I think they're just the way apples should be.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.680]   The original kind of apples, it's such a great idea.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.200]   Now, I should have said right up front, it doesn't.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.720]   They don't deliver everywhere.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.840]   So you need to go to imperfectfoods.com and see if they deliver in your area.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.720]   One of the things they do, which is great, they deliver on the same day each week so that
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.800]   they can combine the truck runs.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.480]   That in, by the way, saves emissions.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:21.200]   In fact, this delivery weekly by neighborhood model produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions than
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.120]   individual trips to the grocery stores.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.600]   So you're saving that way too.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.880]   And the other thing, a lot of, you know, I was worried about packaging.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.560]   They take all the packaging back.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.880]   They use a minimal amount of packaging.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.640]   It's basically cardboard box.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.120]   They don't put a lot of plastic bags in there or anything.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.720]   And they take it all back and reuse it.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.240]   So you'd never feel bad about packaging, no more packaging guilt.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.320]   In fact, I think it's the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.040]   the packaging after every order.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.120]   I just, I am such a fan.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.120]   Our day is Thursday and we love imperfect foods.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.480]   Save the environment, get great food that would otherwise go to waste.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.880]   You're doing a good thing for yourself and for the planet.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.760]   Right now you're also going to save 20% off your first four orders.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.000]   Just go to imperfectfoods.com.

[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.760]   We had imperfect foods broccoli just last night.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.040]   So good.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.560]   So green.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.000]   So fresh.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.920]   Join the movement imperfectfoods.com promo code TWIT.

[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.840]   the planet too.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.840]   I love it.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.280]   Perfectfoods.com and don't forget that offer code because that's how they know you.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.120]   So I hear and that helps.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:56.240]   imperfectfoods.com promo code TWIT.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.280]   I got my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.920]   I like it a lot.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:08.720]   I don't think the newest ones have this problem but apparently Samsung shipped 100 million
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.680]   phones with broken encryption.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.000]   That's a lot of phones.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.400]   That's a lot of phones.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.880]   A lot of phones.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.600]   This was something discovered by Tel Aviv University in Israel.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.640]   The researchers wrote a paper called Trust.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.160]   I love this.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.640]   By the way, it's very competitive now in the security research field.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.200]   You've just got to have a catchy thing.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.880]   Trust dies in darkness.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.360]   Shedding light on Samsung's Trust Zone keymaster design.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:41.560]   They'll be presented at usenix this year.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:47.200]   They rely on something called trusted execution environment which comes from arms trust zone
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.760]   technology.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.600]   Basically, it's an isolated operating system, the trust zone operating system.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:00.240]   But it's up to vendors to implement the crypto within the trust zone operating system.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:10.440]   Apparently Samsung made a little mistake in the hardware abstraction layer.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.560]   This is actually not at all uncommon.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.480]   They used an imperfect random number generator.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.160]   Samsung failed to implement keymaster TA.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.560]   TA is the trust abstraction, the trust architecture.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:36.640]   It's properly in its Galaxy S9, S10, S8, S20, and even the S21 last years.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.920]   The researchers show how they could obtain keys from the hardware protected blob.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.800]   Again, this happens in Steve talks about this all the time.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.680]   Random number generators are not random.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.360]   They're pseudo-random.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:24:02.920]   Matthew Green, who is our favorite crypto guy at Johns Hopkins, said that the unique number
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.960]   which ensures that the AES encryption produces a different result every time.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:12.200]   The salt, they call it, needs to be unique.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:17.120]   But if you reuse it, it's not unique.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.360]   Green tweeted, "So they could have derived a different key wrapping key for each key they
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   protect.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.840]   But instead, Samsung basically doesn't.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:30.280]   They allow the app layer code to pick encryption IVs, which allows trivial decryption IV as
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:35.840]   the initialization vector that initializes the random number.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.000]   This is called an IV reuse attack."
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.480]   Just mentioning it.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:50.600]   Not a problem with the latest Samsung devices.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.720]   Samsung did not immediately respond to request to confirm the researchers' estimate of effective
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:00.520]   devices and to estimate if how many devices, if any, remain unpatched.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.520]   Basically they had nothing to say.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.520]   Nothing to see here.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.520]   Nothing to see here.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   Pay no attention.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.720]   Honestly, I mentioned it just to point out it's very hard to do this right.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.840]   It's easy to make a mistake in crypto.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.880]   That's why you want to get it reviewed by crypto experts.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.160]   It's good that there's a security community that bangs on this stuff.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.920]   I presume Samsung will fix this.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.720]   It's the thing you can fix the software.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.920]   But these things happen.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.880]   It's just going to be aware of it.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.240]   I don't think this attack is so easy to do that it's going to be a threat.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:36.600]   We don't know of any in the wild exploits.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.080]   Just raising awareness is all I'm doing.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.960]   I'm excited about the web, the James Webb Telescope.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.560]   I bet you Georgia Dow is a James Webb nerd.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560]   I don't know why.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.240]   I just feel like you might be.
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.240]   We have a little telescope so we do quite enjoy it.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.240]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.960]   Yes, I'm excited about the Webb Telescope.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.760]   I'm just so happy that it's working.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   That's the amazing thing.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   One of those fun things.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   10 billion dollars.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.400]   They've been working on this 20 years.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.040]   It's finally at the Lagrange point, which is a million kilometers out so far that it's
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.840]   going to be very hard if there's a problem to fix it.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:22.040]   It had to be folded up like an origami project to fit in the nose cone so they could launch
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040]   it.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:29.120]   Then it had to perfectly go through hundreds of steps to unfold it.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.400]   Without a flaw it did.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.680]   The mirror is 18 separate mirrors.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.720]   They're hexagonal and an array.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.040]   Much of which can be controlled separately.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.800]   It's out there a million kilometers from Earth.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.320]   Now the mirrors have to be adjusted.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:50.280]   They move very, very, very slowly so that the images they're collecting can be converged
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.720]   on a single point basically to focus it.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720]   You probably saw it.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.360]   We talked about it a few weeks ago.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:01.160]   The first images came back 18 separate images.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:07.320]   Now they've been able to get it all to converge.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.720]   They've successfully completed the image alignment.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.680]   They are moments away.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.000]   I think it is very soon that we're going to see the first perfect images from this most
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.880]   amazing telescope.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.800]   All the images are in the same place.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:33.240]   The goal now is to get those tiny little nanometer adjustments.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.800]   In order to get the final focus, engineers have to image the spectra of light looking
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:44.400]   for slight shifts of the image locations at different wavelengths and then fine tune it.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.720]   Pretty amazing.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.200]   Pretty amazing.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:49.920]   Good news.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.760]   John wasn't it February 25th.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.600]   Wasn't that the day they said we'd get our first images?
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.920]   I guess maybe they're a little bit behind.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920]   Maybe it's next month.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.000]   Maybe it's March 25th.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   It's pretty soon.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   It's pretty soon.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   It's been an amazing story.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.520]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:12.840]   Yeah, right because they have a sun shield but it gets pretty hot out there.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.760]   We've starting to see some reviews of the Steam deck.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.800]   We were talking about games.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800]   Steam.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.200]   I got, boy, this is a year ago, right?
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.200]   I got in the pre-order.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.000]   I haven't gotten an invite.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.240]   No, we haven't gotten our invite either.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.040]   Well, you and I may be glad.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.840]   Leo's asking about it.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840]   I'm like, "I don't know, bro.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.160]   It might not work out for you."
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:43.080]   From Sean Hollister on the Verge, Steam Deck review, it's not ready.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.000]   He says, "Both of these things are true.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.640]   First, I'm having more fun with the Steam Deck than any gadget I've tested in years.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.920]   Second, it's a mess.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.000]   It's rushed.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   It's unfinished.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.480]   It's buggy and unstable.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:00.600]   If people sold it at Best Buy or GameStop, they'd be returning it in droves.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.320]   But of course, the people who are getting it are all people like you and me, Georgia,
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.400]   who can't wait.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.520]   We're in on the beta, $400.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.720]   Here's the good news, at least from my point of view.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.680]   All of these games on this are, it's a Linux box.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.200]   It's running Linux.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.760]   So all of these games had to be rewritten to work with Linux.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.800]   So it's been a great boon for Linux gaming.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.800]   It's really good news for Linux gaming.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.920]   I don't see Elden Ring on it.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920]   Not the great--
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.720]   Probably won't, no.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:38.000]   The fan apparently quite noisy, never stops whining, says Sean.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.080]   There are still many games that don't work.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.680]   And battery life, two hours at the highest fidelity.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.760]   A little disappointing.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.400]   Nevertheless, I still feel like there's a lot of promise here.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.880]   I'm excited about it.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:56.320]   You'd buy it, right, Georgia, even with all the negative--
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.240]   All the stuff, yeah.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240]   I'll try it out.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   I'll see how it goes.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.240]   Again, like--
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.560]   Actually, for $400, it's pretty amazing.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560]   It's pretty--
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.320]   Again, I hope that they fix all the bugs, and so it works really nicely.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:16.480]   I'm not very tolerant of buggy hardware software.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:20.000]   Well, and that's one of the benefits of console gaming,
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.320]   right, is that you just turn it on generally,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.840]   unless it's Cyberpunk 2077.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:29.040]   Just works.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.520]   Especially with most games, my daughter is a PC game,
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.920]   like she's in the steam.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.120]   She was like, oh, I want this thing.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.880]   I'm like, ah, let's wait and see.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.200]   So I figure some out.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.240]   But she's like, just the concept of being
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.280]   able to take the games to friends that don't have gaming
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.280]   PCs.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.000]   She's like, I could get so many more people to play
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.600]   if I could just take a tone, because I can't take my computer
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.400]   over people's house.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.760]   I'm like, well, I should have got your laptop
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.000]   that if that's what you're thinking,
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.800]   you just want to go out and mobile play with people.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.400]   I think this is going to be better than a laptop,
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.560]   at least when it's finished.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.960]   No doubt is better than a laptop.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.400]   I'm just saying, I didn't even think of wanting
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.360]   to just go and play games with kids like that.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.760]   I mean, the Switch was that kind of thing
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.880]   where kids came together and part of the game played.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.040]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.040]   It's been fascinating.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.880]   It's been fascinating watching the Switch
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.200]   take off like a virus among my daughter's elementary school
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.720]   cohort.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.400]   What do they play?
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.240]   Animal Crossing?
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   What do they play?
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.320]   Or Zelda or Minecraft?
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.520]   Minecraft.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.920]   They do a lot of Minecraft.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.160]   Interesting.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:28.360]   They love, love, love, love, love, making shared worlds
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.520]   and exploring them together and doing--
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.600]   they're aging out of the kind of really immersive
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.840]   imaginative play that little kids do.
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.840]   But it's been interesting watching
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.080]   how the girls-- because I have a daughter--
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.240]   watching the girls bond over creating worlds
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.240]   and setting up rules for them and then having interactions
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.280]   and things like that.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.920]   But in the course of like, I would say two years,
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:55.000]   we went from no one in any of my kids' classes having
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.880]   a Switch to practically everybody.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.840]   And now there are play dates that are set up
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.560]   where everybody brings over their Switch.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.720]   Or they connect with each other in social spaces and do that.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.840]   And the portability, I think, is what makes it easy.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.520]   Because you're not tethered to a whole setup.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.040]   You can just pick up your little case and go and hang out
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.080]   with your friends and pop on.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.720]   And it's just so easy to set up.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.880]   I was really pleasantly surprised by it.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.120]   It's really a surprising form factor, actually.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:25.840]   I have a Switch.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.200]   I love it.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.240]   I play Animal Crossing.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.200]   And I thought this was going to be kind of a Switch
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.440]   for grownups more.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:36.040]   Because it's a Windows or Linux machine, quad cores in,
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.600]   two processor and 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.120]   I mean, it's a pretty serious device.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.120]   It's a seven inch screen.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:43.040]   It's not huge.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.400]   But I mean, it's bigger than you think.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.760]   That's the size of the Switch.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.600]   It looks like they wanted to make a Switch for AAA titles,
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.640]   kind of.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.760]   Although the gaming on the Switch is pretty good,
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.360]   I have to say.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.880]   I was interested in these D-Pads.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.680]   I want to know how the functionality works
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.680]   like what they're setting up.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:08.160]   Because everything about this seems great.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.360]   They need to fix it.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.120]   Fix it.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.000]   Well, I'm only looking at this as the R's technical review.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:14.680]   They agree.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.120]   Software's very buggy.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.160]   Sam Moskovich, who's very good on this stuff.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.440]   But he does say the hardware is good.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.440]   And look, if it's just software, that's fixable.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.600]   That's totally fixable.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.280]   Two hours of battery life for something mobile
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.320]   with a bright screen, playing intensive games.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.080]   I live in a world where you got a little power bank,
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:31.920]   you'll charge it up.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.640]   It's not bad.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.280]   It's not bad.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.160]   I wouldn't expect, honestly, more than that.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.120]   Although the Switch, what is your daughter's experience
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.280]   with the Switch?
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.000]   I don't play it long enough.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.840]   The Switch, because I've taken it sometimes to play it,
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.000]   you might get three hours out of it playing.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.280]   It's not much better.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:53.720]   But if I'm playing 2K or Mortal Kombat or something,
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.160]   something intensive, you're getting a little bit over two hours.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:03.600]   It's not five, six hours of play time running on that thing.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.360]   Gaming is really interesting, because honestly, it's
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.080]   what drives a lot of technology.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.800]   There isn't a whole lot--
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.320]   Can't a team have always drives technology?
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.520]   Well, that is true, isn't it?
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.160]   But there's not a lot of software that challenges modern PCs,
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.240]   except games.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.920]   There's some pro stuff, video editing and photo editing
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.200]   and stuff and rocket launching.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.400]   But for most users, the games are the hardest challenge.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.680]   They need the most hardware for games.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.760]   And we love games.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.120]   Games are bigger than ever.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.760]   It's bigger than Hollywood.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:45.400]   I think with VR coming and AR gaming and AR socializing coming
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.480]   with the world going into hell in the hand basket,
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.240]   we're going to want to play more games.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.440]   It's a nice escape.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.000]   It's a nice escape.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.840]   I have to say, it's a really fun, very cool experience,
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.680]   where you can experience things that you would never
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.520]   be able to do in real life.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.040]   So--
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.200]   And I think a lot of the stigma, you
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.480]   don't hear as much Congress saying, oh, or moms saying,
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.920]   oh, it's going to ruin your eyes or whatever it is, mom.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:15.160]   You say, get outside, get some fresh air.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.080]   What are you going to play games for a living?
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.200]   You don't hear that as much anymore.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:19.720]   Yes, you can.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:20.360]   Yeah, you can.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.120]   Some people are playing games for a living.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:22.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.240]   Lisa.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.640]   Well, I would also argue that you should look at gaming,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.480]   because that's going to be your next generation of user
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.160]   interfaces and software.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:31.660]   Right.
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:35.160]   And Leo, I'm sure I've said this on your show before.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.920]   But I feel like we're in the dying age of desktop computing,
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.640]   where the desktop is the primary metaphor for working.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.200]   And you have now a cohort of people
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.120]   who are heading into the workplace who
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:49.520]   grew up on Minecraft in other really customizable environments.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.200]   And I'm sure if you're in your 20s,
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:55.200]   you're like, well, what is this desktop and file system?
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.800]   Why?
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.720]   Why can't I create a space that works with the way my brain
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.560]   works, and let's be organized information the way
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.000]   that's useful to me.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.440]   And play the games now or just don't understand how things
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.880]   are going to look in 10 years, man.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.680]   I agree.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:20.080]   I also wonder, gaming used to be the toy store kind of the--
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.200]   but because it's now bigger than the movie industry,
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.280]   I think it's becoming a primary entertainment form.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.200]   I also think because of e-sports,
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.240]   it's only a matter of time before it's also
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.720]   going to be a spectator sport.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.880]   Yeah, the gaming is going to be--
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.920]   Isn't it kind of like a bigger shift towards more hands-on
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:43.760]   and active participation in entertainment?
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.720]   You think about even the way people watch TV these days,
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.280]   it's a multi-screen experience because they're
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.240]   tweeting their reactions, or they're
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.560]   on online fan communities, looking at references
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.480]   and parsing things out.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.080]   And gaming is just--
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.080]   you're not just passively watching a narrative.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.880]   You're changing the narrative.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.760]   You're participating in it directly.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.080]   And that seems to be something that really resonates
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.080]   with a lot of people.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.640]   And even if you're watching as a spectator,
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.920]   you end up playing it.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.520]   I mean, I watched a bunch of "Elden Ring" videos
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.360]   because I thought this is too hard.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.440]   And that made me want to play it more.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.080]   It kind of goes hand in hand.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.920]   Twitch is huge, isn't it?
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:24.880]   And YouTube gaming--
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.560]   let's play gaming-- huge right now.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.960]   And people are-- the creators are making many of the millions
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:31.440]   of dollars.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.800]   And I think it's a future of entertainment.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:37.200]   And I think it's interesting that you're
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   seeing new form factors.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.040]   That's the other thing.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.600]   This Steam Deck is a new form factor in the way
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.360]   you really don't see new PC form factors
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.960]   or new console form factors.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.440]   So it's kind of interesting.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.120]   I guess Nintendo gets credit, though, for starting this.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.440]   And I'm still going to shake my fist at the cloud
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.560]   like a grumpy old man.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.760]   I mean, everything you guys said sounded great.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.600]   Guess what?
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.160]   Nothing's hanging with this PC when it comes to me gaming.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.640]   And my Nintendo Switch is great for my fluff and portability.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.800]   But those cartoon characters-- I can't get better graphics
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.880]   by now-- it's been five years, Nintendo.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.320]   Not everything has to be Zelda-like and fluffy.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.280]   I want some grit.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.440]   I want some hardcore stuff in these games in this system.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.640]   Everything in 8-bit emoji is driving me crazy.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.880]   Technology isn't moving forward.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.800]   So you talk about the future?
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.440]   The future ain't here yet, homie, OK?
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.720]   I'm not here running with the Thunder Computer
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.400]   and the new Mac-- and one Mac with bros.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.560]   Hey, look, the power ain't there yet.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.360]   The future is still far away.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.520]   You're just an old school.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.640]   Oh, doctor, you're just an old man.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.560]   Hey, look, I've been hearing about "Lawmore Man"
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.080]   since the '70s, bro.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.480]   I've been hearing about--
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.120]   Wait a minute, you're sitting next to the queen of VR.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.520]   Oh, the metaverse is coming with the--
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.200]   I played second life, OK?
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:57.240]   I was making hotels and bars and clothes for people,
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:01.880]   making $1,000 off of people in 2005, 2007, OK?
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.320]   Oh, that's about all of a sudden, we're
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.560]   about to jump into the future.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.720]   Do you have-- oh, and do you have any VR at home?
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.280]   Do you have any--
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:07.640]   No, I don't.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.640]   I don't have time to get nauseous yet, OK?
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.240]   It ain't work.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.840]   Matter of fact, something breaks.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.840]   Everybody I hear about the empty day was in the next 24--
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.280]   Some of the greatest trash you ever imagined.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:18.600]   See them?
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.960]   So it's making some dope stuff.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:20.520]   Guess what?
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.160]   Three months later, something better is coming out.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.640]   Don't you buy one thing VR until Apple
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.480]   come out with their crap new glasses,
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.480]   and then wait for the second iteration to spend the money.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.320]   Because you don't have FOMO.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.800]   Oh, you don't want to get them this year.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:33.360]   They're saying $3,500 to the first generation.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.680]   Just told you, the FOMO will have you spending it with--
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.760]   The FOMO.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.600]   All you got to do is think about a lawn mower, man, OK?
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.920]   They've been preaching and selling.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.440]   We got to go four or five years,
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:45.440]   I'll put these goggles on as I are yakking all over my desk.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.680]   Form mark, FOMO will go and get you.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.600]   What do you--
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.080]   Are you your HTC Vive, right?
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:52.640]   Georgia?
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.200]   Yeah, we have it all, but we have HTC Vive.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.040]   Is that your preferred?
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.000]   I like the Vive better, yes.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.920]   I feel like the Oculus, though, is taking the world by storm.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.640]   It was the number one app on Christmas Day,
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.800]   which means they're all like, oh, it's the only thing left.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.080]   It's the only thing left to buy for children.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.480]   My kids got everything.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.800]   Yeah, the Vive requires a heavy duty PC.
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.880]   The Oculus, the Quest 2, just stand alone.
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.600]   What can I buy?
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.200]   I don't really play.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.520]   But nobody plays it.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.000]   I got so many friends they bought for their kids for Christmas.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.520]   I asked them a week ago, I like it.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.720]   They haven't picked it up.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.760]   First week, they were all drunk and running in the TV.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.600]   It's not a--
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.120]   It's not a--
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.120]   And sure, companies have gone up.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.600]   Claims have gone up 30%.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:34.880]   OK?
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.920]   Because people here punch in TVs, jumping out of windows,
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.760]   and falling over and--
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.080]   OK?
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.400]   So just pump the brakes on all the VR stuff.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.200]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.480]   Do you agree, Georgia?
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.280]   You don't agree.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:45.760]   You think you should--
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.720]   I don't agree.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.560]   I don't agree.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:48.840]   I do love it.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:49.600]   I don't think it's ready.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.920]   I think you're right.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.240]   I think you're right, Owen.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.760]   It's not ready yet, really, for consumable.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.640]   I think Oculus is.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.960]   But then it's Facebook and your title is Facebook.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.440]   You know what I would pay to watch, Georgia?
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.880]   Why don't you have a YouTube channel of you and your costume
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:07.400]   with a headset playing the game?
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.480]   I would just watch that.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.960]   I do--
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.960]   Like, I did.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:16.200]   So I did send you a sacrifice in VR,
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.360]   which was really actually a really cool--
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.480]   If you sent me a sacrifice, I did not get it.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.840]   Did you send it to my email address?
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.840]   It's on YouTube.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.000]   I didn't send it to you.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.360]   But I did it in VR.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.600]   Is there a game called Send You a Sacrifice?
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.520]   Is that what you're telling me?
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.120]   Yes, it's Hellblade.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.720]   Oh, I thought you actually sent me a sacrifice house.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.200]   Didn't you get a sacrifice?
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.560]   There was no one in sacrifice for the making of it.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.360]   When did you send me that sacrifice?
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.240]   Because I don't remember getting it.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.680]   So this is a game called Thank You for Clarifying.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.000]   Yes.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.080]   Send You a Sacrifice.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.000]   And she goes through psychosis.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.680]   Oh, geez.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.200]   And she hears things and she sees things.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.520]   Wow.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.480]   And I don't want to live through that.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.200]   That doesn't sound--
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.240]   In hearing it in VR and going through her journey in VR
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.720]   and hearing it all over around you
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.920]   was such an empathic experience for me as a therapist,
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.640]   but just for me to understand someone else's journey,
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.240]   it was really kind of eerie and cool.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.080]   I think that for some people it might be too intense,
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.120]   because you really do feel like you are there.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.320]   And I've had people describe how they would actually talk--
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.520]   Eventually, they're talking to the voices back.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.960]   And it feels like it's a part of them.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.080]   And I think that it helps some people
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.000]   go understand what someone that's
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.720]   dealing with psychosis is going through.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:43.600]   And also, to understand how you believe your world that you're
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.280]   in, because we only view the world
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.440]   through our own experience of that.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.640]   And so what might seem like off to other people
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.160]   is just real and understandable to others.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.560]   And so I think that that was a really--
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560]   it was a really neat experience.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:59.800]   So she-- so I have a close family member
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.520]   who's been through several psychotic breaks, hospitalized
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.080]   all of that.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:07.320]   And they've been trying to explain to me what it's like.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.320]   And you can't understand.
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.320]   You can't.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.800]   I've been on the outside watching, and it's horrific.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.600]   But you can't understand what was going on.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.960]   And this person says it was very traumatic.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.880]   They still live the trauma at PTSD from it.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:26.200]   So you think this would be a good game to play just to kind of--
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.840]   How close is it?
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.920]   You've not been through psychosis, so you probably--
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.000]   I haven't.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.480]   And no one who's been through this would want to play this game,
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.360]   because it would probably be very reactivating.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.920]   Some people have and actually found
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.240]   that it was really a wonderful experience.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:49.000]   And they loved the way that they showed it.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.680]   And the makers of Hellblade, they really--
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.000]   like Ninja Theory hired a psychiatrist--
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:57.960]   Oh, interesting.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.480]   --who dealt with psychosis.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:02.200]   They actually hired people that are going through psychosis.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.440]   This looks really beautiful.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.800]   This looks through psychosis.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.440]   To make sure that it was real and honest.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.760]   And they had to do that balance of how far do they go,
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.600]   so that they're not doing a disservice.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.240]   But it's still an honest portrayal of what
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:21.000]   is it like to have to go through that.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]   It's not a shooter.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.360]   You're not--
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.200]   It's a first-- well, third person,
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.840]   like you're kind of behind her.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.000]   She looks like she's--
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.080]   You feel like you're there.
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.120]   A little crazy.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.120]   Sounds like a cool game like I've played.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.360]   Well, she's a Celtic picked.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.280]   OK.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.200]   So you're going through what she would go through.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.760]   But that's also very accurate.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.360]   They tried to make it as accurate as possible.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.440]   I'm going to have to play this game.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:49.440]   Wow, this really sense.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.440]   It's a very cool game.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.160]   One is it's a puzzle game.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.480]   So you're in her world and she sees symbols, which
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.480]   is also something that some people with psychosis
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.240]   can go through.
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.040]   And you have to actually figure out
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:01.520]   whatever you're looking for the letter that
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.720]   looks like a letter M. And you have to kind of move
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.520]   the world so that you find an M. And so the tree plus this wall
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.120]   makes together a letter M. So there's part puzzle.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.600]   And then there's a part fighting game.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.240]   And you go through her story.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.480]   And through it, these voices are mostly kind of saying
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.960]   mean things to you and putting doubt in your mind.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.480]   And she's having to fight her internal battle
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.400]   that she's then expressing outwardly.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.560]   Oh, it's very interesting.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.040]   And I don't think that you can see that in a game.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.080]   That's not a traditional game.
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:31.120]   That's a really interesting idea.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.840]   I played a game like this like a long time ago.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:33.720]   It was called Max Payne.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:35.640]   They made a movie, a horrible movie out of it.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.600]   But it was like this.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.720]   And it is a creepy thing because he was going through mental issues
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.440]   and even in the spirits, whatever his mind was talking to him,
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.560]   playing tricks on him.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.160]   And you'd hear it.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.240]   If he had surround sound, it would really freak you out.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.400]   Because someone being left here telling you to do stuff.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.400]   And you're like, wait, what?
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.040]   And as you're playing the game at night,
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.760]   it would make me jump sometimes.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.720]   I'm like, whoa, what is like?
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:55.760]   Who is here?
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.000]   And it's having something in the back.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.080]   I love that game.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.960]   And yeah, this seems great.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.360]   I mean, I want to make me want to put on some goggles.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.840]   Play station, or is this VR only?
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.320]   No, this is actually a console game
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.640]   that then they ported down to VR.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.680]   So I played it--
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.760]   Better with VR?
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.160]   Or better with VR?
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:18.600]   I have to say, the only thing is that if you get motion sickness,
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.560]   I don't usually get motion sickness in VR.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.000]   I did feel it a little bit because I'm using the controller.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.480]   So I'm not walking around the same way I'm looking around.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.920]   But it was really cool.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:32.440]   If not, you would wear it with a headset at the same time
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.080]   so that you can hear it in 3D.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.440]   Really, really neat experience.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.440]   And I think that experiential things like that,
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:43.960]   you can experience in a way that seems more real than you
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.240]   could.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.800]   If you want to really experience what it's
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.520]   like to go into an Egyptian tomb, doing that in VR,
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.360]   you get the scale, you can feel things, you can see them.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.520]   And so it's a really neat experience.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.600]   And I think that for this game, it was really cool.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.440]   I'm happy that I did it in VR instead
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:05.040]   of just playing it on the computer.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.880]   S-E-N-U-A. Not send you a sacrifice.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.200]   Not send you a sacrifice.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.320]   The new a sacrifice.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.080]   And I think Ninja Theory did an amazing job
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:21.480]   of really caring about being able to show what people are
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.000]   dealing with with psychosis and not falling
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.560]   into those old tropes of there's something wrong with her.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:27.840]   And she's crazy.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.320]   And she's scary.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.240]   And that means that she's dangerous.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.240]   And I have to say I applaud them for being able to do that
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:35.800]   in a really respectful way.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.320]   And also raises some really interesting ideas
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.560]   about how a game can be an experience
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.160]   and can introduce you to the experiences of others
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.520]   by walking a mile in their shoes to use the cliche.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.880]   Very interesting.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.400]   Oh, I have to try this.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.120]   But definitely play it with a headset on if you're going
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:05.360]   to do it because it's really eerie but a neat experience
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:06.000]   for most people.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.160]   And for some people, it might be a little bit too intense.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.920]   Well, that's the ahead's moments in the game also.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.520]   So you're saying do do it in VR?
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.040]   Yes.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.560]   I would definitely try it in VR.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.960]   But grab some fresh ginger afterwards
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.680]   because you might feel like motion thick.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.440]   You have to do it in like 45 minutes since.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.800]   I will get nauseated if I spend too much time.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.560]   And depending on the type of game especially.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.720]   Yeah, yeah, the movement.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.200]   I mean, I got nauseated playing Halo
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.120]   because there was a lot of head bob or something.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.760]   There was just something about it.
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.640]   Yeah, well, you're moving, especially when you're going
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.880]   across the axis.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.720]   And if when you zone-- so I don't get it if I'm using teleport.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.760]   But if I'm walking, I get much more motion sickness
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:52.240]   because what happens is that your brain is getting
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:53.800]   two different signals, right?
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.440]   So because the slow, the tracking movement,
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.880]   you're kind of getting a different signal
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.120]   than actually walking.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.600]   And so because of that, your brain and the horizon
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.040]   are different.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.320]   And your brain thinks that you're sick.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.960]   Like you've eaten some poison or there's something wrong.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.920]   And so once you throw up the poison--
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:09.440]   Right.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.880]   --it's like an adaptive mechanism.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:13.520]   But it is not really helpful if you're on a boat
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:16.280]   or if you're playing VR.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.160]   Our brains are not adapted to VR.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:21.160]   And so because of that, you might feel some motion sickness.
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.800]   You know, I have to stand up and play.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.240]   If I sit down and play, I get nauseous.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.000]   Like if I'm standing up--
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]   Yes, exactly.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000]   Exactly.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.600]   I feel like I can-- I play just fine.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.520]   But if you sit down and try to come from me,
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:32.760]   it just throws me all off.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:33.760]   And I'm like, what am I doing in here?
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.160]   Exactly.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.880]   It's such a weird-- like I said, we're not at peak plugging
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.880]   my brain technology.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.000]   But we'll get there one day.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.200]   You know, I might try this on--
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.240]   this is the compromise.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.120]   I have a big screen, 55-inch OLED gaming screen.
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.640]   If I sit close enough to it, it's almost immersive.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   I might try it that way.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.080]   Well, as long as you have a headset on,
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.480]   I think that you'll still feel--
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480]   You mean headphones?
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.480]   --white headphones.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:00.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.160]   I think that it's quite immersive.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:04.640]   It's not as much in the world.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.280]   Because there's a scene where she comes up
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.760]   and she's looking at you.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.280]   And it's kind of like this out-of-world feeling in VR.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.640]   And she goes to touch your cheek.
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:20.400]   And it was really this strong emotional moment.
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:21.400]   And the voices.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.120]   And then she kind of touches you.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.160]   And it did kind of bring me back.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:29.080]   That was a really interesting experience for it.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.160]   And that you wouldn't get.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.960]   But you would get it for what it would be like to hear voices
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:34.480]   that are around you and in your head.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.960]   And you can't get out of it.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:42.280]   Are there other-- is Ninja theories other games like this?
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.160]   Or is this kind of an outlier?
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.400]   And the other games are just traditional combat?
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:49.720]   Yeah, the other games are traditional games that they have.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:54.600]   But they're coming up with a second cinema sacrifice.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.400]   I wonder how well it did.
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:57.480]   And to do well.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.480]   The kind of popular games.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.040]   It's quite a popular game.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.840]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:03.400]   I love--
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.240]   It's beautiful.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.640]   I love seeing stuff like this.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.880]   Because it's a unique way of thinking about gaming.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.360]   And I don't think--
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.960]   I'm done with first person shooters.
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.040]   You're just so violent.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.920]   And I want to try some other things that
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.720]   are as engaging as fun.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:22.160]   That's hard to do, fun.
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:26.360]   That's why I want to kill monsters in the Elden Ring.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.320]   Yeah, no, it's not why.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.840]   You don't play any games, do you, Lisa?
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.680]   I see you looking at us rolling your eyes, saying,
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.280]   go outside, get some fresh air.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:36.720]   It's a--
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.440]   No, I didn't roll my eyes.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:43.800]   It was-- it's like listening to people talk about, say,
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.960]   geology.
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.720]   I'm like, I love that you love rocks.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.920]   And you're able to use them to date
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.480]   the crust of the planet.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.320]   But I can't tell my shist from my felds bar.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:59.480]   You know, that's a common problem.
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.040]   And it's the same thing with gaming, where--
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.080]   oh my god, I just said it's sitting straight up.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:05.560]   I love it.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.920]   You're suddenly glowing.
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.920]   It looks like you're holding a human.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.320]   You should have the wings.
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:10.480]   You should get her the wings.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.440]   I'm going to stand here.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.720]   But here are the wings.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.600]   But with gaming, what I really love
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.960]   is hearing about how people get so engaged in it.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:21.000]   And everything from the intimate biological experience
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.480]   to the emotional engagement to your technological setup,
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.440]   it's fascinating.
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.760]   And it's something where I'm like, I love that you love that
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:29.280]   for you.
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.600]   Good for you.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:32.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:34.280]   You know, I feel the same way.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.080]   If I can see somebody's passion for something,
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.920]   even if I don't get it, I get it.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:40.720]   In that sense.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.960]   Yeah, although gaming--
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:44.160]   I get it because I like gaming.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:47.560]   I'm holding out hope that I'll find a gaming experience that
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.600]   clicks because I'd say, for example, I
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.600]   used to joke in the early 2000s that I just
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.480]   didn't get the point to radio.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:57.840]   And then I was in a job situation where I was commuting.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:58.640]   I was like, radio--
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.600]   Broadcast radio?
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:01.200]   You don't get the point of broadcast radio.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.680]   Well, no, I was going to say, Leo, this is my conversion story.
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.440]   You're going to break my heart.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:08.320]   No, this is my conversion story because I was like, eh,
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.080]   what is the point?
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:11.560]   We can read it on the web or we can read it period
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:12.560]   or there's video.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.920]   And then I was in a job situation
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:17.160]   where I had to commute for like 90 minutes each way every day.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.440]   And I got--
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:22.160]   and so I was listening to KQED.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.320]   And all of a sudden, after a month,
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:29.120]   you begin to recognize the conventions of narrative
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:32.840]   reporting through NPR or California report or marketplace.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:36.560]   And I began to really start admiring the music
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:39.080]   selections and how they move your mood
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:41.080]   and how efficiently information is imparted.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.880]   I'm like, oh, I get radio now.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.040]   I get the allure.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:44.800]   I get it.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:48.320]   And I'm sure that's going to happen with a game for me
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.040]   at some point.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:49.800]   It hasn't yet.
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:51.880]   But I'm open to the possibility.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:53.760]   And I hope I get there.
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.720]   All right, when we come back-- we're taking a break.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:00.040]   I want Owen and Georgia to make some recommendations for Lisa
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.120]   for a game that would grab her and get her into gaming.
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:06.760]   And so we can convert this person who is already
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.680]   walking into the light and get her all the way in.
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:15.440]   I can make one for you right now, Gileo.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.560]   Hold on.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.680]   Are you going to tell me ExpressVPN?
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.400]   I'm going to tell you what to do with my VPN.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.200]   I can tell.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:21.760]   I can tell.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.240]   I could see that.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.160]   My VPN.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.360]   My VPN.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:28.280]   His VPN, my VPN, ExpressVPN.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.000]   Using the internet without ExpressVPNs,
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.720]   like leaving your keys in the car while you're
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:34.680]   running the gas station for a snack.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:37.400]   You know, most of the time you come back, your car's there.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.080]   Sometimes you come back.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.520]   And there's a guy driving off.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:41.840]   And you're in your car.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.640]   You got to protect yourself every time you connect
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:49.440]   to an open network, an unencrypted network,
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.560]   cafes, hotels, airports.
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.120]   Anybody on that network can access your personal data,
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.560]   your financial details, your passwords.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.320]   Worse, they could do things like impersonate your home
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:05.520]   Wi-Fi access point so that your laptop goes, oh, we're home
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:06.720]   and joins it.
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.120]   And then you're on their network, baby.
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.120]   Doesn't take a lot of technical knowledge.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.800]   Just some cheap hardware.
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:15.400]   A smart 12-year-old could do it.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.040]   And of course, when you think about what they would do with
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.800]   that, they can make thousands of dollars selling
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.040]   your personal info.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.280]   They can make your life miserable.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.600]   You need a VPN.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.600]   There's so many good reasons to protect your privacy,
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:33.800]   to protect your security, to surf the internet in various
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:36.720]   places around the world so that you eliminate geographic
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:38.840]   restrictions on content.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.480]   ExpressVPN is an encrypted tunnel.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.480]   It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.160]   and the internet so that hackers can't steal your sensitive
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:48.360]   data.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.120]   They can't see your sensitive data.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:52.640]   They can't even see that it's you.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:56.720]   They just see gobbledygook flying through the air.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.800]   Because it's using strong encryption,
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.360]   it would take a hacker with a supercomputer more than a
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.840]   billion years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.720]   Until there's a hacker at the Starbucks using a quantum
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:10.040]   computer, I think we're OK.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.880]   Fire up the app, click a button, and you're protected.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.920]   That's the other thing I love about ExpressVPN.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.720]   94 countries, 160 locations.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.080]   They devote money to bandwidth so it's very fast, fast enough
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.000]   to watch HD video.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000]   You'll never complain.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.760]   In fact, you could put ExpressVPN on everything.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.320]   Phones, laptops, smart TVs, you can even put it on your
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:32.680]   router.
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:34.480]   And when you put it on your router, it's amazing because your
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.880]   whole family, your whole house is protected.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.000]   But I can guarantee you this.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.480]   No one's going to say, what happened to the internet?
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.240]   So slow.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.560]   It's the same.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:42.480]   They don't even know.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:44.040]   But they're safe.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:44.920]   They're secure.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.400]   I love that.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.400]   Secure your online data today by visiting
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.840]   expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.240]   When you go there, there's a list of the routers it works
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.880]   with, a list of the devices.
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:58.640]   Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.320]   Expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.960]   E-X-P-R-E-S-S.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:06.120]   vpn.com/twit.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.000]   When you buy a one-year package, you get three months free.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:08.760]   That's your best deal.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.880]   It brings down to below $7 a month.
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.400]   You want to pay for a VPN.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:13.120]   You got to trust me.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:17.040]   You do not want them to make money off of you.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.400]   You want to be the customer, not the product.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.440]   And you want them to invest in their networks.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.480]   You want them to rotate your IP addresses.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:25.640]   All of these make a VPN work better.
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:26.920]   Expressvpn does all of that.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.640]   And they are independently audited on a regular basis to
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:34.560]   make sure that they do exactly what they say, to verify
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.120]   their privacy policy, to verify this amazing, trusted server
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:38.880]   technology.
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.160]   There was a great write-up the other day on bleeping
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.360]   computer about Expressvpn.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:49.720]   And actually, I've been using Expressvpn for years.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:54.080]   I didn't even know how they work with this trusted server
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.240]   technology.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.960]   The article was because Expressvpn has a bug bounty of $100,000
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.920]   to the first person who can hack its servers.
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.520]   But in the article itself, they talked about how hard this
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:09.040]   is going to be.
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.880]   Expressvpn's trusted server custom built operating system
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.520]   based on Debian Linux, featuring proprietary security
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:19.480]   enhancements designed for VPN infrastructure.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.840]   It's RAM only.
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:26.520]   They periodically wipe the entire system.
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.760]   Every reboot, the whole thing starts over.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.960]   So no logging, no record of your visit.
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:36.640]   The system has built in verification that prevents
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.880]   insider code tampering events.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:41.480]   It's patched every week with clean installations on every
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:42.200]   server.
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:43.840]   How about that?
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.120]   So good luck.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.240]   The bug bounty has been going for six years, $100,000.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.960]   No one's collected it yet.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:51.840]   This is the one to use.
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:55.360]   Expressvpn.com/twitwethink.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.720]   I'm so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:01.360]   It's so good.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.760]   I have it on, honestly.
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:03.280]   You too.
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:04.360]   That's the key, right?
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.000]   I've had it for the last four or five years.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.880]   And I got it on all my devices.
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.400]   Legit, like you need to be a VPN.
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:10.200]   It's a great VPN.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.240]   And the price is right.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:11.960]   Price is right.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.760]   Yeah, baby.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.400]   So iOS 15.4, which is currently very--
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.000]   I think it's going to ship.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.120]   Well, so--
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.840]   actually, let's do a whole Apple thing.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:24.960]   Because there's a whole bunch of Apple news.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:28.480]   But it's all somewhat speculative.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:32.680]   I think 15.4 will come out March 8th, a week from Tuesday.
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.440]   The rumor is that's when Apple have an event.
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:37.480]   They'll announce their new iPhone SE with 5G.
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:40.240]   They'll announce a new iPad Air.
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.080]   iOS 15.4 will come out.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:47.360]   I'm hoping a Mac Mini will come out.
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:50.320]   But there will be a new voice on 15.4.
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.000]   I think this is great.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.320]   I've often wondered why it's a female voice
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:57.200]   on these voice assistants.
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:00.320]   I don't like that.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.720]   Apple has given us some choices.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:07.040]   They are introducing a new voice that is, in fact, not
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.240]   gendered at all.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:12.160]   Brilliant.
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.680]   About time.
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:19.080]   Apple says they hired somebody from the LGBTQ+ community
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.880]   to record this.
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:24.400]   Let me see if I can-- I'm trying to find an example of it.
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:29.160]   If you have 15.4, you've heard it.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.280]   And I have not heard it yet.
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.040]   I wanted to see it fine.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.640]   But I don't think anybody has the sample of it.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.480]   Gender-neutral voice option.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.120]   First of all, let me see if CNET has it.
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:44.440]   Nope.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:45.680]   Nobody.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:46.960]   Darn it.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.200]   I was hoping.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:48.920]   Yeah, it's Pat.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:49.960]   Somebody said, is it Pat?
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:50.560]   Yeah, it's Pat.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:53.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:54.120]   Could be a guy.
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:54.760]   Could be a gal.
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:55.320]   We don't know him.
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:57.280]   We don't care.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:00.920]   Do you think that's a good thing, Lisa, that--
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:03.240]   why should it be a female voice or even a male voice?
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:03.960]   It's a robot.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.800]   It's not a person.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.440]   I always reset my Siri to a British male voice anyway.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:15.480]   It makes me think of Jarvis from Iron Man, and I like that.
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:21.680]   I think that launching Siri as female, along with--
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.640]   and I believe Google Assistance, a now-girl voice,
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:27.320]   defaulted to female.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:27.800]   Right.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:33.560]   I think it said a lot about some of the baked-in cultural
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:38.880]   assumptions that the people developing these assistants
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:42.360]   had and chose not to examine.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:42.400]   Yes.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.840]   The fact that they defaulted to, we're
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.200]   going to make this assistant.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.160]   We're going to have it present as female.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:55.920]   And we think it's perfectly natural to have a female presenting
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:02.200]   technology subordinate to your desires and wishes
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.080]   and making your life easier.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:08.360]   I think that says a whole lot more about the culture inside tech
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.640]   companies and the culture inside development teams
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.120]   than perhaps they would like to admit.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:18.400]   I use voice 3.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.760]   And I didn't know this.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:20.960]   I just thought it sounded jolly.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:24.920]   It turns out Apple, when they added these two new voices,
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:27.200]   went to black voice actors.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:27.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.240]   Siri, choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.920]   I didn't think it's a black voice.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:33.680]   I just thought it's a jolly voice.
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.600]   I'm Siri.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:36.160]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:36.960]   And when he says OK--
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.000]   Someone like a Jake from Steak Farm guy.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:39.480]   It is.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.800]   It's like the-- maybe it is.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:43.520]   We don't know, because they never tell you who it is.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.160]   And when you ask him to do something,
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:46.440]   he says, OK.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.600]   It's like he's very cheerful.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.400]   Here's-- I found it.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:50.360]   This is from Macworld.
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:52.880]   This is very brief, but a little snippet
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.720]   of how the new voice sounds.
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:56.040]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.000]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:58.520]   Wow.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:02:59.480]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.000]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:01.800]   Sounds like an elf.
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:04.720]   Here's why I like it, is it sounds not human.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:06.960]   It doesn't sound human, which I like.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.200]   I like that, because first of all,
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:13.520]   it's a nice way to sidestep all of the weird--
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:14.360]   Because it's not a human.
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.120]   --and it's a baggage.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:16.520]   Yeah, I mean, a human recorded.
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:17.760]   But it's a robot.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:18.680]   You're talking to a robot.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.960]   It helps you remember that it's a piece of assistive technology
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.400]   that augments the human sphere.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.680]   Do you encourage your daughter to treat Siri like a human
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:28.200]   or like a robot?
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:31.360]   So what I've tried to do is model
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:34.280]   how you should talk to Siri and Google Assistant
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.640]   with things like Siri, could you please set a timer
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:38.280]   for 10 minutes?
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.080]   Or if Siri answers it, query for us in the car.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080]   I'll say thank you, Siri.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.880]   So you're polite.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.480]   You say please and thank you.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:47.440]   Well, yes, yes.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.280]   And also because these are--
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:51.760]   with all your social interactions,
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.960]   you should be trying this, right?
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.320]   That said, one of the things that I thought was--
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:56.520]   But it's not human.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:58.120]   Well, it doesn't matter that it's not a human.
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:03:59.800]   You're having discourse with it.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.200]   Are you?
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:02.200]   And if you want to--
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.600]   When I type a command--
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:04.120]   Not all--
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.280]   --on the command line.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.400]   When I say pseudo apt to get--
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.560]   I don't say please.
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:12.080]   Well, here's the thing.
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.640]   That's you in the text, and that's a little bubble inside your head.
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:17.400]   There's no other interaction involved.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.640]   But if you're modeling a conversation--
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:23.360]   and not all conversations have to be like the one we're having now,
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:25.560]   or we're striving to exchange ideas and come
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.280]   to a common understanding, sometimes it's
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.000]   just an information exchange.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.280]   And if you have those-- and you do have those information
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.480]   exchanges with people, so why wouldn't you model the kind of behavior
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:38.760]   that you hope somebody applies to a person-to-person information
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:38.760]   exchange--
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.480]   --developed good habits--
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.400]   --person-to-technology.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.400]   --developed good habits.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:42.400]   Because it's a habit.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   But--
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.640]   It's the same way you always drink a glass of water,
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.440]   or you make sure you always have protons with a meal,
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.160]   things like that.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.160]   It's just another good habit.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:51.680]   But you did point out that the good thing about this voice--
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:52.520]   I'm Siri.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:53.600]   --choose the voice you'd like me to--
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:54.480]   --is doesn't sound human.
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:56.400]   It kind of reminds you it's not a human.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.000]   And I think you're doing it.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.400]   And so that's the argument against saying
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:01.040]   a kid's treated like a human.
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:05.280]   No, I think there's ever a bad time to model courtesy,
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.560]   not to animals, not in any sort of exchange--
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:08.880]   --be nice into the robots.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.160]   They deserve it.
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:11.000]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   There's a really good short story.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:16.720]   I can't remember if I found the link off boing boing.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.920]   But the premise was that in the short story,
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.960]   there was a guy who actually really enjoyed
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:26.000]   being verbally abusive to his AI assistant,
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.520]   setting up to present his female and being abusive with it.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:31.640]   And then the AI was like, oh, oh, is this how we're playing?
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:33.360]   I'll show you.
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.320]   That's Scarlett Johansson in a nutshell.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.320]   I got to tell you.
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.480]   No, but there's a little bit of that where I'm like, OK,
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:39.760]   eventually the technology is going
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:41.680]   to get to the point where it's going to either reward you
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:44.200]   for interactions or it's going to deter them.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:47.160]   The robots will remember is what you're saying.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:48.880]   Well, I'm not saying they'll remember on their own.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:51.160]   I'm going to say somebody's going to find a way to--
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.840]   To get you back.
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:54.160]   Well, yeah, because they're going to get
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.120]   this behavior modification, or this behavior
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:56.880]   incentives.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:59.760]   Georgia, where do you come down on this?
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:01.720]   Well, I think it's just a good habit.
[02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.920]   They're not human, and that's fine.
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:07.960]   But I think that if you want to model behavior,
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.320]   it's so close.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:12.320]   Our brain does not know the difference between conversation
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.120]   with a human and not with a human,
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.480]   because that's not the way that our brains have not
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:19.640]   changed almost at all in 150,000 years.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.280]   So if you want your children to practice being polite,
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:25.240]   and since they're interacting so much with technology,
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:28.400]   they should be a polite across every single scale
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.480]   of conversation so that when they feel frustrated and upset,
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:34.760]   which since I'm interacting with Siri, is a lot of the time,
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:37.200]   they can do that and deal with that frustration
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:39.560]   and still be polite instead of wanting to say--
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:42.280]   Siri, you're a dip head, please.
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:45.080]   In my head, I say horrible things to Siri.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.440]   In my head, I say that loud.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.920]   I try not to say outwardly horrible things to Siri.
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:50.920]   I swear it's--
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.760]   And it's great.
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:55.400]   I think that it's wonderful to have different choices of voices.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:00.160]   I think that being represented is really important.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:04.920]   And I think that the fact that matters a lot,
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:08.040]   that Siri still doesn't understand intonation
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:10.960]   that if I'm whispering, don't shout back at me.
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.760]   That might be a really good idea.
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.320]   Who is it? Echo now does that.
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:16.680]   If you whispered Echo, it whispers back.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:17.720]   It has a bedtime voice.
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:19.320]   Or don't say anything at all.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.880]   I don't need you to tell me, yes, I shut off all the lights.
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:23.920]   Honestly, I don't want them to be more human.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.040]   I want them to be more robotic.
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:28.560]   So I like this voice, because I don't want them.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.640]   I want it to be clear.
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:30.200]   I'm Siri.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.600]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:33.560]   Sounds like we represent the--
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:34.560]   I don't know.
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.560]   I think that one eventually--
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.200]   So what I think is really interesting
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:39.840]   is my daughter will pit Google Assistant and Siri
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.280]   against each other, where she'll ask them both the questions.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:43.360]   She knows.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:43.920]   She knows.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:45.080]   She'll ask them both the question
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:46.840]   and just see how they answer it.
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:49.280]   And I find it really interesting that she's always
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.240]   testing to see which assistant is more
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:53.360]   useful and legitimate to her needs.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:55.560]   Like there's just some sort of technoskepticism
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.240]   that she seems--
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:58.040]   I don't know where she got it from, but I'm glad she's not--
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:58.560]   I like it.
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:00.440]   No, that's good.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.520]   My kids are old enough.
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.720]   I didn't have to teach them this.
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:04.120]   My God.
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:05.240]   I didn't have to-- this didn't come up.
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:07.280]   Oh, and you're raising a ninja.
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:11.320]   Do you tell your ninja to treat Siri like a lady or kicker
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:12.480]   in the butt?
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:13.520]   Lisa's got me all.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.480]   I got to go sit down with Georgia
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:16.800]   and think about my mindset.
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:19.360]   First of all, my mindset, I was thinking
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:21.800]   the reason it's a female voice is because women
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:23.960]   should be running a planet because men screw up everything.
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:26.200]   And nobody wants to hear somebody man explaining to me
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:27.400]   how they didn't turn all eyes.
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:28.880]   I read it all if it's a parkerful.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:29.800]   I don't know if it's a parkerful.
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.800]   It's funny to be the worst.
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:33.400]   The Air Force for years.
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:34.680]   Let me hear what I'm saying.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.160]   Wait a minute.
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.280]   I just want to say this.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:37.720]   Parenthetically, Air Force for years
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:40.560]   has used female voices in the heads up displays.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:44.160]   Pull up, pull up, pull up, because they thought men
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:45.720]   listened to their mothers.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:46.280]   My mom.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:46.760]   Yes.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.760]   Oh, my God.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:50.640]   And if they're blacking out, they're redding out,
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.840]   if they hear their mom saying, pull up, pull up.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:53.840]   Oh, my God.
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:54.840]   My mom's coming to you.
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:55.840]   My mom's coming to you.
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:58.680]   Oh, all the things positive and negative, women
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:08:59.720]   can motivate men.
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.440]   And generally, anyone to do anything.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:03.000]   So that's where I thought it was from.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.640]   Now I'm thinking to myself, am I in the patriarchy of men?
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:08.880]   I guess if Arnold Schwarzenegger told me, pull up, pull up,
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.440]   I would pull up.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:14.640]   Secondly, the other issue is, you know what?
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:17.800]   I've cussed out my GPS, my PlayStation, my computer,
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:19.040]   my Google, my everything.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:19.720]   It's a robot.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:21.720]   I'm not saying, please, or thank you.
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:22.640]   I agree.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:23.000]   I agree.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.360]   I run this city up here.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:25.280]   And that's the voice.
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:25.720]   Annoying.
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:26.880]   It's not even a robot voice.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.080]   If you want to give me a robot voice, give me a real--
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.920]   There's plenty of examples and movies of a robotic voice.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:33.920]   I would like a robot voice.
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.360]   I'm going to be like, how?
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:35.880]   Yeah.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:36.520]   I'm going to be like, how?
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:38.080]   That would make me listen.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.080]   Pull up.
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.640]   If you're going to get a radio, that's funny.
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:42.600]   That's the voice I need.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.960]   Otherwise, you just keep the women telling me what to do,
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:47.320]   because I like listening to women.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.360]   It's just me.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.480]   It's because I've had attention.
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:50.800]   If a dude tell me to do something like that,
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:52.240]   I don't need nobody else man playing with me.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.600]   I don't want man playing to everybody else.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.480]   I got time to listen to somebody and tell me
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:56.680]   what to do with myself.
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:57.600]   What do you not say?
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:01.040]   What does Bender's voice sound like?
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.640]   John DeMaggio.
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:03.120]   Let me see.
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:03.880]   Let me play a little bit.
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:04.840]   He sounds like a person, because I've
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.600]   heard him character acting something else.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:08.120]   I instantly know who that is when I hear him.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:08.800]   Hey, everybody.
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.560]   I'm John DeMaggio.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.720]   You may know me as the voice of Bender,
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:15.920]   you know, the lovable skip from future weeks.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:17.440]   He sounds like a human.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:18.440]   Yeah.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:19.040]   He sounds like--
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.600]   He sounds like kind of a lovable skip.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:22.720]   See, I don't want glados.
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:23.520]   If I could choose--
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:25.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:26.600]   Let's do this.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:29.400]   I used to have my Tom Tom, because you could do celebrity
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:32.800]   voices, used to have the GLADOS voice.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:34.280]   And she would lie to you.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:34.920]   She would say turn--
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:35.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:37.480]   It was not a good choice.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:38.720]   No, really?
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:40.600]   Yeah, she would say turn left here when you're
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:42.280]   supposed to turn right.
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:43.600]   Oh my god, really?
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:44.400]   Yeah.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:45.520]   That's hilarious.
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.680]   Here's GLADOS from the game Portal.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.160]   By the way, a great game coming back.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.040]   Portal is now-- I think it's now on the switch.
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:56.320]   Oh, it's you.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:59.200]   It's been a long time.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:00.760]   How have you been?
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:02.720]   I've been really busy.
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:05.320]   So they do some auto-tune stuff with that, right?
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:05.920]   Yeah.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.320]   That's good.
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:11.240]   I would like GLADOS to be my echo or Siri.
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.840]   I would like that.
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:15.560]   That's how a robot should sound.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:18.320]   And then you could swear at it.
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.440]   Well, I pay for Samuel Jackson.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:21.880]   I pay him a $2.99.
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.880]   And he was husting.
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:24.440]   Auto-live a long day was great.
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:24.920]   I'd just wake up--
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:25.600]   Ask him.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:26.120]   Ask him.
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:26.920]   Ask him.
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:27.320]   Ask him.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:27.840]   Listen.
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:30.440]   Say Samuel, why do you cuss so much?
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:31.000]   What?
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.920]   And then come back, by the way.
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:35.160]   I don't know if it was a gag.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.880]   But when I had other people come over, I would tell him, hey,
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:39.320]   I got Samuel Jackson.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:40.160]   Why is this?
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:43.680]   And he would never curse when other people were there.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.200]   Oh, he was shy.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:47.120]   I'm like, what is going on?
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.800]   Like, people thought I was going to literally 20 people
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:50.680]   I was trying to tell.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.800]   I was calling people on the phone, like, listen to this.
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.680]   And he went-- I don't know what it do.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:56.440]   But the news I was trying to show off,
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:59.120]   and he would not cuss when somebody else was present.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:11:59.920]   Drove me crazy.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.880]   I deactivated him.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:03.000]   I want my $2.99 back.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:03.680]   I want it back.
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:09.560]   I have a message for you from Glados.
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:10.840]   Hey, let me see if I can get her.
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:12.160]   You can type in what you wanted to say?
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:15.560]   Oh, there's so many people.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:16.400]   Here we go.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:18.280]   You ready?
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.320]   Oh, no, it's still thinking.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.840]   There's so many people playing it.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:26.560]   It takes a minute and a half to process it.
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:29.000]   This is a Glados voice generator,
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.800]   glados.c-net.org, based on text clips.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.680]   And I wrote something in.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.000]   We'll edit it into the show later.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.760]   It'll seem like it happened immediately.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:43.800]   It'll be incredible.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:44.800]   They're right.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.800]   You're literally laughing.
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:48.120]   You're like, I know the truth.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.040]   It takes a minute and a half to do this, I guess.
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:53.560]   And now that I've mentioned it on the air,
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.560]   it's never going to work.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560]   So yeah.
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.320]   So it's like, they're just excited.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:12:59.360]   So I told you they know, they know.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:03.400]   There is nothing like a human voice for some things.
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:05.560]   Like for instance, audible.com.
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.760]   I want a human voice to read to me, right?
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:14.720]   But I don't want a human voice on my Amazon Echo or my Siri.
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:17.520]   I like the idea of it sounding like a robot.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:20.920]   Because I think it's why I think it's important to teach kids.
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:23.040]   Yes, you want to get them in the habit of pleasing.
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:24.120]   And thank you.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:25.120]   That's important.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.640]   I had a guy call me the other day, call me sir on the radio show.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:29.640]   Sir, sir, sir.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.640]   I said, are you in the military?
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.560]   He said, no, I'm just polite.
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:36.520]   But he was, I, you know, in fact, an't prove it.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.320]   We'll call people Mr. and Miss and all that.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:39.320]   I like that.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.840]   I think it's a southern thing.
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:43.200]   But yeah, it's the self.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.040]   But you got to know, but you got to know the difference between a human and a robot.
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:52.080]   And I think the other thing kids need to learn is these are not humans.
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:53.360]   You might feel like it.
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.360]   You might emotion.
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.800]   I don't, I worry about a kid getting, I know intellectually they know, but I worry about
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:03.000]   them getting some sort of emotional sense that I'm interacting.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.080]   It's easy to get in that, I think.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.560]   And I think it's important that they know the distinction.
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:10.160]   Have you watched the movie, her?
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.160]   Yes.
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.680]   He fell in love with her.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:13.840]   He fell in love with her.
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:14.840]   Yes.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:15.840]   That is the future.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:19.320]   That, that, that's just coming out of the Bible with all this AI and natural reaction
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:24.720]   and expression and wanting to have things feel more natural like that, that AI robot
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.480]   they have that people are saying they freaked out.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:27.880]   He fell in love with her, right?
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:29.680]   Yeah, he fell in love with her.
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:34.440]   And it's just merging areas of researching call centers is how to get AIs that can read
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:38.680]   sentiment and respond to both small talk and for fanity.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.680]   Yes.
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.000]   Well, the idea is that if you get the AIs that read what you can do is you can actually
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.880]   move the customers to more effective person to person interactions later.
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:49.200]   So that an agent is like, okay, watch him.
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:51.520]   This guy's coming in hot or what have you.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:57.520]   But I find it so interesting that we're going to have basically the suite of technical tools
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:02.680]   that's going to try to meet people where they are emotionally and then move them to a different
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:05.520]   place emotionally in the service of a customer transaction.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.800]   That's so manipulative.
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:10.760]   It's so, it's so wild that this is what people want to do with the technology.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:11.760]   Here's Glados.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.840]   Let's see if I can go.
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.600]   Oh, when you're crazy, we only cuss when you're in the room.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:19.120]   That's sort of glad I see.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:22.040]   By the way, I should have never mentioned it.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.560]   And then there's hundreds of people using it.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.520]   And it's never going to work for any of them.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.520]   I'm sorry.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.400]   All right, let's take a break because I mentioned Audible and I should probably talk about them.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.040]   They are our sponsor for this segment.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:42.880]   And I tell you what, you know, I have a Kindle that we'll read by a robotic voice.
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:44.720]   We'll interpret the text.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.120]   I have lots of ways to do that.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:51.120]   They're getting better and better, but there is nothing like a real reader.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:53.400]   And that's what Audible is all about.
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:16:00.400]   Audiobooks performed, not read, performed by some of the best performers in the world.
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:06.040]   In fact, when you get a celebrity audio book, a biography or autobiography, often they'll
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:07.040]   read it.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:08.760]   Steve Martin reading, born standing up.
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:09.960]   It's like he's in the room.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:11.120]   It's fantastic.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.960]   But experts talking to you like they're in the room.
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:18.600]   Audible has more than just audio books, more than just celebrity memoirs.
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:20.360]   They've got mysteries and thrillers.
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.040]   They've got self-help, motivation, wellness.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:24.360]   They've got business.
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:30.400]   They've got podcasts, thousands of them from popular favorites plus exclusive new series.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.280]   And as a member, you get full access to their growing selection of included audio books
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:37.880]   that you can download or stream all you want.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:39.240]   We were watching The Gilded Age.
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:47.680]   And I thought, I have a craving for one of those great kind of Gilded Era 1910 novels
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:49.080]   by Edith Wharton.
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:54.120]   I downloaded The House of Mirth's beautiful reader, famous British actress.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.640]   Can't remember her name right now.
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.760]   But it was part of my Audible subscription.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:59.120]   And then you have to pay for it.
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:00.960]   It was so fantastic.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.480]   I just love that.
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.560]   A full access to a growing selection of included audio books that you can download or stream
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:07.560]   all you want.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.640]   Audible gives members a chance to listen to and discover new favorites and explore different
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:13.120]   formats.
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:16.240]   And that's part of what makes your membership so much more valuable.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:20.480]   Things like the exclusive words plus music series or maybe a podcast you never thought
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:25.200]   of or consider before theatrical performances, you could go to Broadway.
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.920]   And as an Audible member, you could choose a title a month that you get to keep from
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.920]   their entire catalog, including the latest bestsellers and new releases.
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:36.080]   Let me show you the one I listened to.
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:38.840]   This is so good.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:41.120]   The House of Mirth Eleanor Braun.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.120]   That's who it is.
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.120]   Edith Wharton's.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.120]   And listen to her.
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:45.120]   She's so beautiful.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:46.120]   This is so good.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.720]   Selden paused in surprise.
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.160]   In the afternoon rush of the Grand Central Station, his eyes had been refreshed by the
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.800]   site of Miss Lily Bart.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.800]   Oh, Lily Bart.
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:58.600]   Goss me nothing was included in my Audible membership.
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:02.080]   Audible Studios did this one.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.520]   If you, if you liked that, the, the Gilded Age on HBO, you're going to, this is even
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:07.520]   better.
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:10.440]   I just got the Bobaverse Steve Gibson's been raving.
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:13.360]   Have you guys read any of the Bobaverse?
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:15.360]   He's been raving about it.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.480]   Let me play a little bit of that.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:18.480]   That's the other thing.
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:19.480]   Look, I'm streaming.
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:21.520]   You can stream from your browser here.
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:22.520]   I'll play a sample.
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:23.520]   There we go.
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:24.520]   Good.
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:25.520]   You're awake.
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.360]   I tried to respond, but what came out with something like a cross between a cough and
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:30.360]   static.
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:31.760]   Recognize that voice?
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:34.240]   Do you know Ray Porter's voice?
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:41.720]   I know you do because he does Project Hail Mary, the latest Andy Weir audio book.
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:44.000]   I just love Ray Porter.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.160]   He does all the Bobaverse as well.
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.040]   2022, big for Audible.
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:53.880]   They're celebrating our newfound self awareness and making positive change.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.920]   Audible helps make space for what matters to you.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.800]   It's a destination for your wellness, whether you're looking to soul search, be inspired,
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:03.840]   look toward new goals, unwind, or simply be entertained.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:08.040]   We've had some time in the last couple of years to figure out what truly makes us happy.
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:12.480]   I'll tell you what, I couldn't have survived pandemic without Audible.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:18.480]   And believe me, going into the future, Audible will always be my companion.
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:20.880]   You can always find the best of what you love or something new to discover.
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.360]   New members, try Audible.
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:27.240]   I don't know if there could possibly be anybody who listens to this show who is not yet a
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.240]   member.
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:33.240]   I love them.

[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.240]   Download the Audible app.

[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:00.720]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:02.280]   We have a promo.
[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:03.640]   We don't like to call them promos.
[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:06.040]   We like to call them mini movies, recapping.
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:08.040]   Some of the things you may have missed this week.
[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:09.040]   Onto it.
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:16.560]   I wanted to hang out with Mr. Owen J. J. Stone, also known as O Doctor, also known as Pain
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:17.560]   in My Neck.
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:22.560]   I can't hear him.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:31.560]   Sorry, your mind's cut.
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:34.560]   Previously, did you take over?
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:35.560]   Security now.
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:40.200]   What I do, we consider the implications of the technology behind last week's denial of
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.880]   service attacks on some of Ukraine's critical infrastructure.
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:52.480]   What the world saw a week ago in Ukraine was an HTTPS query-capable botnet flexing its
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.480]   muscles.
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:55.160]   Tech News Weekly.
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:58.920]   I want to talk about Amazon's Astro Home robot.
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:01.480]   I found two people in the world with the Astro.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:03.040]   Contacted both of them.
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:04.040]   Only got one reply.
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:06.800]   Only two people posting about a thousand dollar device.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:08.840]   It means there's very few in the world.
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:13.000]   To be honest with you, I believe there's between 50 and 100 in the wild.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.000]   Windows Weekly.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.520]   When you flash forward to Windows 11, they're saying, "Hey, look, we're going to let you
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.800]   install Windows 11.
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:19.800]   We get it."
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:24.400]   Now, we may, at some point, stop delivering security updates, right?
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:27.040]   There's no promises, but we're going to let you do this for now.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:31.960]   They're going to put a watermark on your desktop telling you that this computer is not supported.
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:33.440]   Like for what?
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:34.440]   Why?
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:35.440]   What does it do?
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:40.120]   Or you put a sticky note on your screen to hold the watermark.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.120]   Yep.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:44.560]   If it really bothers you that much, I know.
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:45.560]   Wait a minute.
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:53.280]   Was that my Bitcoin password that I saw there?
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:55.880]   If you missed anything this week, we had a lot of fun.
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:00.760]   Again, Owen, you were great and they asked me anything.
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:03.280]   Paul Thorett himself will be coming up next month.
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.960]   Antiproids doing a great job putting together some fun stuff for our...
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:09.040]   He's making himself useful.
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.600]   He's making himself useful.
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:12.400]   By the way, I've been...
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.240]   What is the microphone you're using these days, Owen?
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.240]   That's a different look at Mike.
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:16.240]   What is that?
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.240]   This is...
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.240]   I switched up.
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:19.240]   It sounds good.
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:24.040]   I usually use these, but I just had a new reason, an engine today, and my daughter saw
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.040]   the podcast.
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:26.040]   So I switched up.
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.120]   This is the little pod, road, mic thing, the little tiny one.
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:30.920]   But the big ones are road as well, right?
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:32.320]   Yeah, they're all roads.
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:33.320]   They're both roads.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:34.320]   Yeah.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:35.320]   My other mic is AKG.
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:36.320]   I'm like you.
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:37.320]   I got too much stuff.
[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:40.560]   So every once in a while, I like to switch it up, give my voice a little bit more depth.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.560]   Yeah.
[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:42.560]   Check it out.
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:44.320]   See if it works better for me.
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:45.320]   It is.
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:46.320]   Okay.
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:47.320]   Oh, that's what I do.
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:48.320]   All right.
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:49.320]   And look at this.
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:50.320]   Look at this.
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:51.320]   Look at this.
[02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:52.320]   Is that Georgia?
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.320]   It's so cute.
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:55.080]   It's Turbo Man.
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:56.080]   Turbo Man.
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:58.480]   Who's Turbo Man?
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:22:59.480]   You don't know about Turbo Man?
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:00.480]   You were talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger earlier.
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:04.040]   Arnold Schwarzenegger in that movie, but he was trying to get the Turbo Man doll.
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:05.440]   What was it called?
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:06.440]   The Christmas movie.
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:07.920]   Everybody's trying to get the Turbo Man.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:08.920]   Dang it.
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:09.920]   All the way.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:10.920]   Is that?
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:11.920]   That sounds about right.
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:12.920]   That sounds about right.
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:14.800]   You're trying to get the toy.
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.960]   That's the toy everybody's trying to get.
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:20.200]   You know, I finally understand what it's what it means to get old.
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:23.200]   The young people around you will be talking about things you have.
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:24.200]   You just go.
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:25.200]   I don't know what you're.
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.920]   Well, that you live in a whole different hyperspace.
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:30.000]   You and Tom Merrick are going to my nerves anyway.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.760]   Somebody asked you about a diode from 1983 that I know about.
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:34.760]   I can tell you.
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:37.120]   I can tell the shifts from the fault spark.
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:38.120]   Exactly.
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:39.120]   I know the difference.
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:42.160]   Just pop your brakes on what you do and don't know.
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:45.160]   Your brain's kind of full of some sort of information.
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:52.320]   I love that when you said that, by the way, Lisa, because my father was a geologist and
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:59.240]   you bet I could tell the shift from the fault spark on sight.
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:03.400]   I feel like it's the Miss Off were part of the brain.
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.680]   I went on a boat tour in Crater Lake.
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:07.040]   We went to Crater Lake National Park.
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:12.040]   You on the boat tour, you see the log that's been floating there for years.
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:13.840]   The park ranger who did our boat tour.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:18.360]   They give you a tour of a log that's been floating in the lake.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:19.600]   Well, the log is like a feature.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:25.000]   You basically go in the middle of the lake to look around and be amazed at this volcanic
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.800]   caldera that you're in.
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:29.680]   But the feature is the log floating?
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:30.680]   Yes.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.240]   It's called the old man.
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:35.080]   The reason it's a big deal is Crater Lake is so cold.
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:37.800]   It's just a few degrees about freezing.
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:42.200]   Because it doesn't have any water source that flows in or flows out.
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:45.080]   It's like a giant ice cube.
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:46.080]   Yes.
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:51.520]   This log has been bobbing around in the lake for decades upon decades.
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:55.200]   I forget exactly how long I'm going to have to Google that one.
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:56.520]   Here's a picture.
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.520]   The old man of the lake.
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:00.520]   It's floating.
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:01.520]   That's not like a pier.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:03.240]   That's just a floating piece of wood.
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.360]   It floats vertically.
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:06.360]   That's it.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:07.360]   Yes.
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:15.400]   How has a giant hemlock managed to float upright and clear for more than 100 years?
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:16.400]   Manufacturers.
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:20.360]   The water is bloody cold is what it is.
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:25.120]   The ranger who was leading us around the boat happened to have a PhD in geology.
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:29.800]   He's completely nerding out explaining to us, "Oh, this happened when the dinosaurs were
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:30.800]   walking in the earth."
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:31.800]   Wow.
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:32.800]   That's cool.
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:33.800]   I love that.
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:37.920]   He's dropping all of these technical terms and I was like, "How lucky we are."
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:40.720]   I won't remember any of this because it just...
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.720]   Nope.
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:43.720]   There's not enough room in the head.
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:46.760]   I don't have room in the brain anymore.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:47.840]   One thing goes in.
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:49.040]   Something goes out.
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.000]   Like paleozoic, mesozoic.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]   Don't eat it.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000]   Don't eat it.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000]   Yeah.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.000]   Cretaceous.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.000]   Oh, I know all others.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.000]   Exactly.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.280]   There's this luring period and the waterfiche period and the cambrian period.
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:04.280]   They all just kind of jumbled together and so I'm like, "Okay, we can look at rocks and
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.280]   figure out how old things are and that's great.
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:08.200]   That's just going to be a skillset I don't have."
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:09.800]   There's Mount Mazama.
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:11.800]   Oh, is this also a crater?
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:15.600]   John's a big fan of craters.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:21.920]   That's the volcano that blew up in Oregon and made Crater Lake.
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:24.480]   Maybe the old man of the lake was in that volcano.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:25.480]   We don't know.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:26.480]   That is...
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:27.480]   That's a fascinating...
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:35.800]   Does the ranger understand the kind of the irony of the fact that you're going in a boat
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.080]   in this lake and he says, "And there's the old man of the lake, a log that's been floating
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.480]   here for a hundred years.
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.320]   Does he understand the irony of that or does he just do it straight?"
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:46.320]   He doesn't straight.
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:47.320]   He doesn't straight.
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:48.320]   He doesn't straight.
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:52.160]   They have their work cut out for them because they have to remind you repeatedly, "Please don't
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:53.320]   go into the lake.
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:54.320]   It's almost freezing."
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:55.320]   Is it that cold?
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:56.320]   Wow.
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:57.320]   What are in or out?
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:26:59.640]   Why does it not just evaporate?
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.040]   I don't remember.
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:02.040]   Maybe there's ice.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:03.040]   Maybe there's melt.
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:04.040]   Yeah.
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:05.040]   Oh, rain.
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:06.040]   They have rain up there.
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:07.040]   Okay.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:08.040]   There you go.
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:09.040]   And it snows.
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:11.680]   The photos that come out of Crater Lake National Park in the winter are amazing.
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:13.680]   It's like a second sign in.
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:15.880]   Now I've got to go see the old man of the lake.
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:18.400]   Yeah, just get yourself on the boat tour.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.720]   You'll go buy it.
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:24.160]   You'll be tempted to try to reach out your arm and touch it and they'll be like, "No,
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:25.160]   don't."
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:27.080]   They get mad if you try to touch it.
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:28.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.080]   It'd be really embarrassing if you touched it and sank.
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:31.080]   Yeah.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:34.080]   It'd be like, "You were falling and you're holding on to the lake."
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:35.080]   You're falling out of the lake.
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:36.080]   It grew in debt.
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:37.720]   It was perfectly vertical.
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:38.720]   It is phenomenal.
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:39.720]   Great to do.
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:40.720]   Yeah.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:41.720]   Great to do.
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:42.720]   What are you in for, man?
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:44.080]   I committed murder.
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.640]   I sank the old man of the lake.
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:47.640]   What?
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:49.640]   I caused it to flood horizontally.
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:50.640]   But yeah, I tilted it.
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:51.640]   It tilted over.
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:52.640]   Oh, boy.
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:53.640]   Oh, boy.
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:54.640]   Oh, boy.
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:55.640]   Oh, boy.
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:58.060]   Well, we've actually run out of...
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:27:59.260]   This has never happened before.
[02:27:59.260 --> 02:28:02.280]   We've run out of stories before we ran out of show.
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:07.480]   So I stalled for as long as I could, but I just couldn't keep it going.
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:09.000]   I guess I have to take off my clothes.
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000]   I don't know.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.160]   No, I wouldn't do that.
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:12.160]   You're already streaked.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:13.160]   That would be terrible.
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:14.760]   You mean you wouldn't do that again?
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.760]   Once is enough.
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:18.280]   Oh, I believe you guys were supposed to give me gaming recommendations.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:19.280]   Ah!
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.400]   I knew there was something we were coming back to do.
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:24.640]   So we want to get Lisa into gaming.
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:27.160]   I personally, I'm a big fan of Valheim.
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:28.520]   It's about building.
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:30.160]   It's about being a Viking.
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:32.120]   It's beautiful sunsets.
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:34.920]   It's occasional attacks for strange things.
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:38.400]   But most of the time you're just hanging, chilling with the Vikings.
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:40.040]   My favorite.
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.640]   What do you recommend to get Lisa into games?
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:45.400]   A brutal exploration and survival game, I'm told.
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:46.400]   It's not that brutal.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:47.400]   It's not.
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:48.400]   It's not.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:49.400]   It's procedurally generated.
[02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:51.120]   What does procedurally generated mean?
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:52.640]   It means it's different every time.
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:54.480]   And so there's different seeds.
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:59.920]   You can, the best thing though, is to get a group of like Girl Scouts together in a
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:02.680]   server and all play cooperatively.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:04.240]   And you can honestly do more build.
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:08.040]   It's more like Minecraft than it is like Call of Duty.
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:09.840]   It's a beautiful game.
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:10.840]   I really like it.
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:11.840]   Yeah, I don't want to shoot him up game.
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:12.840]   I don't want to eat.
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:13.840]   No, I don't want to eat.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:14.840]   I'm just going to stress pull a little.
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:16.840]   That's why I should also recommend Wirtle.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:20.680]   Wait, the one that just got bought by New York Times.
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:23.960]   Sometimes that could be dramatic.
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:27.480]   Lisa and I, it is our new nighttime, my Lisa.
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:28.480]   Not Lisa.
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:29.480]   Yeah, not me.
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:30.560]   I don't know her that way.
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:33.360]   It's our new nighttime ritual.
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:37.000]   Before we turn out the lights and go to sleep, we do the Wirtle.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000]   It's really fun.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.480]   It's kind of never done Wirtle.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.000]   I will never do Wirtle.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000]   I've never done Wirtle.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.320]   I did not find that fun.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:54.320]   So what do you recommend then?
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:57.120]   For Lisa, what do you want to get?
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:58.120]   I don't know.
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:30:00.800]   It depends on what you really enjoy.
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:05.120]   Gaming, it should be towards something that you already enjoy doing.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:06.680]   So for me, it's just stress relief.
[02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:07.680]   I want something mindless.
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:08.680]   I can come in.
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:09.680]   I can come out.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:10.680]   I don't have to worry.
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:12.440]   I get a little bit of dopamine from whatever.
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:13.440]   I'm with you.
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:18.840]   A candy crush, a jean, or a doing a puzzle solver like the room where you're in an area
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:19.840]   and you have to find the skin.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:20.840]   You can use and put them away.
[02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:27.320]   It's just a really fun, beautiful, easy to start and end game or all play people against
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:28.320]   boggle.
[02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:31.080]   I like quick and easy games.
[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:34.120]   Those really long, expansive games.
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:36.760]   I don't have the time to be able to go through it.
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:39.040]   Lisa, it seems like you're doing a million different things.
[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:42.680]   I don't think that you'd have a lot of time to be able to do a game that you're going
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:45.400]   to have to spend a lot of effort in doing.
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:49.320]   So I would say something that's more kind of like a casual, something that's good for
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:52.960]   your brain and you're doing whatever words with friends or other things where you can
[02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:57.840]   kind of have a little cute little competition going, but it isn't something that's really
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:01.040]   serious or that's going to take up a lot of time.
[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.040]   Good idea.
[02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:04.040]   Yeah.
[02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:05.040]   Casual gaming.
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:06.040]   iPad, iPhone style.
[02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:07.040]   Yeah.
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:08.680]   That makes a lot of sense.
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:10.880]   It keeps your brain active.
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:13.520]   Owen, what do you think?
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:16.600]   As usual, Lisa, I don't know if you've noticed this, but I'm the person that comes in with
[02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:18.840]   the correct answer for you, okay?
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:19.840]   I love it.
[02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:20.840]   His doctor voice.
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:22.840]   He's doing his doctor voice.
[02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:23.840]   He's doing the doctor.
[02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:24.840]   Yeah, that's the best.
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:25.840]   I love it.
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:29.360]   Your children have Nintendo switches.
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:31.880]   The first thing, Mario Kart, okay?
[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:32.880]   Oh, yes.
[02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:33.880]   I'm sure you have a vehicle.
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:34.880]   Yes.
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:39.160]   I'm sure that a little bit of competition will get the blood going and when you shoot a
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:43.400]   turtle out of a kid and he's screaming cry when they're about to make first place and
[02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:44.400]   he didn't come out.
[02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:45.400]   There's no greater voice.
[02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:47.160]   I know you said you don't want violence.
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:48.160]   It's true.
[02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:49.160]   It's just a turtle.
[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:50.160]   It's just a turtle.
[02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:51.160]   Oh, no.
[02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:54.960]   It's not violent until the kids get upset and that's the kind of violence I enjoy.
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:59.680]   Meghan children sad when you hit them with a little turtle or you drop a banana peel
[02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:00.680]   in their face.
[02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:04.240]   Mario Kart, we were talking about how it's important for their sense of achievement to
[02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:05.240]   finally beat you.
[02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:07.480]   So what I'm doing is to be a good parent first.
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:08.480]   I have to beat them.
[02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:09.480]   Exactly.
[02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:10.480]   Exactly.
[02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:12.240]   And hey, you're a rookie.
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:14.000]   So you're going to take some Ls at first.
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.760]   You got to level up your game and be consistent, you know, two or three races a week, maybe
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:20.680]   play at night when the kids go to bed.
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:22.600]   One game only take you four minutes.
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:25.560]   Next thing I know two months later, you're going to be telling me I'm running these kids
[02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:26.560]   into the dirt.
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:27.560]   Oh, doctor.
[02:32:27.560 --> 02:32:28.760]   And that's where you get started at.
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:31.360]   And then you can move into once you get addicted because you're going to get addicted.
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.640]   That's when you move into animal crosses.
[02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:34.640]   Your mother you take care of.
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:35.640]   Lovely homie.
[02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:36.640]   Go ahead and take care of.
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:37.640]   Oh, it's funny.
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:38.640]   I was going to suggest animal crossing.
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.640]   But you didn't know.
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.640]   You didn't know.
[02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:41.640]   Didn't know.
[02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:42.640]   This is a great game.
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:43.640]   A lot of fun.
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:46.040]   And then you move an animal cross and then you'll be addicted.
[02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:49.960]   The next thing you know, you'll be playing Skyrim and laser dinosaurs will be popping
[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:51.120]   all out the windows on you.
[02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:52.120]   You'll be excited.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.880]   But start with Mario Kart.
[02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:59.480]   Yeah, I think Mario Kart is a very good suggestion, especially because it's combo.
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:01.560]   You can all play together, which is really a lot of fun.
[02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:05.240]   And you can get in quick, get in and out, play game takes five minutes.
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:06.240]   Boom.
[02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:07.240]   All right.
[02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:08.240]   You got an assignment, Lisa Schmeiser.
[02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:09.240]   All right.
[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:10.240]   All right.
[02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:11.240]   Thank you for.
[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:12.240]   Oh, portal.
[02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:13.240]   Yes.
[02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:15.120]   It just came out for the switch.
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:16.120]   Yeah.
[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:17.120]   Portal is a fun game.
[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:19.040]   I loved for when it came out.
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:22.280]   Like we used to have like little parties, but like I guess we're going to have some
[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:23.280]   same things parties.
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.280]   Like people come over, we would just play it because it was just such a fun game.
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:27.520]   It was a great game.
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:28.720]   It's a puzzle game.
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.160]   It's not violent.
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:38.160]   There is, as we mentioned, an evil robot that is kind of trying to keep you in there.
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:43.240]   You get a gun, a portal gun, which you can shoot two different kinds of holes, an entry
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:44.760]   hole and an exit hole.
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:45.920]   And it's basically a puzzle.
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:49.200]   How do you move around trying to get out?
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.200]   It's really, really, really fun.
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:52.200]   One day to point B.
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:54.200]   Guys, I only just now realized the cake is a lie.
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:55.200]   Comes from the world.
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:56.200]   That's where the cake is a lie.
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:57.200]   Yeah.
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:58.200]   Oh my gosh.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:59.200]   I was, Eddie is, or does cake or death?
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:01.600]   And I was like, oh, maybe this is just an extension of cake.
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:07.440]   You're in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center and desperately, you have a companion
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:10.080]   cube, which is a lot of fun.
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:13.760]   This is a, this is actually a cerebral game that's fun to play.
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:15.320]   It would be great on the Switch effect.
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:18.200]   Now that you mentioned it, now that it's out on the Switch, I think I'm going to get
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:22.520]   portal and portal to just came out the portal companion collection.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:24.280]   Good recommendation.
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:25.280]   Good one.
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:26.280]   I like it.
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:28.880]   Lisa is as a new job.
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:30.320]   No jitter.
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:31.320]   No jitter.
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:32.520]   No jitter.com.
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:35.760]   I am so happy for you.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:37.920]   The conference is coming up next month.
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:41.800]   Find out more at no jitter j-i-t-t-e-r.com.
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:44.640]   Do you, are you active on Twitter?
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:46.280]   You want to give your Twitter handle?
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.680]   I am active on Twitter at l-s-c-h-m-e-i-s-e-r.
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:52.680]   Great to see you.
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:54.160]   Anything else you want to plug?
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.160]   Plug something.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:58.360]   Todd, now I was going to say just be sure to check out the Enterprise Connect conference
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:00.560]   at enterpriseconnect.com.
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:04.120]   We're going to have both in person and virtual events.
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.880]   It was a pretty exciting hybrid conference tackling everything from VR and AR and the
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:16.960]   workplace to identifying issues that may hinder meeting equity and how to address them.
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:22.840]   It's a really great look at communicating at a time when it has never been more important.
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:23.840]   Awesome.
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:24.840]   No jitter.com.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:26.000]   Click the events tab.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000]   Thank you.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:35.120]   I honestly think your YouTube channel deserves to be known far and wide.
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:39.960]   When you started it, I thought, "How is she going to have time to do this?"
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:42.960]   You have found so many interesting ways to do this.
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:46.640]   I love it that you're adding cosplay.
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:47.640]   Great job on this.
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:48.640]   Thank you.
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:49.640]   The Therapist Reacts.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:50.640]   Thank you.
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:51.640]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.640]   I can't just say it.
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:55.640]   I enjoy doing it.
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:57.080]   I like making the costumes.
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:35:59.920]   I like getting dressed up and being silly.
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:01.480]   It's a great one.
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:03.560]   Sometimes I go too far.
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:04.560]   Yeah.
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:05.560]   Okay.
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:06.560]   Fine.
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:07.560]   Sometimes I go too far.
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:08.560]   But I really do enjoy it.
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:10.400]   It's really good.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:11.400]   It's really good.
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:17.960]   In the interim, you're kind of learning about yourself about psychotherapy.
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:20.880]   It's really a great idea.
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:23.360]   I do.com/georgydow.
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:25.840]   Of course, anxiety-videos.com.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:26.840]   Still doing that.
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:28.400]   Do you practice still at all?
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:29.920]   I do.
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:34.440]   I still have three days that I see all of my clients.
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:35.640]   So I do three days of that.
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:38.680]   And then the other days I do the videos.
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:40.920]   Georgia@westmountatherapy.com.
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:46.840]   If you want advice, if you're in the Montreal area, she'd be a good person to contact.
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:47.840]   Thank you, Georgia.
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:48.840]   And I do them remotely.
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:49.840]   Oh, you do.
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:50.840]   Oh, nice.
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:53.520]   Well, now most people are doing it for those enemies.
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:55.320]   I think that's how we do it, isn't it?
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:56.320]   Yeah, come and think of it.
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:57.320]   So it's no different.
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:59.160]   So I see people now all over the place.
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:00.160]   Nice.
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.520]   That's really cool.
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:10.720]   As usual, we're going to wrap things up by saying O and J.J. Stone, IQMC.com, Raising
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:12.080]   a Ninja.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:15.760]   You just interviewed Jeff Jarvis.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:18.520]   He took over the interview on that one.
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:21.720]   You took over the interview with Aunt Pruitt.
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:26.440]   So I'm going to let Owen take over Twit as we say.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.440]   Good night.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:28.440]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:30.200]   Owen, it's all you.
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:34.160]   So I do have a bobblehead one actually at a line.
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:35.160]   Oh, there you go.
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:37.760]   This is the only one I have that babbles.
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:39.560]   I found a bobble for you, Uncle Leo.
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:40.560]   Is that Wanda?
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:41.560]   Who is that?
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:42.560]   WandaVision from Wanda.
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:43.560]   Black and white Wanda.
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:44.560]   Oh, Mona from Wanda.
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:45.560]   Yes.
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.480]   That's how the show starts up.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.840]   My Twit wife, Dr. Dao, does an excellent job recapping that show.
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:54.840]   If you want to feel like you know something about mind, sense and psychology, you should
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.600]   go watch those episodes of first their fan tabulous on WandaVision.
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:02.440]   But today is a special day.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:04.360]   First of all, I never promote myself on this show.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.560]   If you watch the show, you know me.
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:06.560]   I don't care.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.120]   If you go check out what I do, whatever.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:09.120]   But Doc tells us back.
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.280]   I did interview Jeff Jarvis.
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:11.560]   I just interviewed Jason Howe.
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:13.280]   I got Lisa LePort on deck.
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:14.720]   Leo's done a show back in the day.
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:15.720]   George is on there.
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:17.280]   A lot of new people coming on.
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:19.160]   I also do a sports show every week.
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:20.160]   It is fantastic.
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:21.160]   It's called Gritty Nights.
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:22.160]   Get a drink.
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.160]   Come hang out.
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:28.200]   IQMZ Tech is now back where I rant and rave and I do a poor man's uncle Leo once a week
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:31.120]   talking about the tech news on my own show.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.360]   So IQMZ.com, all the links in the live.
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.360]   Go there and check it out.
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.280]   Now after that, let me tell you something.
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:38.240]   We are coming out of a pandemic.
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:42.960]   And they and I have been alone for two years in the world.
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:43.960]   Let me tell you something.
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:44.960]   You kind of this world.
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:48.360]   There are a lot of people that you need to not contact again.
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:49.360]   Okay.
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:52.480]   So as much as you missed family members and friends and I told you to reach out to those
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.560]   people who love those people, you've also lost a lot of losers.
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:59.040]   Don't you pick them losers back up when this world starts opening up.
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:00.840]   Some people need left behind.
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:02.480]   Do good for yourself.
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:03.480]   Leave the bag is behind.
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:06.320]   Look for better things, better opportunities, better people.
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:07.320]   No one thing.
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.760]   You cannot waste your time.
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:11.360]   You've already suffered two years of loss in time.
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:15.920]   You wasted out here with people that don't deserve or value you in your time.
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:16.920]   Be choosy.
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:17.920]   Be picky.
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:18.920]   Take care of yourself.
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:20.920]   Treat yourself out here in these streets.
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:22.360]   Not the world's opening up.
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:23.360]   Okay.
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:25.720]   Focus on you and better people around you.
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:31.480]   I'm your boy with your distone, AKA O'Dockn and as they say, another twit is in the can.
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:32.480]   Yeah.
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:33.480]   Amen brother.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:44.960]   Do the twit.
