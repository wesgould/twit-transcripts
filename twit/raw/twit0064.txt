[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.200]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 64 for July 31, 2006.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.200]   It's a chaos theory.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:38.400]   Dr. Jerry, he pornell, are you there, Jerry?
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   That's me, hello.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.000]   It's working.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.640]   It's working.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.080]   He's the sit-in curmudgeon on this show.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.840]   So let me, Jerry, let me introduce everybody you're talking to.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.560]   Some of them you may know, some of them you may not.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   Okay, he's with IT conversations, the IT conversations network.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.560]   Probably the proto-podcast.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560]   Also here Chris Perillo from Locker Nome.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.560]   Hi Jerry, did you hear me?
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560]   Hi.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   Hey everybody.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.560]   I'm 75 years old, I don't remember anybody anymore.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.560]   But Jerry, you're not confused about the internet being a tubes are you by any chance?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.760]   Well, but you know, if you call it pipe support, the guy ought to be giving a little credit
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760]   on that journey.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.800]   Oh, I think you could call it pipes, but then the question is, can the pipes get filled
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.960]   so that his email wasn't going to arrive?
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   And that's it.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.880]   Yeah, give any amount of dark fiber we got left in this country, probably not for a
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   while.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.040]   I think that's a misunderstanding on his part.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.560]   On the other hand, I do understand that the AT&T people, it's very much in their interest
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.800]   to convince him that bandwidth is a short supply, I think, and they have to have money
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.640]   to allocate lots of it type of thing.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.560]   I think that was really the issue, absolutely.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   Well sure.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.000]   You know Adam Smith, no two capitalists ever got together, but what they started a plot
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.080]   to get the government to restrict entry into the market.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.760]   The invisible hand ain't so invisible when it comes to Congress.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   But it's inevitable.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.160]   You expect it to happen, don't you?
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   Yeah you do.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.640]   Patrick Norton, are you there now?
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   I'm there.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   You have an actual picture.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.920]   I look at your thing and I see a picture.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.520]   Everybody else is just a blur, just a part of a chihuahua.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   With glasses.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.440]   How do you put the, I guess I'll fool around with it till I find out how to do it.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.040]   It's in your profile.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.440]   Okay then I'll get the picture of Mike Paladin off a world of Warcraft and put it in.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.080]   Do you play World of Warcraft, Jerry?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:57.040]   David Prager's also here, both David and Patrick were with us at Tech TV and also are now run
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.640]   their own independent IP TV operations.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.800]   David Prager does Revision 3, which is, does Ignatian and System and a bunch of, it's
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.040]   Control Alt, Chicken, a bunch of things.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.840]   Control Alt, Chicken.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   Guess what that show is about?
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.600]   What do you think it's Control Alt, Chicken's about?
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.520]   I don't have no idea.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.120]   It's a computer and it's a cooking show of course.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120]   Oh of course.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   What else?
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.280]   And then Patrick is my former co-host on the screen savers and now there's a show called
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.200]   DL TV.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.640]   And I would actually have to respond to your invitation to be on DL TV.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.120]   I would like to actually do it, Patrick, but if I can defer it a little bit until this
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.040]   podcasting book I'm working on is closer to shipping, that would be good because I'd
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   like to do it.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.240]   Is there any actual money in podcasting?
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   Yes.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   Well, we can begin.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   Let's begin.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   And we'll answer that question.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.520]   Frank Barnaco, it's actually one of our stories this week in CBS Market Watch said some podcasts,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.480]   I think he named us by name, should be making a million dollars a year.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.440]   Chris Perilos, you said yes.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   Of course.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   How?
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.880]   Anything that can be published can be monetized.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.120]   And anybody you says otherwise, yes or no?
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.440]   I got how many reports have we read from various places that are like, they're getting X number
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.360]   of hundreds of thousands of viewers per day.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   That's a good three quarter of a million dollars a month if they have a clue.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   And it's like, nobody ever talks about what comes between the traffic and the advertising
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.920]   and a lot of non-web page based.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   I don't know how to make money at these things because I don't know how to sell ads.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:33.040]   I have done not badly with public radio type subscriptions to my two websites.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.840]   We should mention that Jerry, of course for years Jerry Purnell wrote the fantastic
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.320]   Chaos Manor column in Bite Magazine.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.920]   Then Bite kind of went away as a paper magazine.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.520]   But at BiteCot.com, Chaos Manor continued for several more years.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.240]   And now you're doing your own thing.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.680]   Now they basically, we had an amicable parting of the way is they decided their budget could
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.440]   not sustain the amount they were paying me.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.160]   And I decided I didn't want to write it for them for that price.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.840]   But then I found myself in a dilemma.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:23.080]   The Japanese and Brazilians and Turks and oddly enough Riyadh still want the column.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.120]   So you've heard specifically from Riyadh and the Turks.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.960]   We want Chaos Manor.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:38.080]   The Chaos Manor column is published in Riyadh, in Arabic, in Istanbul, in Turkish.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.560]   And I'm apparently very popular in Turkey.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.840]   I say this because I meet members of the Turkish press that shows and things.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.400]   And they tell me I am.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   Well you actually know as well as those of us in podcasting what a global market this
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640]   is.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.920]   Well and of course the Japanese market is very low.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.360]   So I just want to indicate big business publications pays me as much as Peterborough used to.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.080]   Well you're answering your own question there Jerry because clearly there.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.240]   But that's not podcast.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   That's right in college.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.560]   Okay but wait a minute.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.280]   I have absolutely no problem approaching any business that wants coverage and saying hey
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.160]   would you like to sponsor our show.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   Oh that's interesting.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   Now that's interesting.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   You're not trading editorial though.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.920]   You're giving them advertising.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   Yeah of course.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.280]   You're not saying we'll give you editorial coverage.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   No.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   Some people are doing that.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.760]   Isn't that a podcast kind of business model?
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   I know you're not involved with a podcast.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   Yeah they have a mix.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.840]   I mean certainly John's doing a lot of podcasts for hire and he's mixing that in with his
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.040]   own podcast as well.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   So he's got sort of a hybrid model.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.480]   This is where scoble went.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.840]   I think the hybrid model is a problem because editorially it's very confusing.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.080]   Is this guy paying for his coverage or not?
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.880]   You know you put him on the same website and it's hard to tell what you got there.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.160]   We are very clear that the editorial is not for sale anywhere on this network.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.680]   Now we're doing the same thing with the Gigavox Media too.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   But how do you separate editorial from sales?
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   That's always been the problem.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.440]   I mean McGraw Hill went to enormous links to do that.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.000]   It was a firing offense for an ad salesman to approach editorial and suggest that we ought
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.280]   to review somebody or that we ought to take it easy on this guy, that type of thing.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.320]   That was literally a firing offense for a salesperson to do that.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.840]   I think as it should be the companies.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.040]   Same thing Patrick as if Davis of course right?
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Yes.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   They say they said Davis.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.080]   Well it may be as if now since Michael Miller became, it certainly was not the case
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.160]   that Ziff Davis some years ago.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.560]   In which having worked at Ziff Davis for on and off for a decade, what phage are you
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   referring to Jerry?
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.120]   Quite a long time ago.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.120]   Before then.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.040]   Because in the 10 years I've been involved with it, it's been a firing offense.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040]   It's a firing offense.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.920]   It's CNET and a lot of the other main problems.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.840]   Well it's an interesting issue because okay so the mainstream media you know or you hope
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.600]   you know that that's going on.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.720]   But who's watching over user created content like podcasts and blogs and how do you know
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.040]   whether to trust them or not?
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   The blog is fear.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.400]   It's a self-correcting mechanism.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.880]   That's what makes it so powerful.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   People will know.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.480]   You think people can tell?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   Well you can do it this way.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.160]   You can say yes indeed people are paying me to write about their products but they are
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:39.920]   products I use, products I endorse, products I would not endorse if I did not believe I
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.800]   can recommend them to you.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.160]   Now at that point it's a matter of how credible are you?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.320]   Well we're faced with that on Twitter.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.080]   I mean we have some advertisers, both advertisers I use.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.640]   We have two more coming both of which I use.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.000]   And we also make it very clear that now comes the ad.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.520]   And I think we also make it very clear that our coverage and I think if you listen our
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.240]   coverage is not biased toward or you know in fact in some ways it's somewhat biased against,
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.120]   I shouldn't say this but the advertiser we certainly bend over backwards not to look
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.520]   like we're in their pockets.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   Well but Leo that's a real problem.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.760]   That happens more than once in people who think they're trying to be fair.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.960]   They end up being unfair to the people who are supporting them and that's not right either.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.640]   We certainly you know AOL has been very good providing bandwidth for this podcast from day
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.240]   one and they provide a lot of bandwidth.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:41.680]   In fact I just found out a podcast to it 55 which emerged at the same time as a big ad
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.600]   campaign on Morpheus Fortuit had 700,000 downloads in about three or four weeks.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   Wow.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   For the single episode?
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.000]   Are people paying for those?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.120]   No well that's the thing AOL gives us the bandwidth.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.480]   If I were paying for the bandwidth this network wouldn't exist.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.440]   So AOL is a sponsor in kind and I have to admit if there's a negative story about AOL
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.920]   I'm disinclined to ignore it.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.560]   I certainly don't want to look like we're ignoring the negative stories but you're right Jerry
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.320]   that would be biased in the opposite direction.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.480]   How do you know do you have an ad on Morpheus Leo?
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.800]   Wasn't an ad cast universe who's one of the podcast agencies very kindly gave us a free
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.160]   bug on the new Morpheus service and I didn't know I didn't actually didn't know this I
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.680]   was just talking to Ray Slickensky today and he said hey do you notice any bump from the
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.440]   big twit ad on the Morpheus client and I said when did you do it?
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.160]   He told me and I said oh that explains it.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   I thought frankly it was a fluke it was an error in the measurements.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.920]   It was 700,000 which is twice what we normally get 700,000.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.960]   Oh yeah I was wondering what happened to ours too because we were part of that Morpheus
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   campaign.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   So you had to jump too?
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   That's it.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   There you go.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   Who was that cast?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   The Avenue you said?
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   Cast universe.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.680]   What's his name?
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.240]   Mark Jeffries.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.360]   Mark Jeffries and Ray Slickensky.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.200]   And Ray Slickensky is the guy that did iPod or a Blee.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.400]   Now all these guys are trying to, there are a number of companies, I don't want to get
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.760]   two inside podcasting here because we have other news stories but just to round this
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   out.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   I mean this was a story.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.480]   Frank Bernacco is saying this you know kind of got my ears burning.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.680]   There are a couple of agencies we use one called PodTrack that really is attempting
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.480]   to convince agencies of the value of podcasting and I think Chris Perilla you tell me if I'm
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.840]   wrong but I think they're starting to make headway.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.560]   I think agencies are starting to get it.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.680]   Yeah but ultimately I think the person in charge of the brand is going to be able to
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.600]   make the best decisions for that brand.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.040]   I agree and it's easier to go to those guys than the agency.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.080]   Well yeah I mean if someone were to come to me and of course I do a large part of the
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   production of our program I mean self-titled you know the Chris Perilla show but the
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.000]   person who produces a lot of it is the person in charge of advertising and putting all that
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   stuff together.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.720]   We've got a better grasp on our audience, on our metrics, on the kind of sponsors that
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.120]   our audience is going to react to positively and so for us we think well who would be an
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:19.440]   ideal person to you know I guess incorporate in a very NPR style model with our show and
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.800]   then we just go from there.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.360]   We do also the NPR style advertising although I just don't have the bandwidth to go out
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.640]   and talk to people so I use it.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.240]   Well I hope that Frank's wrong because tonight we're launching two new channels.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.600]   Let's hear about them both of what your advertiser is sponsored.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.160]   Gigavox launches Gigavox Media launches tonight.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   Tonight in fact as soon as we're done recording I have to get the site up and running before
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   you get the show notes.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   What is it?
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.840]   Okay so Gigavox Media is my partner Michael Gohegg and I put it together and it's a for
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.800]   profit media company based on the same technology as the conversations network and as of tonight
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   you'll see three channels there IT conversations, open source conversations and the podcast
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.760]   academy channel.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.760]   All advertising support.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   All advertising support.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.640]   We've actually had two advertisers step up even in advance before the channels are out.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.360]   Zend technologies for open source and BSW USA for the podcasting channel they're out there
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   already.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   Actually that reminds me of the Zend story.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.960]   You just see the lead developer on Zend quit in a huff this week.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   Really?
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.760]   I won't mention that right now.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.760]   That's alright.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.120]   But we're very similar to what Chris does.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.840]   I mean we have spots and intros and outros of the show.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   They're very independent of the content entirely.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.240]   Now we're lucky to do them live.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.480]   I don't like to do any issues but that's me I can do that because that's my background
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   in radio.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.280]   But we're also not doing product reviews.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   We have an agency Jerry.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   In our case we're in our case we're in house.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.240]   We have an in house staff of ad sales people.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.360]   Both you and Chris Pirlo and Doug K both are doing it in house.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.040]   But if you're in house staff consists of you and your wife when you can get her away
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.200]   from doing something else that makes a difference.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.560]   That's my staff Jerry except my wife won't help.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.520]   But you have an agent on the other hand you're employed.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.840]   I have a day job.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.920]   In fact all of us have day jobs.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.480]   Doug K you don't have a day job.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.480]   You retired on.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.720]   I have a day and night job.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.960]   You made a lot of money in the internet business and you could afford to do this.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.840]   But all of us have other incomes.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.520]   Let's put it that way.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.680]   But I think you're seeing right here.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   I'm glad you're here Jerry.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.360]   To say you know where's the beef.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.200]   I think you're seeing right here there is something happening.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.560]   It's really starting to take off.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.920]   I think in the next year you're going to see.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.160]   I think Frank Bernacco underestimated the value.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:53.640]   Well once again I can say from my own experience that with essentially no push to get subscribers.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:00.760]   I got enough to make a retirement living out of the public radio model with my old website
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.600]   before I started Chaos Manor Reviews.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   I think you're right.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.320]   I think the niche retirement income.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:13.160]   You understand not hundreds of thousands of dollars but enough that I could have paid
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.200]   the rent and lived with that in social security on that nothing else and just kept it going.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.520]   But unlike most of you guys I don't have a day job and I don't have anybody subsidizing
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   my bandwidth.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:35.440]   I have to pay Zidane for whatever bandwidth is used and that makes quite a difference
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.000]   I think.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.400]   Tell us a little more about Gigavox.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.160]   I want you to get the plug in and then we'll move on.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.760]   This is because IT conversations have been non-profit so you've decided to do a little
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.120]   profit thing.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.680]   Yeah IT conversations was not so much a non-profit as a no profit up until now.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.160]   I did it's a non-profit but it wasn't planned.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   I know a lot.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.520]   Oh it's a non-profit.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:10.440]   Well we do have the conversations network which is a real legitimate non-profit and they have
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.200]   one channel there so far called Social Innovation.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.600]   That's doing really well.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.280]   That's funded by grants so that's doing very well.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.480]   On the for-profit side though we've taken that technology like I say and we're going
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.160]   out and building a major media company and we're just launching essentially our first
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.840]   three channels tonight and then we'll be adding more for the rest of this year.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.480]   But it's an exciting project.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.640]   We do have people who are doing regular sales, traditional media sales and we're going to
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.840]   be building that up rather quickly.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:49.560]   I'm totally unfamiliar with this and if I am I suspect some of those listening to this
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.040]   are what is it you are selling when you're selling that.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.440]   That is what is your product.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.800]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.960]   It's gigavox.com which if you go there now there's nothing but six hours from now there
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   will be.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.920]   It goes well by the time anybody here.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.600]   If the gods of DNS be willing.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.400]   I think Kevin Rose can give you some help if you need any help.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.240]   He'll flip dig around pretty quick.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.080]   So we have content that's topic based.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.880]   A lot of it comes from conferences.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.760]   There are a few hosted interview shows as well and we take those conference recordings.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.680]   Video today, video in the future and we make those available for free and they are sponsor
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   supported.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.880]   So we basically are inserting audio and video spots in the intros and outros of the program
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   in order to pay for them.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.880]   What do you think you're here for?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.680]   What are the big, what are the flagship shows?
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.120]   Well, right now it's the conferences.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.120]   Conferences, okay.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:56.160]   Yeah, conferences are the big ones because if we have three years of doing this and there's
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.960]   no question that the most popular programs we've ever had are always solo conference
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   sessions.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.240]   I mean at the bottom of the barrel are panel discussions.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.600]   Panel discussions are always the lowest rated.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.320]   But the speeches, the keynotes, things like that are very popular.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.680]   Yeah, the keynote speeches that you know you would pay $3,000 in terms of registration
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.960]   and travel and you get them for free.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   No, I agree.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   Until then, you know we did.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:27.320]   What do I mean the most like you get built, you get like Bill Gates talking at WENHEC,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.120]   that type of thing and put those up.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Correct.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   Correct.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   Right.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.960]   I mean you'll remember that the most popular is still was.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.320]   In fact Chris is here.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.240]   The most popular was was at NOMDEX.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.680]   Well yeah, that's NOMDEX.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.960]   How many years ago was that Chris?
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   Two, three years ago?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   Two years ago.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   Uh huh.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.360]   That's still the most popular program and we still get you know a few thousand downloads
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   every month of that.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.960]   Chris, you do a deal with- And how do you get them?
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:59.040]   Yeah, you do a deal with IT conversations, Chris, to bring in a Doug's team to record the conferences
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   and how it works.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.560]   Well, at NOMDEX 4, yeah, certainly we did.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.720]   And it worked out very, very well for both of us obviously.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.800]   It's been- In fact, Chris is my only conference producer who hasn't renewed because he does
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.640]   such a good job of it himself.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.720]   Yeah, I mean that's a large reason why.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   That's absolutely true.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.600]   Most and most conference producers don't have the skills or have the interest in doing it.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   They just-
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   Yeah, everybody else is-
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   How do you get the wrong?
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600]   How do you get the wrong?
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   Uh, you ask.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   You ask.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   Yes.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   Can you get them too?
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.240]   And I seem to remember that you delay the release of these so that if people are going
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.000]   to sell tapes and people want the tapes they'll get them right away.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   That's where the-
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Yeah, I mean it's-
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   They're doing that revenue.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.440]   Yeah, it's a fairly complex relationship because again over three years we've learned
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.520]   what it takes to keep the conference producers happy in terms of helping them generate some
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.360]   revenues which we do through something called QuickCast.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.640]   QuickCast is essentially a fee-based service for early access to the audio.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.960]   That replaces the old cassettes and CDs on site.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   And then of course we-
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   Oh.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   All right.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   Oh.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.360]   So we spread the content out over time as well and then we're working with those producers
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.480]   also to help them feature their upcoming new events as they come back around.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   I love it.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.960]   Are you doing things like American Association for the advancement of science then?
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.160]   I would love to Jerry.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   I should talk to you.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.360]   Oh, well-
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.520]   We don't have that.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:33.400]   The Triple A S does a brisk business in those tapes but most of the professors who go to
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:40.960]   it would really rather have something other than those silly tapes as the means of getting
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.280]   recordings of the conference sessions.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.240]   I think Doug has a really good business model, frankly.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   Let's move on though.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.960]   I don't want to be too much of a podcast specific podcast.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.520]   That's the kiss of death.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.880]   Patrick Norton is working is on right now as he talks to us on a Core 2.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.920]   And how are you liking that Core 2, Patrick?
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.840]   Well, a lot which I should considering it's like a $7,000 system.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.280]   So this is a test system you have for DLTV?
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.800]   It's a test system we're filming for-
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   Whoops.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.680]   Sorry, I opened up a window and shiny happy noises started coming through.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.320]   Sorry, we got the others.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:23.080]   It's a test system we're filming for PC Magazine and we're going to use it on the show on DLTV
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   tomorrow.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.640]   Who's system is it?
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   Excuse me?
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   Who's system is it?
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   It's a Falcon Northwest system.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   I like Falcon.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   And it is-
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.160]   The phrase ridiculously fast comes to mind.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.480]   It booted up quickly because Patrick had to reboot at the beginning and boy, you're back
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.840]   on about three seconds later.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.840]   It was really quick.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.480]   And actually I rebooted up twice.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   Wow.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.720]   Yeah, you're looking at- let's see.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:52.040]   Let's go to- I mean, if you're looking at the benchmarks like high quality, doom three,
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.600]   ultra quality, it levels off, seems to be throttled by the graphics processors.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:04.200]   We're looking at like 120 frames to 114 versus a Athlon 64 FX system.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.800]   But if you get something where it's like medium quality, where it's not throttled by
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.960]   the graphics, you're looking at like 260 frames per second versus 149 frames per second.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   That's significant.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.600]   Can you see the difference when you're playing the game?
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   I can't.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.680]   I mostly look at things like Windows Media and Coder tests where the same file is taken-
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.080]   it's like in Athlon, the best of the Athlon systems taken like five minutes and 46 seconds.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   And this machine's taken about four minutes.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   It's interesting.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.820]   I'll just go back at this moment and say this was AMD's peak because Mercury Research
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:44.280]   just released a report that said AMD is at the highest ever market share in CPUs.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.200]   It's market shares now 22%.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.920]   And all of a sudden Intel comes back down to 73% and then comes back swinging with the
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   Core 2.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:59.440]   Well, they come back swinging with the Core 2, but the real question is, does anybody need
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.400]   that much computing power?
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   It depends on what you're doing.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   Yes.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.080]   Chris Perilos says yes.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   What are you going to do with it, Chris?
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.080]   Okay.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.440]   One of you needed less computing power in your entire life.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.640]   You know, I've had the same conversation.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.200]   Today, I've got plenty of computing.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   Yeah, me too.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.920]   I'm sitting here with a dual, with a dual Athlon.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:26.040]   And I am, it's doing hog piggy old outlook, which has got to be the huggiest program in
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.240]   the world.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.400]   I'm talking to you people and there are three or four other things running in background
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.640]   and it's all doing it fine.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.840]   Now I couldn't play doom while I'm doing all this on this.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   Well, there you go.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.840]   That's my point.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.840]   That's right.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.840]   Exactly.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.800]   But I wouldn't.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.040]   You wouldn't, Jerry, but I think there are those who would.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.640]   I asked Craig Barrett, this one's, and he actually got visibly irate with me and said,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.720]   "Well, that's a question old journalist often asked me.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.680]   I asked him, who needs a two gigahertz chip?"
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   And he said, "You just ask a college kid who needs a two gigahertz chip."
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.960]   I thought you could do anything you needed to do in 64K of RAM.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Well, you can't.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   Well, that's not orange.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   No, that's not orange.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   I'm orange.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   Jerry's.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   Stop.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   Stop.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.720]   The business, if you can do anything you can do in 64K of RAM or one megabyte of RAM,
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.120]   was clearly erroneous when it started.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.960]   I am just saying that I know, except for massive video editing, I know of very few people who
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.560]   have any software that can make use of this new power.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.440]   The real VISTA comes out.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:38.000]   Well, and the question becomes, AMD has bought a lot of loyalists because their stuff works
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   very well.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.680]   And for a while, Intel stumbled and gave you machines that you could make pizza in and
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.400]   they weren't very fast and they weren't very reliable.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.080]   And a lot of people went to AMD.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.160]   Now the question is, will they go back if they've got machines that are good enough?
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.440]   Well, you're still looking at, you're still looking at, I mean, it's somebody who's still
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:07.060]   using the five, you know, at home I'm still using the $500 PC I built, probably in 2003
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.020]   or 2004.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   Right?
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.540]   At work, I can't get a fast enough machine fast enough.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.080]   Yeah, but you're doing it some unusual.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   He's a good one.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.080]   He's a good one.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   He's a good one.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080]   Yeah, he's a good person.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.080]   Yeah, he's a good person.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.840]   Now I have David M, of course, can use every David M uses more bandwidth than the rest of
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.120]   us put together.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.960]   David does these enormous video files and things.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:39.320]   But down the street is my friend Will who teaches at CalArts and he has a G5 and he runs
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.720]   you know, 70 layer drawings and also does his email, talks on Skype and all that at once
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.080]   on the same machine.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.440]   He has no interest in anything faster.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.160]   Yeah, it comes time to processing.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   No, go ahead, Chris, please.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.960]   When it comes time to process video, audio, doing any type of mega tasking as AMD is calling
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.760]   it, that's when you need more processing power.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.520]   And unfortunately, when you're sitting there typing in notepad or Outlook, that's not what
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.800]   people do most of the time, Chris.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.720]   No, it's increasingly, there are more people looking into expanding and increasing their
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.320]   lifestyle on their computer.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   Audio, video.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.880]   You've been playing second life and they're listening to the music.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.440]   I mean, this is where all that processing power really comes in.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.920]   It's not for the times that you're sitting in Outlook.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.040]   It's for the times that you're trying to do something.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.640]   I think a lot of people are going to be going to the market, going by new computers when
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.040]   Vista comes out anyway.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.800]   I would have said at least two months ago when they were paying me a dollar and a half
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.400]   a word for them that I was doing something when I was writing my columns.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   Good point.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   Good point.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.120]   We do not get a dollar and a half a word for this podcast.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:27:00.520]   And I did need to high speed access the internet to check facts and get pictures and get links
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.120]   to the things I'm talking about and send out to my friends.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.600]   So what is it that you think of this?
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.040]   What is it that's driving the faster processors?
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.040]   It's gaming.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.720]   It's video compression.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.400]   It's 3D graphics.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   Maybe things like second life.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   It's not going to be Apple.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.720]   Apple is not going to AMD anyway.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.400]   No Apple will take advantage of this Core 2.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.080]   I think you're going to see Apple Core 2 boxes from Apple.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.040]   It isn't in two weeks.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.640]   And don't most people who do high end video use Apple?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   Patrick.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.680]   It's really divided.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:47.960]   I think some of the people in the industry, I live here in Hollywood but I don't pay as
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.520]   much attention to it as I might.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:56.400]   But some of the people I know in the industry here are using Windows machines because they
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.280]   had to but they just can't wait to get faster apples.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.560]   Well, they're going to get their wish I think.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.560]   I don't know.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.560]   It just seems to me most of the video freaks I know are Apple loyalists to the point that
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:21.040]   they let Apple defecate upon them from a very great height and still paid the money.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   They were so loyal that they let Apple do all the terrible things Apple did to its loyal
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.200]   base back when they were down around 2% market.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.520]   I think that was mostly Photoshop users and illustrator users at that point.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:41.160]   In any event nowadays that they're all rubbing their hands with glee over the apples are
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:50.040]   coming and I have to admit having played with a not core 2 but a core duo Apple machine
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.480]   running Windows stuff in parallel in it is pretty dong good.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.480]   Well, here's the question.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.520]   Do people stay loyal to AMD buying AMD chips even if they are plenty of speed, plenty fast
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.920]   enough for them when there's a faster chip out there for the same or less.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.480]   Don't they say I may not need it but I'm going to buy it.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   Yes.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.920]   Does it depend on the sweet spot?
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.000]   No, it's all about brand.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.480]   Actually, yeah, because I've gotten emails from people who are like I don't care how much
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.440]   faster or how much more power I can get out of the new core to compared to an AMD.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.160]   I hate Intel I'm still buying AMD.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.800]   I think there will be a loyalist will do that.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.520]   I think what you're really going to find is the competition is not going to be at the
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:39.960]   very high end anyway because I don't think there are many people who need the very latest
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.400]   and greatest.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.000]   I think the competition is going to be around the sweet spot.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.520]   What can I get for $300 for $200?
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   What can I get?
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.480]   Are you talking about chip or system prices?
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   Chip's mostly.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:01.080]   Yeah, because the chip, I mean what's interesting about the core two rollout for Intel is they've
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:07.000]   rolled out core two processors fundamentally from the $185 on up.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.560]   Yes, I know.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.960]   That I think is what AMD should really be worried about.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.360]   If Intel steals the sweet spot, then AMD's got a real problem.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.440]   Intel slashed prices by as much as half on some of its prices.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.240]   See, trying to hang on the older stuff.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.480]   Yeah, trying to hang on to the sweet spot.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   The low end stuff.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.200]   Well, the low end is pretty high nowadays, Leo.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   Oh, I agree.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   I agree.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.400]   I mean, Penny MD is, I mean, we were saying its praise is not so long ago.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   What about the AMD ATI merger?
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.040]   We talked about it as speculative last week.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.160]   It happened.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.200]   Does it change the landscaping anyway?
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.240]   I've noticed the ground's a little tilted these days as a result.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   Tilted which way?
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   Intel or AMD?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   I'm just more laughing.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:02.400]   I don't think we're going to see much impact in our lives for another couple of years.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.080]   Nvidia has already said they're going to support SLI and Intel.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.360]   Of course, we knew that because we had Kevin Crewell on last week and he said that and
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.280]   it's been an open room, open secret for some time.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.480]   But that certainly pushed them in that direction.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   Not it.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.160]   I mean, I don't know if people really care about AMD and ATI or ND.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.200]   Intel gamers do.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:29.400]   Is anybody likely to capture the high end of the video market for very long?
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.640]   Not really, no.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   In terms of graphics?
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.800]   I mean, it's been down to just AMD and or excuse me, ATI and Nvidia for a couple of
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   years now.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   It's not easy.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   There's nobody else left.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.000]   And the high end of any market is always relatively insensitive to brand because they're always
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.840]   looking for speed and quality.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   Right.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.720]   And loyalties come usually a little farther down the down the levels.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:00.440]   Did you see the the snafoo Microsoft had with its Vista speech recognition demo?
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.720]   Who saw that video on YouTube?
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.360]   I've got it posted.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.920]   Tell us about it, Chris.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   It's hilarious.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.880]   They're of course touting the fact that Windows Vista's got better voice recognition
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   technology.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.240]   So what better way of showing this than to actually demonstrate it in front of a large
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.040]   crowd of press and industry pundits?
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:24.600]   Of course, when he said, dear mom, comma, it came out dear aunt comma.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.760]   And when he tried to correct it, it wasn't going to play along.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   Dear what?
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   Dear aunt.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.240]   It somehow confused about familial relations, I guess.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.600]   Which Microsoft executive was doing the demo?
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.200]   Hard to probably one of the guys.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   Oh, man.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   Okay.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.960]   And then who did that segment was he used to be at tech TV.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.960]   He was at tech live.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   The MSNBC segment?
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.960]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.840]   Oh, and I hate saying this, but he's short.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.360]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.360]   He's in the Silicon Valley Bureau.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   Oh, this is going to kill us for not remembering his name.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.960]   Oh, he's going to kill me.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   I can see his face right now.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   Let me see.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   Here it is.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   Microsoft hosting dozens of Wall Street and Amazon.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   It's Jim Goldman.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   Here at the company.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   Oh, man.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   Of CNBC.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.280]   Good for Jim.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.720]   Credit where credit is due.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.960]   Speaking of Microsoft beta stuff, what do you think about them charging for the beta?
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.440]   A buck 50 to download the beta.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.040]   Well, they got 3 million plus downloads at the darn thing.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   And now they're like, well, we're losing money and everyone really wants to use it and try
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   it out.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.120]   So maybe it's a lot better than 25 bucks for beta two of Windows XP on CD.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   Chris Perlow.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.120]   Chris Perlow.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.880]   You're saying you of all people.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.000]   Chris Perlow is the guy who got in trouble for putting the VISTA beta up.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.600]   You got a cease and desist for Microsoft.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.880]   It was a nice ceremonial cease and desist.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.880]   That was pretty funny.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.720]   I have to say they were good sports.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.120]   And so were you when they gave you the cease and desist letter.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   Was that at Nome Decks?
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.360]   Yeah, it was at Nome Decks.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.000]   My point is, is that this technology exists.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.360]   And if Microsoft is whining about the bandwidth, they need to let it go.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   It's not bandwidth.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   You know what it really is?
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   They want to pre-qualify people.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.520]   They don't want the 12-year-olds downloading this.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.440]   They want somebody with a credit card.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.320]   I completely understand.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.040]   Even a buck 50 is enough to eliminate the kind of the riff-raff.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   Or have a get it.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.560]   The beta run for about a year, is that right?
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560]   It's a long time.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.560]   At least until next year.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.560]   Okay.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.040]   So Microsoft VISTA $1.50 for a year.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040]   It seems like a good deal.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   It's not VISTA.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   Yeah, what in the world?
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   But people are...
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   Why would you complain about $1.5?
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.080]   And if you really seriously didn't like it, you must have the email of address of at least
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.920]   one of the nice young ladies at Wagner Edstrom who will be glad to see to it that you can
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   get it free.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   Sure.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   She will put you down.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.400]   She will then put you down in her book as the worst cheapskate she ever met.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.880]   I've actually been trying to get it.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.680]   I sent out the email and everything and I haven't heard back.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   Not from WAGette.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.160]   I tried to go through the channels and I haven't heard you.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.000]   I will have to say I have wonderful relationships with WAGette.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.800]   But then I knew Pam Edstrom before she joined that firm.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   I would expect them to turn it.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.440]   She was an journalist like everybody else.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.440]   I would expect them to.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.840]   She and I and Esther and Pam Clark used to hang out at Comdexes in Las Vegas back in
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   early '70s.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.800]   So show of hand, who's used Office 2007?
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   I am.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   You.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Here.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   Okay.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   Jerry, do you like it?
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   Love word.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.440]   Took a while to get used to the new reorganization.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:43.040]   You can't find anything, but when you finally do find it, you'll find it again easily.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.240]   That's a good, actually that's a very good sign.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.280]   I don't like the ribbon, but I guess once, if you can learn it quickly, Chris Brillard,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.760]   did you find it quick to figure out and learn and use?
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.640]   Yeah, for the most part, I was only disappointed in the way that the ribbon interface worked.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:03.720]   But that being said, they've posted on their blog since the Office team has a blog, a video
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   of how they're making it so that you can hide or auto-hide the ribbon bar through a keyboard
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.000]   shortcut, and it makes it so much better.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.200]   You know, I just, I think power users use the menu to figure out what the program could
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   do.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.080]   So losing the menu is, I think, in some ways a loss.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.400]   Although, you still have a menu of some kind.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:28.960]   The menu now becomes the ribbon bar, and I think that really pushes the idea of a menu
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.400]   or a tool bar, and really, it moves it forward.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.960]   And just by the virtue of hiding that ribbon bar and not making it fully visible right
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   up front.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   Patrick, what do you think?
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.480]   For those of us who haven't seen it, Chris, what is the ribbon?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   It's okay.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.120]   It's a series of icons, all of which are like different sized, which makes it annoying
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.640]   for me.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:55.520]   It's not uniform, but the idea is that they make certain sections of the program available
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.560]   through this series of icons.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.280]   So for instance, all your editing icons would be under this ribbon, if you will, which is
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.760]   a, I don't know how.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.760]   Does it make it modal?
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.840]   Does it make it all of a sudden like you're in the editing mode or you're in the graphics
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   mode?
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   No.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.840]   Yeah, it's sort of state related.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   I don't like it.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.920]   You get a graphics ribbon if you're trying to do things with graphics.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:24.120]   You get a formatting ribbon if you're trying to do things with text and so forth.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:30.200]   I didn't like it at first, but I find one thing about it is the old menus, the trouble
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.960]   is they weren't logical.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   Right.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.160]   Things were just shoved in wherever the Chris Peters could get them fit.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   Right.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.040]   And now they've completely redone that.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.120]   So it takes a long time to find out how to do something, but once you find it out, you'll
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.400]   find it again fairly easily.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   That's what this is all about.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   And it's what Microsoft's been doing for years, which is try to hide complexity and yet still
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.080]   expose functionality so that if people need it, they can get to it.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.480]   Remember where it is Patrick?
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   We didn't get your review.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.000]   You've been playing with it yet.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.560]   Yeah, it's I don't know.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.240]   I just find, you know, it's just another artificial environment to learn if that makes
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   any sense.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   Here's the real question.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.840]   Is this just look Microsoft makes the bulk of its revenues from upgrades.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.320]   They've got to keep you buying new versions.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.080]   And lately there really hasn't been a compelling reason to buy a new version of office.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.120]   Is this redesign just to make you think you're getting something new and more powerful or
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.320]   is office 2007 actually better?
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320]   It's not is it?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.680]   It's just it's just a way of making it look like a bigger upgrade.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.120]   That's just like their stupid ad campaign with the dinosaurs.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.400]   Man, it's for Leo for whom for anybody who uses it.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.040]   I mean, do you for people who are just learning word?
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040]   Okay.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.400]   It's easier to learn this than it was to learn the old.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.320]   Sure, but they're buying a new copy anyway.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.440]   I'm talking about people who have been buying, you know, they have office XP, office 2000,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440]   office 2000.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   I wouldn't bother.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.720]   It's just another version three.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   I wouldn't bother.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.040]   Yeah, I wouldn't buy.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:09.960]   I wouldn't buy the new office unless I were writing about it or something.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.800]   Or if it were a buck 50.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   That sounds good to me.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   That sounds like a good deal.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.120]   On the other hand, if you buy it for a buck 15, get used to it.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.760]   You'll never be able to figure out how to use the old word.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.320]   Maybe that's that's the plan.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   Get them hooked now.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.640]   So they can E3 kind of a gone went back and forth on this story initially next gen, which
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.920]   is a British gaming magazine announced that E3 is dead.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.160]   I think they were just trying to grab headlines, but it does look like E3 is going to have
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.120]   to refocus a little bit.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.160]   What's going on with E3?
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.600]   Well, I think it's the same thing that happened with a index in the same.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.920]   But how could this show be dying?
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:56.440]   I mean, E3, I mean, this year's E3 was a Gala event, huge, glitzy, lots of money being
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.200]   spent on booths.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.040]   You wouldn't look at it and say all of a sudden, oh, this is a conference in trouble.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.440]   Why are they worried?
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.080]   Why are they downsizing?
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.240]   Chris, you had some thoughts.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.520]   Well, I think the industry is moving towards smaller.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.120]   Smaller is better in terms of conferences.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.360]   I think E3 is getting a little too big, just like Condeck's got a little too big.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.520]   And instead of facing an explosion, I think they're imploding.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.120]   And I think they're going to be smaller conferences that are going to happen.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.160]   They're going to be a lot more targeted to various audiences.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.120]   That's what you agree, Patrick?
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.760]   Well, I talked to some of the gaming group people.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:42.000]   And the general consensus is EA alone spent $10 million on their surround sound, you
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.560]   know, video, studio, booth, arena, whatever you want to call it.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.600]   And some people are putting their expenditures at E3 close to like, you know, $20 million,
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.840]   $30 million overall, you know, which is in line for what I've heard being spent.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:01.760]   I remember, you know, 10 years ago, or how long ago was it when Sony launched at BCXBO?
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.200]   I don't remember the exact day.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.920]   I mean, years and years ago, they spent like $11 million for that, you know, one small
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.720]   spot at the Javits at the Trade Ship.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.520]   And it's what's generally the general consensus is that you've got too many kids who, you
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.000]   know, aren't really, are great because they're members of the community and they're valuable,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.360]   but aren't really that good in terms of generating either the leads you need or the press coverage
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   you need.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   It's hard to, you know, like Chris is saying, it was like, when Comdex got up to the size
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.240]   of CES, it was getting impossible to, you know, to make meetings as impossible.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.280]   Is it over for CES?
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.240]   No, I don't think so.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:44.440]   The CES is a little different because CES is still about CES is not so much about the
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.480]   insiders as it is about the entire industry.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.200]   So everybody from, you know, every single, you know, you've got, when you've got somebody
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.880]   from a car stereo shop and Dubuque can walk into, you know, they can see their monster
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.080]   cable dealer, they can go check out the new products.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:05.640]   So because the consumer electronics business is more diverse and there are many more retailers,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:11.120]   they need a trade show, but the narrow focused gaming business doesn't.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.280]   Well, I think it's also because E3, it's just, you know, you know, Christmas and before,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.880]   it's gotten, it's gotten big, it's gotten crowded, it's become enormously expensive
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.840]   to make any kind of a footprint there.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.080]   And it's becoming the thing is, is people want to tie in, people want to tie in proof
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.840]   that they're getting value for the money they're spending at a trade show.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.600]   I imagine what happened was that Sony, Nintendo, EA, a few of the big players, Microsoft,
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.160]   said, no, we're not going to pay those prices or we're going to do something else.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.480]   If you had those four pull out, you wouldn't have much of a show.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.680]   If you had one of them pull out, you wouldn't have much of a show.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.360]   So it could have very well been just one.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.520]   And my guess is if it was the one, it probably was Microsoft.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.240]   They're not going to be in the LA Convention Center anymore, but they will stay in Los Angeles.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   They're not shutting down.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.480]   They want everybody to know.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.560]   You know, we tried to get Gina Smith on the show because it was actually Gina who started
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.800]   the show, E3 show.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.520]   Remember, she had a magazine called Electronic Entertainment, E2, and they started the E3
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.520]   show about 12 years ago.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.320]   But she's a little busy, but she's going to be on a future show.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.720]   She was kind of perturbed that her baby was in trouble.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.440]   Do you go to E3, Jerry?
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:28.680]   I have gone to every E3 and even before that, to Seabull's digital electronics conferences,
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.160]   which really was kind of the beginning of what became E3.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.120]   Are they useful for you as a journalist?
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:39.240]   Yeah, but I didn't go to this one because this year they decided there were too many
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.760]   people getting free tickets and they made us jump through hoops like you wouldn't believe.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   They wanted me to give them tear sheets and copies of this and all kinds of stuff.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   And I said, screw it.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.600]   I went to the PEPCON event, you know, and some of the private parties.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   But in the first place, describing the E3 floor is a little like describing a scene from my
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.440]   novel Inferno anyway.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.600]   It's loud and you know.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.840]   Which ring of hell is it?
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.960]   Exactly.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:20.760]   And but for them to, and what they don't understand is the kids who are trying to wangle free
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.040]   tickets will jump through all those books.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   They'll do it.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   You better.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.280]   And I really don't believe that Microsoft and EA were paying great deal of money to be protected
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   from me.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.200]   They didn't get any ink from me because I didn't get to see their stuff.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   Right.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.080]   Not I turned out I'll talk to a lot of other people of kind of my, not maybe my age because
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.760]   I'm older than everybody else.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.600]   But people who've been in, you know, reporting in the industry a long time and who have some
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.400]   reputation and a bit of a name and most of them won't go either.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.760]   They just didn't want to go through this year.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.680]   Hell that the convention staff was trying to put people through to get residential.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.960]   E3 is a little different than CES, isn't it?
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.840]   Because it's more aimed at the press than it is aimed at dealers.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:13.200]   Which you would think if they would make them want to get press people there.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   Thank you.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:21.120]   But in fact, they made a great number of the non-gaming press people very angry with
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.000]   them because, well, we never heard of you.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.080]   You don't write for computer gaming world.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.280]   Well, no, I don't.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   I don't.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   I don't do that.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   No.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.600]   I understand they made Mossberg unhappy and everything.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   That's not good.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.360]   So, it's not good at all.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:44.560]   You know, so once they get in that mode of we're doling out the sacred gold and we
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.720]   would rather sell tickets at the door than let somebody in free who might actually have
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:56.680]   some readers, I think that's one reason that didn't get much ink this year.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.760]   And that's one reason why a lot of the big players said, "Wait a minute.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.600]   We spent all this money and the only people who wrote about us were the game magazines."
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.600]   12 year olds.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   Well, yes.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   They were the only press people allowed under the place.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.160]   Yeah, it's really too bad because I'm sure, I mean, I can see a little bit that they're
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:17.240]   worried about, you know, everyone and their dog can say, "I've got a blog and I'm now a
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   journalist."
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   It's hard now to credential people.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   Sure, I understand.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.000]   But when I went there for God's sakes, I'm there for CMP and Bite Magazine, which has
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.560]   been around long and everybody else can cry.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.560]   God, you know.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.640]   I mean, it's no longer about how long you've been around, but what your reach is and what
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.240]   your actual audience reach is.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.440]   Well, I have a hell of an audience reach.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:43.320]   And a lot of the kids I saw wandering around at PEPCOM with press crashes probably have
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.040]   130 readers, including all the relatives and classmates.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.520]   Well, I'd be very careful with that, General.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.600]   It might be the influencers too, right?
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   Chris?
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:01.280]   And if your audience is still, well, let's say if they're fine running their 386 at home
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:07.800]   because that's as much computing power as they need to complete email on Juneau, you
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.320]   know, it's not the audience that they're going for, I think.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.560]   I think it's also a different word.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:19.240]   I would have to say that Vites readership is probably fairly sophisticated power users
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   and so forth.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.880]   It is a different word by a lot of me.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:29.320]   My readers are people who basically like doctors who like to be their own MIS and...
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   And I bet they buy a few games, I have to say.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.040]   They play a lot of games.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:42.520]   I think you will find that a great number of business users, particularly small home
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.280]   office people buy a powerful machine so they can play Warcraft.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:53.640]   And in fact, I know of hundreds of my readers who meet me in Warcraft games.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.920]   So I'm pretty, you know, so they may be old Fogies, but they're fairly rich old Fogies
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.040]   with a fair sophistication.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.360]   Jerry, what's your character in the world of Warcraft?
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:09.000]   I ain't going to tell you that on the air, that's for sure.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.880]   I'm the tech guy in Lothar.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.400]   I'm an undead priest.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.880]   Come take me on.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.280]   Actually, what I hope people will do is give me stuff.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.120]   You see, if people recognize you, Jerry, they don't try to battle you.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.760]   They give you things.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.320]   Here have a cloak of the demon of doom.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.160]   Real quickly because we've got to run here, because I could go on for a long time.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.600]   This is a lot of fun, but there are a few big MySpace stories.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   I thought I'd bring up.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.680]   First of all, MySpace was down.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.480]   They claimed due to a power outage over the weekend, last weekend.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.160]   They say a power outage in Los Angeles area.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.960]   I've seen other blogs say, "No, it's not a power outage."
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   They were DDoSed and a number of other sites were down as well.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.240]   Six hours from MySpace out of commission.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.880]   Well, the whole internet was down then.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.240]   I couldn't talk to any of my friends.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.400]   There's no internet by the MySpace.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.640]   We're ignoring Devorak.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   We've got Jerry.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.640]   We don't need Devorak.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   The problem is I can't--
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.640]   Right.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   That's right.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   Jerry is a--
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   It's hard to devorak.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   Did you really?
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.920]   Maggie Cannon was the editor of InfoWorld.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:23.720]   We back when, and I was one of the senior writers of freelance with InfoWorld, but Maggie
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:30.200]   and I talked a lot, and his chemical engineer applied for a position as a reporter columnist.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.560]   Oh, I might have to bring Devorak in just to give him a little hard time.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   Let's tell you what.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.800]   We'll make this be the old guys podcast.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.680]   David, are you the youngest on here right now?
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.840]   If there's anyone else in their 20s, then I--
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.840]   I think yes.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.840]   How old are you, Chris?
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.840]   13.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.840]   Not in spirit.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.840]   But Chris is younger than I am.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.080]   Chris, are you that young?
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.880]   Yeah, I just turned 13.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.800]   No, actually I just turned 33.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   See?
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   He's an old guy.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   I'll tell you what.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   We'll get Devorak in a little bit.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   I want to do this Myspace.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   We need the young people for Myspace.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   I want to put Myspace.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.240]   Are you talking about the Billy Bragg thing?
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   Yes, Billy Bragg.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   Well, I'll see you.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   Here's what happened.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   Myspace changed their--
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   I have a 13-year-old girl.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.320]   She's the neighbor girl down the street.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.080]   Joanna, you are a 13-year-old girl on Myspace.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:22.760]   I have a 13-year-old girl character on Myspace, and it is amazing the male idea.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.320]   You're the one people are worried about.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   Oh, God.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.560]   I'm not me.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.560]   I never make anything proper.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.560]   I'm sure you don't.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.920]   I'm just very naive and golly.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.920]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   Really?
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   Is it that long?
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   I could see the headlines now.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.440]   Jerry Purnell, 13-year-old girl on Myspace.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.200]   Well, I'm dead sure there are a lot of them.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.240]   No, of course that's the whole point.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.520]   No, the issue with Myspace is they changed their terms and conditions.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:57.160]   And in a very, I think, critical phrase, they said that they would have a non-exclusive
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.880]   but fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide license to anything you put on Myspace.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:07.320]   And that's where Billy Bragg, who's a rock star, said, "Whoa, I'm not giving them rights
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.560]   to any of my music and pulled off of Myspace."
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.440]   You know, I think this is just the beginning.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:18.400]   Seriously, I mean, a lot of people are putting their entire lives on Friendster, Facebook,
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   Myspace.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.600]   It goes far as Flickr, YouTube.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.280]   They're putting their entire identity into these third-party services.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.320]   And what happens is that their whole livelihood just flutters away.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.200]   Well, I don't think Myspace really wants Jerry Purnell's 13-year-old girl and her output,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.640]   but they certainly want Billy Bragg's, right?
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:44.520]   Well, I mean, I'm an ability Bragg fan forever and I understand why he's upset.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:49.720]   But it's like, I'm more upset by YouTube's, you know, YouTube's recent announcement that
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.160]   they own the rights to republish or resell anything on YouTube.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.200]   And that if you want it, if they decide, you know, the only way to pull their right to
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.840]   sell your stuff that you post on YouTube is by pulling it off of YouTube.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.680]   So they can sell it, you can be upset and you can pull it, but they've already sold
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.360]   it, even the, you know what I mean?
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.720]   The whole, if you post, we own it kind of thing is a little sketchy.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.960]   I mean, not just for, I mean, you know, I mean, Billy Bragg, you know, who knows?
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.640]   Maybe Billy Bragg will finally have that insane hit that pushes him into the, you know, top
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.520]   of the charts worldwide, but, but I can see him as a musician totally being like, no,
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.880]   you don't own rights to my stuff.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   You can't resell it.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   Yeah, I completely understand.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.880]   I'm supposed to.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.160]   I think they do that just, I think they're doing it just as some sort of legal maneuvering
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.560]   to make life easier for themselves.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.480]   We talked about, yeah, we talked about this last week with YouTube.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.040]   I mean, I think a lot of sites do this.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.200]   It's just a natural thing to do.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.080]   And then of course, every time they do, the people go, whoa.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:48.680]   But of course, one of the main things that the, my space is famous for aside from all
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.880]   the 13 year old girls is the fact that it's a place where we're, we're, we're, indie
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:55.520]   artists can do stuff and like indie artists are excited about getting their stuff distributed,
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.760]   but they also care about, you know, giving themselves away.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.360]   And I, at the same time, you know, I'll agree with Chris and that, and that the fact that,
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.920]   you know, you should be posting on your, all your crap on a bunch of these websites like
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.360]   Facebook and MySpace and Friendster.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.080]   So I mean, like ideally, you know, if you're a musician, you'd find you'd make your own
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.080]   website.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.880]   I don't want to see Jerry's 13 year old girl.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.280]   He used a picture of a girl down the street.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   Is that how you did it?
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.680]   Oh, we've lost him again.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   This is a neighbor girl and her.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   You have lost me?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.680]   No, you're there.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.680]   You're not here.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   No, you are.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   You know, you're cutting in and out.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.600]   And I think that maybe you have, this is one thing you have to watch out for with Skype.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.880]   You might have something going on, some network process going on in the background.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.480]   Yeah, I could well be.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.760]   Yeah, that'll kill the faster processor.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.480]   No, more bandwidth.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   More bandwidth.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   We need more bandwidth.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   What's happening?
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.280]   Faster processor wouldn't hurt though.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.680]   I'll do a lot to the app lot too.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.080]   See, he needs a core too.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.680]   You see, you're proving it.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.680]   We've got bandwidth.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.680]   I'm watching.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.760]   Jerry, yeah, you're cutting in and out right now.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.680]   So I'm not sure exactly what it is.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.680]   Yeah, I don't know what it is because maybe it's your mic.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.680]   Check, make sure that connection is your mic.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.880]   Yeah, it could be the microphone.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   It sounds okay now.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.880]   It sounds okay now.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.480]   Okay, well as long as it sounds all right now.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:27.680]   Well, I remember neighbors permission to use their girls picture.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   You didn't use your name.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   Of course not.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   It's a made up name.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.080]   And I just wanted to see what would happen.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.280]   Any sort of interest?
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.280]   Now I'm curious.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   Anybody else have a fake profile in my space?
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.280]   No.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.280]   That you'd admit to?
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.080]   To define fake.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   Uh huh.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.880]   Okay, well are you Patrick?
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.120]   Are you a 12 year old boy?
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   I don't know.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.120]   What are you on my space?
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   No, Patrick.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   You're not Patrick.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.960]   I'm Leo Laport on my space.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.120]   I don't ever use it.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.360]   Let me ask you something.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.080]   I asked my daughter when she was on my space.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.920]   I said, what are you doing?
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   Are you okay?
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   She said, don't worry, Dad.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.720]   I'm a 23 year old guy in New Jersey with the drives of Camaro.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   I'm fine.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.200]   Okay, okay.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.160]   You flip pizzas with the guy.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.160]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.400]   I'm curious about it.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.680]   The music business I don't know much about.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:30.680]   But I would think that if you're brand new and trying to get exposure, you're going to
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   have to give some things away.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.680]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.720]   You had to give them to the record companies anyway.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.720]   Right.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.960]   And indie artists, what did they mind?
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.080]   You know, it's a non-exclusive license.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.560]   It's not like Myspace owns your stuff.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:49.000]   So you get to go perform it, which means you're better off than, I mean, you're no
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.640]   worse off than you would have if you'd gotten to Motown Records 10 years ago, who took everything
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   anyway.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.640]   Right.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.840]   I think it's the Billy Braggs of the world who are more scared.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.920]   I mean, if you're established artists, you have more to lose, right?
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.400]   I mean, artists have a hate relationship with their publishers.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.560]   It may have changed recently, but I don't think so, that authors do not have with our
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   publishers.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:16.440]   I mean, publishers may be the class enemy, but we don't hate them.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   They don't try to take everything.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.440]   But you will notice-
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   It's been in the publisher cheering.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.440]   Wow.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.440]   You should talk to my father.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.920]   I don't know which one you have.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.560]   I think that's what's changing, though, and that's why I think consumer-created content
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   is so exciting.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   I mean, here we are.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:34.600]   We're doing our own thing and we're keeping it ourselves, which I think is great.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   But at one time, I know plenty of artists who actually like sent things to my website,
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:48.720]   letters to me saying, "Encourage your readers to rip anything off that they ever see of mine."
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.720]   I think that's hard.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.600]   I will never get any of the money anyway.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.600]   Oh, I see, yeah.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.800]   The record company is going to take all of the money.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.440]   And do you know how they got that in their contract?
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:05.240]   The default in the copyright law that makes performance art by default be owned by the
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.280]   publisher and not by the artist?
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   No.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:14.920]   Well, that was a staffer in the Congress in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.640]   There was a staffer who wrote in a bunch of defaults in the contract in the absence of
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:27.200]   explicit differences in contract, then the publisher basically gets it all.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   It's in the DMCA.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:33.520]   Yeah, and he put it in the night after the second reading and before the Congress voted
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.000]   on the bill.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   The result of it is I have yet to find a Congressman who admits that he voted for that or knew
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   that he voted for it.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.760]   Well, many of them said that he didn't have time to read it.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:52.920]   And of course they don't, but the point is no Congressman knew they were doing that.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.600]   Several have tried to get it out, but they can't because a lot of you have, meanwhile,
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:01.160]   that staffer is now the Vice President for Public Relations of RIAA.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.640]   Oh, you got his.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:11.000]   Now, does that tell you what, you know, but so, but in publishing the science fiction
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.440]   writers of America and the authors guild and some others actually went to the congressional
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:21.960]   hearings and we got some inputs into the act which at least protected some of our stuff.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   I remember that.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.960]   I remember that.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.520]   And I remember that back and spoke for the fiction writers and so forth.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.880]   And that so published authors don't have that problem.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.400]   But on the other hand, if Corey Doctor is right, it don't matter because copyright shouldn't
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.240]   exist anywhere, everything ought to be free.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.640]   Let's not get into that battle until we get Corey on here.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.160]   Maybe you and Corey, we'd be a fun podcast, get you and Corey on debate.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.440]   We don't agree on it.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.640]   I know you don't.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.040]   But the authors back at work because they've just passed, at least the house has passed,
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:03.760]   the DOPA Act, there's a good name for a bill, deleting online, Presitor's Act.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:09.560]   And one of the things that in fact does is it bans my space from schools and public libraries.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.680]   In fact, it basically says kids can't chat.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:19.040]   You know, I think what they need to ban is old guys pretending to be 13 year old girls.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:23.360]   But that like trying to keep the kids from chatting is unenforceable.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.000]   I mean, it'll force them maybe on the texting on telephone.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.760]   That's exactly the point.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.880]   There's no way this is going to work.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:37.040]   And I would think where I an independent record artist that I would hate that because
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:43.440]   as I say, the things like my space is their means of getting exposure.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.960]   You have to be prepared to give something away.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:51.160]   Every one of us who makes a living in the writing business had pretty lousy contracts
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.160]   the first time.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.720]   Then usually it had an option clause to let them out.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.960]   The next book had a pretty lousy rate.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.920]   But if you were smart, you got an agent in there somewhere.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.960]   And after that, you didn't have to sign that garbage anymore.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.120]   We're well over the hour, Mark.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.120]   So I tell you what I want.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.720]   I do want to bring in John C. Devore.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.800]   I just briefly said, David, can I let you go?
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   Yep.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   I appreciate your being here.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.320]   David Prager, of course, with revision three.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:20.160]   I ask you every time anything you want to tell us going on in revision three, anything
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   new.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.920]   I will be back in about maybe two weeks and I'll tell you a whole pile of stuff.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   Okay.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   So two weeks out.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   No, I'm not saying two weeks out.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.360]   I'll just I'll have more to say.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.360]   You have more to say.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.640]   I know I keep saying it.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.840]   It's hard to give NC promises and I don't want to do an end promise.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.080]   No, I think that's great.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.800]   I just give you the opportunity every time.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.760]   But of course, you always can go there to see the Ignatian and control all chicken
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.960]   and more to come.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.560]   I know I think I have a little inkling of one of the things you're going to announce.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.560]   I was really.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.760]   Yes, I know a little bit about that from another party.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.760]   Nice.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   And I'm very excited about it.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.360]   I think it's great and I can't wait until we can tell people about it.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   Awesome.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   All right.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360]   Thanks, David.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   All right.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   Thanks.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360]   Take care.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.960]   And we are going to add if we can get John up here, John C. Devore.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.560]   Act because Jerry hired him.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560]   Hello, John.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.560]   Let me these Ritz ringing.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.600]   I'm going to answer, I think, because they probably went down and make dinner.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.600]   He called us earlier.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   In fact, we may not even be able to get him.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.040]   You see, John actually does have a picture.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.040]   There he goes.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.480]   John C. Devore, are you there?
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.320]   Hey, John, Jerry, how you doing?
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   Hi, John.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   How you doing?
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.040]   Jerry was just telling us how he got you your job.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.840]   I didn't either, but it was Maggie.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   Maggie did.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   I was working with Maggie.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.240]   The point is I was with the info world before he was.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.840]   You were with info world before anybody was, Jerry.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.160]   Well, I was certainly there when Maggie hired John.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:49.400]   Well, that's not the way I remember it, but...
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   Okay.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.240]   So I will have to admit that if you have a sharper memory of it, John, you may.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.840]   I just remember when...
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.280]   I wasn't a staffer at info world, of course.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.000]   I was just writing pieces for him periodically.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.760]   You know, you were making so much money writing it by...
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.640]   I don't believe for a minute you would stoop to even write for this.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.600]   A little bitty weekly at the time.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.280]   It was only 20,000 CERC.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280]   But I did.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280]   I know you did later.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   You did later.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.120]   Well, but I did when Maggie was there too.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.120]   I just didn't write much.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   No.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.280]   But I had the first three years with bite.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.800]   I had a non-exclusive...
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.520]   They didn't have an exclusive write to anything about it.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.520]   Well, I do...
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520]   Yes, they offered me.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:37.440]   Then PC and Waggazine offered me a good bit to alternate with Peter Norton in a column.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.960]   And bite said, "We can't stand that."
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.280]   And I said, "You know, they are for him to pay me more."
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.600]   And bite said, "We'll fix that."
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.760]   So after that, it was in pretty good shape.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   Was there really that much going on in the Mesozoic era?
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.760]   It really was.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.760]   You know, I always thought...
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.200]   On the early days, that was real money for journalists in those days.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.840]   I thought Peter Norton was...
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.120]   I thought he was imaginary.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   I didn't know.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.200]   Actually, no, we're just kidding.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.360]   That was real money.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.480]   So, no, Jerry did get me out of info world, though I have to say.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.280]   So that's more valuable than getting me into info world, I have to say.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.080]   How did he get you out?
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.560]   That's a long story that we'll save for our drinks.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.720]   Dude, there's too many characters involved in that story by the fact that Matt always...
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.200]   And too many of them are still a lot.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.360]   He found out something that I needed to know and it was just a long story for that.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.160]   Well, John, you already missed it, Twit.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.840]   We already did Twit.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.160]   But I just wanted to bring you in to bring the average age of this podcast now, finally
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.000]   closer to my own.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   And I think...
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.720]   We jack it way up.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.120]   We jack it way up.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.420]   There's nobody under 30 in this podcast now.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:50.760]   Just to introduce everybody around, because you don't see Doug Keh, he's over on ISDN.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   He's kind of in the back of the room.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760]   Hello, John.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.080]   Hey, Doug.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.440]   And Jerry Purnell, of course, Chris Perrillo is here, who you've worked on a book together
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.400]   with, I know, and Patrick Norton.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400]   So the whole gang is here.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.720]   I just wanted to bring you on and say hi, John.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.120]   Yeah, it looks like you got a big crew.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   You're done.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.800]   Yeah, well, you had a big crew then.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.080]   We had a big conference call and the thing went till six o'clock and then, you know,
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.960]   so I said, aren't you going to do Twit?
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.240]   I said, no, I looked at the clock.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.640]   It was, oh, yeah, I guess.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   I would have been screwed anyway, because we can't get more than five in here, so it
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   worked out fine.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   That's fine.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.480]   Glad we could talk to you.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.480]   Anything good?
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.800]   Well, we talked about that E3 thing.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.440]   I mean, did you have any thoughts about that?
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.040]   We actually, I think we kind of covered it pretty well, which is just that it's inefficient.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.240]   And Jerry was complaining he couldn't even, they made him jump through hoops to get in.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.360]   You didn't go, you didn't even try to go, I imagine.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.600]   I actually had the, if you contacted the right people in advance, it'd be easy to get in.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.800]   I mean, they were going to let me in and let my JC in when he was like only 16.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.760]   So I mean, that was violating their rules, but it was just a matter of contacting them
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.160]   or I have people.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.280]   The thing that my son mentioned, which I don't know if he brought up or not, but it looks
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:11.080]   like it's kind of an interesting idea, which is that with E3 fading, the possibility that
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:16.400]   the game developers conference here in San Francisco could become the big, big show.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.720]   It certainly is for the game developers and it always has been.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.080]   It's a great show, but you mean a show from the point of view of covering gaming.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.560]   Yeah, I mean, this could be like a, you know, the attorney, the show has been getting bigger
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   every year.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.080]   And now with that show missing a beat, it's possible that this show could become huge.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.840]   So it's not over for trade shows.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.960]   No, this is, you know, these guys, they overpriced, they priced things wrong.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.200]   I think there's a lot of.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.160]   You know the show I miss with Seabold's old digital conference.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.720]   They used to hold down in Beverly Hilton.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.240]   And it was the conference was the important part.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.840]   They actually had conferences with people talking about this stuff.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.120]   Yeah, you know what the problem is with those conferences today as far as I'm concerned
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.200]   is that in the old days, the most of those speakers got paid.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:06.560]   When you have a conference and everybody's speaking for free for quote unquote promotion,
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.960]   and that's what CES does by the way, that's why they have, they have never had a good
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.280]   conference at CES.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.000]   It's always just crap.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.600]   Is because they won't pay anything.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.680]   I mean, CES is so cheap.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.920]   I mean, even Comdex would give people a hotel room or a limo or they do something.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.360]   CES won't give you anything.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.640]   Comdex would at least give us something.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.840]   Of course, we gave their awards away from him.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:35.960]   Do you remember that panel you and I headed the operation system shootout back at Comdex?
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.880]   Was that in the DOS days?
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.240]   No, no, in the 40s.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:49.680]   Now, this was when OS2 and Windows and Sun and some of the others were actually all
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.440]   viable.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.040]   And John and I were kind of the judges on a presentation of a bunch of fun.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.840]   A bunch of these guys coming up presenting why their operating system was going to win.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   I like that.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.320]   Who was the winner, Jerry?
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.040]   Who was the winner?
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.240]   I think John and I both agreed that OS2 was the right one, but we also agreed that Windows
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.940]   would win.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.120]   And you were right on both counts.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.680]   Was either that or I think small talk.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.840]   Maybe that's a shot.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:25.400]   I remember there used to be a guy that was the one of the top.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.640]   And then, you know, he was one of the top researchers in the same group of Gartner and
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   all these other guys.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.280]   And he spent a year promoting small talk as the next big thing that will take over.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.680]   And he pushed himself out of a job and never seen anything quite like it.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.840]   Yeah, but you know small talk is still highly influential.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.880]   It may not have made it in terms of market share, but a lot of influence even on Apple
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880]   on Macintosh today.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   Yeah, I know.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   I don't think there's any doubt about that.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.920]   They got it got the whole notion of object oriented message.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   Message oriented.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   It was just unusable.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:05.920]   Yeah, yeah, as small talk as such wasn't too useful, but the concept of object oriented
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.560]   stuff was it sure was a revolution.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.600]   I'm going to wrap this thing up.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.840]   But let me let me go through the panel and give everybody a plug.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.440]   First of all, John, you haven't said it yet.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.000]   I want to give you a chance.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Devorak.org/blog.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.080]   Is that what you're referring to?
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.320]   People should rush there right now.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.320]   Possibly.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.560]   That could be what I was thinking.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   Yes.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.560]   Have a great night, John.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560]   See ya.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   Take care.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560]   He's got to go off and make flank steak.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.240]   Jerry, you want to tell us where we can find you now?
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.680]   It's not at bite.com anymore.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.520]   No, no longer bite.com.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:42.720]   You can find me at JerryFurnell.com, all one word, or at ChaosMatterReviews, alloneword.com.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.520]   So this is your new venture.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.760]   ChaosMatterReviews is the column I wrote for bite from 1970 until last month.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.280]   And much beloved, I must say.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.040]   And it's still the same column.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.080]   You can come read it.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.440]   And if you like it, subscribe.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   Awesome.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   We'll do.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.920]   ChaosMatterReviews will put a link in the show notes so everybody can find it.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.800]   It's been an honor to have you on.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.880]   It's been great talking to you.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.120]   Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   Thank you.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   I appreciate it.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.600]   Dr. Jerry Purnell, who I should hasten this say, is also a great science fiction writer.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.080]   I think people forget that that's really what he is.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080]   What he does.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.960]   He's one of the great science fiction writers.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.360]   Chris, how are things going at the locker gnome?
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.160]   You've got the Chris Pirlo podcast, Chris Pirlo's show.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.320]   GnomeDex was a huge success this year.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   I imagine.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   Where are you going to have it next year?
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.600]   Most likely, LA, because we found that a lot of the people at this year's conference
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.400]   were really into media.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.080]   And so we want to try to bridge that gap between traditional media and new media.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.280]   And we figured there's no better way of doing that than in LA.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.680]   Can we come this time?
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.280]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.880]   I caught the podcast he did.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   You didn't invite us.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   No, that's not.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.440]   Okay, so yes, yes.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.520]   And hopefully in a couple of weeks we'll be able to talk about this new video project.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.960]   I'm really excited about this.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:07.280]   This kind of started in a, there's a back channel mailing list that actually Chris hosts
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.400]   very graciously for tech TV alumni.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.200]   And it just kind of floated, started floating around in this that maybe we should have a
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.840]   reunion of some kind.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.480]   It wasn't clear at first whether it was going to be a party or a TV show.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.520]   I think, but well, the party is going to happen first.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   I know that much.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.960]   Chris Cosech says, I plan my, whatever, whatever it was, high school reunion, Caudrion.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   I think I can do that.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.800]   So she's back in DC with Alex.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.000]   Alex Wellen, of course.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.440]   And so I guess she's going to do the planning.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.120]   And I think when we do the party, it'll be, we'll do some sort of show with it too.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.480]   But then Chris had a great idea.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.920]   Chris Perrillo had a great idea.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.280]   You want to kind of, should we hold on to it or should we tell them a little bit about
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   what you're thinking?
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.760]   Alex Well, I think all the listeners probably already know.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.560]   Chris I think we've kind of, you put it out there in a blog posting, which was heavily
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560]   dug.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560]   Alex Oh, wow.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:56.400]   Chris A site basically for all the old tech TV alum to kind of post their thing.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.560]   Alex Yep, to upload new content, existing content.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.800]   I mean, just make it easier for the talent.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.400]   Chris A centralized, centralized place where we go, I'll let everybody know what we're
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   doing.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.760]   And in a way, that would be the beginning of the reunion, I think.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.880]   Alex It'd be a nice way.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.680]   And I think give us a way to kind of connect with the tech TV community that we weren't
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   able to before.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680]   Alex And it's really there.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.280]   I mean, it's bigger than ever.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:27.240]   Alex Oh, I'm still blown away with how many people dig that story.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   Alex Yeah.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   Alex Just blown away.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.760]   Alex Well, you know, at this point, there's no way we could bring back any of the shows
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.000]   because in nostalgia, in distant memory, they seem so much better than they actually
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   were.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.280]   Alex That's for sure.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.720]   Alex So we can't recreate them because they're
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   better.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.600]   There's no way we could come close to the way you people are imagining it.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.320]   But we do all have other things that we're doing.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.080]   That's what's really exciting in the good news.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.640]   And I do think a reunion show.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.160]   I think it's not for a while.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.240]   I mean, if we're going to do a show, it's going to be probably not until next year.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.240]   Alex No, I can't imagine.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.640]   Alex Takes a while to plan all this.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.880]   But I think the site will be the beginning.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.040]   And just keep watching.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   We'll have details.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.400]   And Chris, you'll come back and tell us all about it once things.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.160]   He's really taking the lead on this, which is great.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   Alex Oh, for sure.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   Alex Thank you, Chris.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160]   Alex Thank you.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   Alex Yeah.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.160]   Alex I got anything else in the--
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.400]   Alex No, just Google for Chris.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.880]   Alex You'll find it all.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.200]   Alex Whatever I'm doing.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:24.720]   Alex I got my chest.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.480]   Alex It's just rent.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   Alex I'm sorry.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.680]   Alex It's not for sale.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   Alex You can only rent it right now.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680]   Alex Thank you, Chris.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   Alex Have a great night.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   Alex Have a great night.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680]   Alex Thanks, Leo.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.320]   Alex D L T V is the place for Patrick Norton.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.760]   And he does such a great job.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.400]   And tomorrow you're going to see his Conro.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.200]   It sounds dirty in action.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.600]   You're going to do that on the show tomorrow.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.600]   Alex We get our Conro coverage starting a couple weeks ago.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.640]   Alex But this new machine you're playing with is Falcon.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.480]   Alex and this ridiculously insanely fast machine.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.680]   Alex Yeah, that'll be fun.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.680]   Alex Well, thanks.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.280]   Alex Also amazing to realize that big fans are back.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.560]   Alex Big fans, really honking big grape honking big fans.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.760]   Alex Well, when this thing fires, I think I've got this set up so that it has more cooling
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   than--
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.720]   Alex The irony is it's a cool thing.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720]   Alex Cooler chip.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   Alex Yeah.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   Alex It's a more efficient cooler chip.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.400]   Alex Well, I think it's because gamers expect the big whoosh.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.320]   Alex These machines can actually be cooler, quieter, and faster, which is pretty amazing.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   Alex All right, Patrick.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.680]   Alex We're going to figure out how to adjust the fans.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.400]   Alex We'll see you tomorrow on dl.tv.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.520]   Alex Thanks for being here for a late night to it.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.680]   Alex A day late.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.680]   Alex Certainly not a dollar short.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.680]   Alex Take care of me.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.480]   Alex Have a good one, Leo.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.480]   Alex And we're going to--
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.840]   Alex We're going to let Doug K. go because he's got to do his server.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:48.640]   Alex Yeah, if all goes well, I'll have gigavox.com live before you get this show online.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.880]   Alex Let's hope I can do that.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.880]   Alex I think you will.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.800]   Alex Also, you know, we didn't mention the fact that you're going to be an instructor
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.280]   at the podcast Academy on September 28th in Ontario, California in conjunction with the
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.280]   portable media expo.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.040]   Alex Everybody who's coming to podcast expo absolutely should come a day early and-- or
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   it's just two days early.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.040]   Alex How long is podcast?
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.040]   Alex One day early.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.040]   Alex One day early.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.160]   And we have a great full day.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.000]   It's about half of it is all on video.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.280]   We've got some terrific video stuff, including Alex Lindsay's going to be there.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280]   Alex Oh, is he?
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   Oh, great.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.360]   Alex is doing a presentation, a class on video and like I say, half a day on video.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.680]   And the other half is really for the serious podcast and the professional, the consultant
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   and so forth.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.800]   And that's the half that you'll be in.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.760]   And because as we've always said, you have the perfect face for reading.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.240]   Alex I'm a serious podcaster.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.720]   And I don't even know what I'm talking about, but I'm sure we'll come up with something.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.520]   And the next day, of course, podcast expo.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.120]   Number two, which is really I think going to be amazing.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.800]   The first one was a surprise to everyone.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   Alex What a shock that was.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.800]   Wasn't that amazing?
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.320]   Alex Tim Borkwin who put it together of the podcast brothers didn't even know that he
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.560]   was kind of concerned about, he called it the Porta Mill Media Expo because he didn't
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.960]   know podcasting had any traction.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.760]   It's still the portable media expo officially.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.620]   But if you go to podcast expo.com, you'll find it.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.960]   And I'm doing the keynote there.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.580]   One of the things I'm going to talk about in the keynote, I'm really going to address
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.480]   what are the issues going forward for us as podcasters, both video and audio.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.660]   Because I think there's some things that we need to set the agenda on.
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:24.320]   So that's going to be fun.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   And then we're there to hear it.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   Alex Well, yeah.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.880]   Alex Well, and then please join me that afternoon because what we're going to do is we're not
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.960]   to do Twit there, but we're going to do a special, a Twit special from podcast Expo.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.920]   I figured silly to try to do Twit when really there's so many interesting people there.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.960]   We'll just do a podcast expo show.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960]   Please join me for that.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.120]   In fact, I'd like it if you'd co-host it with me because you know everybody.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.120]   Alex We'll do it together.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120]   Good.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.120]   Thank you.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.120]   Alex Thank you.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.120]   Alex Thank you.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   Alex Always a pleasure.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.120]   Alex Thank you.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.120]   Alex Thank you.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.120]   Alex Thank you.

[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.620]   Alex Timbeth I don't know what the answer is.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.620]   Alex Timbeth I really don't.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.620]   Alex Timbeth Let me introduce the table mates.
