[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   Hello, I'm Leo de Porte.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:08.440]   Welcome to the return of the episode two for April 24th, 2005.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:21.400]   Put down your 40s, gentlemen.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.680]   We're about to find out.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.560]   So what do you Patrick?
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.600]   You saw that Wall Street Journal article about Corey Greenberg.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.360]   You said you worked with Corey?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.640]   I used to read it.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.160]   I used to read his stuff in stereo file and a friend of mine.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.000]   A guy I worked with for a short period of time at Windows Sources,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   he became a friend of mine, was his editor for a while,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.480]   a couple different magazines.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.280]   Also, somebody was telling me that at least one of our former co-workers
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.000]   is making a fair amount of money.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.080]   I know who that former co-worker is, actually.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.280]   Well, I'll tell you why I saw her at PMA, the photo show.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.600]   She looked like she was doing TV.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.640]   And she's up on a stage.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.880]   And she's doing the thing with the gadgets.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.840]   And it looked like it was for--
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.000]   and so I said, well, what you doing?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.320]   She said, oh, it's a satellite media tour.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   And I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.480]   She said, well, what happens is we feed this to local news stations.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.040]   I can't remember if it was paying her Panasonic or somebody.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.280]   And I show them all the products.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.040]   And it's never identified as being paid for by a company.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.080]   It's very lucrative.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.240]   Yeah, it's very lucrative.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.320]   I don't blame her for doing it.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400]   But I get offers to do these a lot.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.760]   I've had several offers to do these.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.720]   And I always say no.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.360]   And this is the thing that bugs me just for people
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.280]   who didn't read the article.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.680]   Wall Street Journal kind of outed a number of tech journalists
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.120]   saying that they're getting paid by the companies.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.440]   They're plugging on these.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.360]   And the one they singled out was Corey Greenberg, who's
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.920]   the today show's gadget guy.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   And apparently he does.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   Now, what they-- it wasn't clear.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.160]   And maybe you got a better sense than I did, Patrick.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.360]   It didn't look like he'd been paid specifically
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.280]   for the today show appearances.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   But those companies had paid it in the past.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.880]   Well, one of the things--
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.280]   Yeah, I mean, one of the things that basically it was--
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.840]   one of the things it was the boy,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.360]   there's a sentence in here just yearning three.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.320]   But down the mic--
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.880]   Basically, he maintained that he was never paid to promote
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.560]   products he was discussing on NBC.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.960]   However, he had been promoted to do the tours by companies
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.000]   who, ironically enough, whose products he was demoing on NBC.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.840]   Yeah, so you got a one?
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.440]   And there was no disclosure of that.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.680]   That's the big thing.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.840]   It makes me mad too that NBC didn't say anything.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200]   Well, they basically-- they said in a couple
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.560]   of the follow-up articles that were at this,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.480]   said they've adjusted their policy.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.160]   But they also didn't get rid of the guy who
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.440]   got nailed for it publicly.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   We had this problem on call for help, remember, Gadget Girl.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.920]   Gadget Girl.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.480]   Gadget Girl.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.600]   We found out that her flights were being paid for by one
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.280]   of the companies.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.640]   And we said, sorry, you can't come back.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.840]   But the thing that bugs me is I think that people read this
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.800]   and assume that you and I and everybody else
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.520]   are all in the same basket.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.960]   Well, I mean, there was also--
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   I mean, one of my favorite--
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.880]   one of my favorite--
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.360]   because I tend not to read the threads
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   because they make me cry.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   But one of my favorite threads of all time
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   is somebody's like, man, do you want to powder?
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.600]   Totally owned by Intel.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.960]   Intel advertises up.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   And it was on a day where you and I just completely
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.640]   ripped Intel a new delete expletive because, you know,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   it's like Intel.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.640]   It's another processor.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.080]   It's a little bit faster than the last one.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.560]   It's a lot more expensive than AMD.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.440]   So why buy it?
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.920]   You know?
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.440]   Right.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.520]   And it was on the same day.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.560]   It was like those guys were sued by Intel.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.080]   It's like Intel pays their ads.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.640]   And we didn't even-- we're sitting in the studio.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.280]   We have no--
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.640]   We don't know.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   --commercials are running.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.320]   We have no idea.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.200]   I remember ripping-- remember the Pentium 3?
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   They had the ID encoded into it.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.840]   So they would know, you know, unique identifier.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.640]   And I said unequivocally on--
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.400]   this is on call for help.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.520]   Don't buy this chip.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.880]   This is terrible.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.520]   Intel should be spanked.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520]   Please, don't buy a Pentium 3 and immediately.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.800]   Like, we'll be right back.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.320]   And then doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.120]   Intel presents.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.040]   And I thought, you know, I didn't know this either.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.000]   And people sent me an answer.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.240]   You're going to get fired, dude.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.720]   But to the credit of our bosses, we never heard heat from that.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.600]   I've never taken money for that kind of thing.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.440]   But I do-- and I feel guilty about this.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.720]   I do have advertisers on the radio show.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.840]   And they pay me to do their ads.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.240]   So--
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.360]   But are you going to fund it out of your own pocket?
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.840]   No way.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.920]   You have to feed your children and have a house.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.600]   You know, I kind of feel like radio.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.440]   It's kind of accepted.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.040]   I mean, you look at Paul Harvey doing ads for Bose.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.880]   You know, Charles Osgood's doing ads.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.360]   It seems like on radio, it's kind of an old-timey medium
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.600]   where the hosts read the ads.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.960]   So it's kind of more accepted.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.440]   I just-- you know, I feel bad because I think that it's now
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   difficult for people to tell who's on the up and up
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.240]   and who's not.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   And it makes it hard for me to say things like, gosh,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.840]   I really love Mac OS X because then I think people say, well,
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.600]   of course he does.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.280]   Apple's paying him or something like that, which they're not.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.600]   Kevin, how do you feel about it?
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.680]   Well, you know, I don't really see a problem with accepting
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.440]   goods or services as long as you let people know that up front.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.360]   You have to tell it.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.400]   You have to tell the people that are giving it to you
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.240]   because I've accepted free software in the past.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.480]   But I say, you know, I'm not going to give you a plug for this.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.080]   I'm not going to rent and rave about it.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.640]   Well, that's part of the review process.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.760]   I mean, we all get stuff in the mail.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   Right.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.320]   That's different from getting paid tens of thousands of dollars
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.000]   to do fake television news.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.800]   Yeah, see, it's not that fake.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.080]   I mean, how much television news is actually delivered?
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.680]   Once you take out fires and plane crashes and car crashes
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.880]   and covering a court event, I mean,
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.680]   how much television news actually involves people going out
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.720]   and digging and researching and doing hands-on?
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.760]   I mean, there's some good consumer reporters out there.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.720]   But there's also a lot of press release.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.880]   Right.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.560]   Now, if you see a drug company, if you see a drug report
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.240]   on local television news, it's guaranteed you.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.280]   It's produced by the drug company.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.680]   I mean, inevitably.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   Right.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.080]   These VNRs.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.120]   Hey, we were going to say something about OS 10, Patrick.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.280]   I'm sorry, I cut you off.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.720]   I was going to say apparently OS 10 was shipped early.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.240]   Yeah, did you just--
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.720]   I want you to deal with it.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.160]   Well, not just dealers.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.040]   And users got FedEx.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.120]   Somebody in my chat room said FedEx came yesterday
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.040]   with OS 10 tiger.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.920]   Nice.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.680]   That's great.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   Mac Mall sent a bunch of them out,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.360]   and then they issued a recall.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.840]   Please send it back.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   How many people do you think send it back?
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.040]   None.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.960]   I'm calling it OS 10 Liger.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.880]   Have you guys Napoleon Dynamite fans?
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.240]   Have you seen Napoleon Dynamite?
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.360]   Eh, I'm not a big fan.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.760]   Oh, dude.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.680]   I loved watching it.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.560]   I'll probably never watch it again.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.920]   I feel the same way.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.720]   I'm with you, Pat.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.240]   Oh, man.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.960]   I'm a big-- you know, I guess I can--
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.000]   No, rain of fire.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.360]   I could watch over and over again.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.680]   What's rain of fire?
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   Tell me about that.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.840]   The movie with the dragons?
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.040]   Oh, that's supposed to be really good.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   Well, it's like a '50s horror movie.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.120]   Oh, I was thinking that Kung Fu this year's--
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.720]   what was that?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.480]   Kung Kung Fu.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.280]   Oh, I can't remember your name.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.720]   I'm badly.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.840]   Have you been playing with the tiger at all, Leo?
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.840]   No, I keep trying to download it from BitTorrent.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.000]   And this is the problem I have with BitTorrent.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.640]   By the way, I will buy it when it comes out.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.960]   But I'm just trying to get a copy ahead of time.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.640]   And the problem I have with BitTorrent
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.400]   is unless there's a lot of seeds.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.280]   Everybody has the first half of the file.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.720]   And nobody has the second half.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.840]   So you get stalled out, right?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.440]   You know, it really pisses me off
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.280]   because I can't get anything unless there's
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.320]   a bunch of good seeds that have the full file.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.840]   And this is what's happened with Tiger.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.880]   There's a gold master of Tiger, supposedly, on the torrents.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.400]   But I won't.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.880]   I never know because I only get halfway through.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.040]   And it just dies.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.560]   I guess I'm going to--
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560]   Yeah, I've been having some issues with it.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.240]   Yeah, with torrent?
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.560]   No, with Tiger.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.520]   Have you really?
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.880]   Yeah, there's some problems with it.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.760]   Mike, what?
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.240]   Well, I have some friends that are running Tiger.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.320]   They're running the last version.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.560]   And I can't connect via iChat with them properly.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.600]   There's just some issues.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.360]   Well, I'd like to next week try--
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.120]   I'll be in line Friday of 6 to get my copy.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.640]   And maybe we can try next Sunday doing this with the iChat.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.120]   The kind of file.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.200]   I want to get the iSight set up and try that out.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.120]   Yeah, let's try it.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.840]   Well, at least try it.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.800]   We can feed both video and audio.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.200]   There's no reason to have to just feed one or the other.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.220]   I'm curious to see what the H.264 looks like.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.580]   Yeah, that's the new HD codec that's supposedly highly scalable.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.100]   Steve showed it at the keynote.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.420]   And he would take a window, small window on the screen,
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.220]   and then stretch it to full high def.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.700]   And while the thing's playing, it looked great.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.620]   Yeah, we're going to be compressing some more videos
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.340]   with that just to try it out.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.620]   You think you'll do system as 364 or what, or 264?
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.660]   Yeah, we'll do it a quick time.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.420]   And Windows Media and probably kick out of Divx as well.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.580]   It's a shame we have to do all these different codecs.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.700]   I know.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.060]   It's not that hard, I guess.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.780]   Yeah, that's too bad.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.900]   We don't have to.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.300]   Just could we get upset if you don't?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.420]   Well, I was surprised.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.860]   You know, once this podcast was slash-dotted,
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.980]   until then everybody was fine with MP3.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.300]   And all of a sudden we got all these requests
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.220]   for ag-vorbis versions.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.060]   The slash.crowd wants vorbis.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.660]   So I'll do a vorbis.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.300]   But watch, you know, a bit of 1% of the total downloads.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.140]   We got to come up--
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.300]   It's a very vocal 1%.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.140]   Yeah, they are.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.780]   I got a cease and desist letter from G4,
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.380]   saying you can't use the name of the screen.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.100]   This bleep.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.740]   So somebody suggested that we should
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.660]   call this the revenge of these green saviors.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.540]   What do you think?
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.220]   No?
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:55.780]   No.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.140]   OK.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140]   No.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.940]   Brought to you by Simple Green.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.740]   These greens today were inducted to clean up
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.900]   the commuting pay.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.140]   That's another thing I want to raise.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.900]   We should really get some product placement in here, guys.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.540]   This is a chance.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.580]   Kevin, are you drinking Red Bull and vodka
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.260]   while we're doing this?
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.780]   Something.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.260]   You know, we got to--
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.180]   Yeah, we could do something like that.
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.580]   Brought to you by Red Bull.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.100]   In Canada, there's a whole big issue
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.620]   with people drinking Red Bull and vodka.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.020]   And they don't--
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.300]   Red Bull is kind of hard to get because of it.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.660]   Really?
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.500]   What's the deal?
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   I don't know.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.100]   Can a Canadian health--
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.580]   It's all going to the people drinking it.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.180]   Well, you know, first of all, it's probably not
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.660]   a good combination because it's a stimulant and a depressant.
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.020]   And you know, it's like a speed ball.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.780]   And it's very cheap, hippie ball.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.700]   And you drink three of them, you're
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.300]   going to have a heart attack.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.100]   Because there's a ton of caffeine.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.820]   And I don't know.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.860]   I guess there goes the Red Bull product placement.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.180]   Yeah, you know, I don't think the whole Red Bull killing
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.540]   people has been a major problem.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.380]   I don't think it has as much coffee as caffeine as coffee
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.380]   really.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.300]   Yeah, but nobody's drinking vodka and black coffee.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.860]   Or are they?
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.940]   No, no.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.540]   See, here in San Francisco, they called an Irish coffee.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.220]   And it's coffee and whiskey.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.820]   So anyway, I got this letter.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.860]   So what are we going to call this darn thing?
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.060]   I'd say we sent to the users.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.180]   Let them come up with the name.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.540]   All right.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.380]   We should have a contest.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.380]   All right.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.940]   We'll have a contest.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.780]   And what will the prize be?
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.780]   The glory of having me--
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.700]   I will send them a box of stuff I'm clearing out of my--
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.500]   Good, Rod.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   I like it.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.500]   It's a surprise package.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.700]   What's in Patrick's garage?
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.420]   Find out for yourself.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.740]   All right.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.900]   Let's set up a Gmail account.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.540]   And we can just use an existing one.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.700]   You want to do that?
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.500]   I've got one already, a generic one.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.020]   We'll call it Leo's Program at gmail.com.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.780]   L-E-O-S program, P-R-O-G-R-A-M.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.420]   I created that because I didn't know what the name of the
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.660]   program was at gmail.com.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.220]   Send us your submissions.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.220]   In the subject line.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.220]   In the subject line.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220]   You're right.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.220]   Good thinking, Kevin.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.220]   You've done this before.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.940]   For the name of this dang show and anything else you want to
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:16.100]   say, and we will consider it in the box of Patrick's old crap.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.900]   We'll go to the winner.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.020]   Old computer parts.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.460]   Vintage computer parts.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.700]   Will you sign a few of those?
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.820]   Hey, I'll sign them all.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.820]   Kevin and I will help defray the shipping.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.220]   No play, no sledgehammers.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.220]   Nothing.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.420]   I don't know if that's a good prize or not.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.820]   There could be some real crap in there.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.420]   Well, what are you, should we throw in something else?
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.420]   I don't know, Pat.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   What are you talking about?
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.020]   What are you actually going to be giving people?
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.020]   Is it just busted up broken computer parts?
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.020]   No, no, no.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.020]   Everything will be usable.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.020]   It'll just be very vintage.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.420]   How about some like, you know, 96 Intel Pentium board.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.420]   There you go.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.420]   Looking for some Isom modem cards.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.020]   I found two boxes of computer parts that have been hauling around.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.020]   I'll tell you that.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.620]   They were state of the art when I left Jersey in '97.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.180]   My, um, '97, wow.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:13.740]   My web host, uh, VisaWeb is willing to give away, um, some, uh, I think they're year long
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.420]   accounts, a plan for, uh, they're, they're these site builder express accounts.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.140]   Uh, worth 10 bucks a month.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.780]   It'll be a hundred twenty dollar value.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.900]   So, uh, let's pick, I'll give one to the, the five finalists.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.900]   How about that?
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.900]   Okay, hold on.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.900]   I got something for you then too.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.900]   All right.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.900]   We're at the prize here.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.900]   Here we go.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   My, uh, my buddies run Jinx.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.180]   So I'll give away five T-shirts for the five finalists.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.300]   Uh, any Jinx shirt that they want on the side.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   Okay.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.300]   So here's the deal gang.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   Cool.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.980]   It's email leosprogram@gmail.com with your favorite name for this show, this podcast.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.460]   Put it in the subject line.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.820]   Uh, Kevin, Patrick, I and, uh, whoever else, Robert Heron's out of town today, but when
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.220]   he gets back, he can be involved with it.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.220]   Yoshi's going to join us.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.500]   Are you supposed to join us anytime now?
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   He'll be involved.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.660]   We'll vote on the top five.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:07.780]   Those, uh, all top five will receive a year, uh, web hosting from VisaWeb and, uh, Jinx
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.780]   T-shirt.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.780]   What, what is it going to say, you know?
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.900]   Uh, whatever they want, there's just a bunch of different hackers and gamer T-shirts,
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.900]   uh, you name it.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.060]   You, you pick your shirt and then the winner gets a box of Patrick's crap.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.940]   I like it.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:27.900]   You get the T-shirt and the year long membership at VisaWeb and this box of crap.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   All right.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.580]   I think that's a contest gang and see we didn't have to go to the lawyers or anything.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   That's awesome.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.780]   I wonder if we, I wonder if there is any, you know, liability here.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.380]   Ask, grow it.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.860]   What else is a, a, a track company?
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.860]   I'm sure there is.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.860]   What else is a track?
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.860]   We're in California.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.500]   One of every six lawyers in the United States is here in California where there's
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.820]   somebody can figure out some pretense to sue us.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   Hey, I, I, I owe an apology to Canada.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.820]   I'd like to apologize to the entire nation of Canada for, for saying that this, my TV
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.780]   show didn't count because it was in Canada.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.740]   That was a joke gang.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.260]   But I got some nasty mail.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.540]   People were hurt and I didn't mean to hurt their family.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.620]   I'm, I'm grateful to Canada.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.620]   I love going up to Canada.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.020]   Kevin, you're coming in a couple of weeks.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.060]   Patrick, we got to get you up there.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.620]   I will, I will eventually get there.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.620]   Toronto's great.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.420]   Especially once the sun comes out.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.900]   It's just a beautiful city.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.900]   Did you read some of the comments?
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.580]   I mean, people are really, very happy with this podcast.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.580]   God knows why.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.580]   That's awesome.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.580]   It puts the pressure on though.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.540]   We got to come up with something good every week now.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.140]   So, Patrick, you had some other things you wanted to talk about.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.140]   I forgot.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.140]   I have your email here somewhere.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.380]   What else is on your mind these days?
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.380]   Oh man.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.380]   Wait, but let me look.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.380]   I'll tell you.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.380]   I'll remind you.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.380]   64-bit windows tomorrow.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.380]   I mean, Monday.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.380]   Yeah, tomorrow.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.380]   You excited?
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.940]   I can't even.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.940]   Oh, oh.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.940]   Oh.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.940]   Is there any-
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.940]   Is there any-
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.940]   People have been using the beta for a while.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.500]   I don't even, I don't know if you see anything.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.620]   Is the FX64 from Athlon?
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.820]   Is that, would that benefit from running 64-bit windows or no?
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.540]   Well, see, it's for running.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.300]   There's no 64-bit applications, right?
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.540]   Except for what's out there.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.940]   So 64-bit Linux, which people have been running.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.940]   Right.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.940]   I don't know.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.940]   Streaming.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.340]   It's kind of interesting that they're finally actually shipping the 64-bit code.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.340]   Right.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.300]   Now that everybody's demanding it.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   I'm pretty interested, I'm interested because I have a 64-bit chip, you know, so I'd like
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.700]   to install and test it out.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.020]   But tell me, is it completely backwards compatible?
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.020]   No.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.580]   Are there going to be any problems with old applications?
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.380]   Tons of problems.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.380]   Tons of problems.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.380]   Really?
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.380]   Why do you say that?
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.380]   Well, just from what I've heard, a lot of applications don't run on it.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.380]   Really?
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.380]   Because I know you have to get special drivers.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.860]   You have to go redone the 64-bit version of your drivers that you want for your video
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860]   card and whatnot.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.860]   So I don't know.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.860]   I'm going to hold off for a while.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.860]   Running the beta has been a problem.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.260]   You know, I have to think some of this is a response to Intel.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.100]   I'll never forget doing an interview with Andy Grove some years ago.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.940]   And on camera, of course, he's judicious and careful and won't say anything bad about
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   Microsoft.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.540]   But off camera, he was furious about Microsoft.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.860]   And the reason is Intel will come up with, at this time they'd come up with a 32-bit chip.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:14.020]   And Microsoft was still shipping a 16-bit operating system and is lagging way behind.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.460]   And it's the same situation here where the hardware is 64-bit.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.860]   But Microsoft is still a 32-bit OS until just now.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.100]   So I think some of it is just that, is it?
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.740]   Just to keep the chip makers from biting their heads off.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.020]   I mean, my question, Leo, my question to you is this though.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.660]   I mean, with 64-bit chips, we see different barriers being broken with the amount of memory
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.260]   that you can have on a system and whatnot.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.300]   But I mean, we've seen this in OS 10 now for a while with the 64-bit version of the OS.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.180]   But I can still open more, pretty much the same amount that I can on a PC.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.100]   I mean, what real advantages?
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   There's no advantage.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100]   There's no advantage.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100]   You hit the nail on that.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.660]   The only advantage is you get more memory.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.660]   Right.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.660]   That's it.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.020]   Well, I mean, if you're one of those people who's working with 32-gigabyte databases.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.020]   And it's good.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.020]   Genormous video files.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.020]   It's great.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.940]   But yeah, I mean, like the classic is like, I run, you know, open office and Mozilla.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.660]   And I want it to be faster.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.420]   I buy a 3.6-gighertz processor.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.100]   How fast do you search and replace words in your novel?
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.100]   Exactly.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.100]   Exactly.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.860]   And I guess, you know, as we start operating on bigger chunks of data with encoding, theoretically,
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:28.340]   having a big 64-bit register will make it easier to, you know, make MP3s or, you know,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.060]   encode MPEG-2 or whatever.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.380]   But I don't know.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.380]   I mean, I think that that's the whole point of, you know, these, Altevec and the SIMD stuff,
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.860]   the SSX stuff where it's multiple, you know, single instruction, multiple data where you
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.500]   can operate one instruction over a bunch of data.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.980]   And I guess 64-bit of give you an advantage there.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.900]   That's what, it's certainly, that's what, Aflon 64 looks pretty good, right?
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.460]   And, you know, things like ripping.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.460]   We need Robert Herrim to introduce this.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.100]   I think it's a little processor of choice.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.100]   That's what I've-
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.100]   More interesting.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.100]   What's interesting?
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.140]   Oh, just looking at the performance of the new, the new dual core operands, which seem
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.220]   to be from what I was really like extreme tech just did a pretty big, pretty hard look
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:16.260]   at the dual core CPUs from AMD and found the, the optoron outperforming the Intel.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.260]   So it's kind of-
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.900]   That's a hot chip, I think, in more ways than one.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.900]   Did you see what?
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.900]   I was gonna say pricewatch.com.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.900]   Let's see how much I was-
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900]   Let's check the prices.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.220]   Somebody asked me on the radio show, I didn't really have a good answer for them.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.940]   If you were gonna build a gaming machine, would you get a dual Xeon or not a gaming machine,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.940]   but no, you wouldn't.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.060]   Even like for video editing, a dual Xeon or would you get is hyper threading worth it
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.260]   or would you just get the Athlon 64, FX64, which is not hyper threading?
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.780]   You'd get an Athlon FX64.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.780]   Yeah, so far.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.500]   So, the Vian has never really impressed me that much for the amount of money they cost.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.300]   It's all about the cash, baby.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.940]   And I mean, the cash with a CHE.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.940]   Yeah, I have a-
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.820]   Well, I mean, I was just gonna say I have a dual Xeon box, but it's my web server.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.820]   Do you really?
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.820]   In your house?
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.820]   No, at the host.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   It's on the rack.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.820]   I suppose.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   But you know, that's what they're best for.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   I mean, I'm running Linux on it.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.820]   It's great.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.820]   Yeah, it's server.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.820]   It makes sense.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   Just see this-
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.820]   So, there we go.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.820]   Optron 275 dual core 2.2 gigahertz.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.820]   That's $1,300.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.820]   That's not bad.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:25.820]   The dual core 1.8 gigahertz, the Optron 265 is running $857.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.700]   Now, see, that's good.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.900]   That's about the same as an FX, right?
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.420]   So which would you rather have?
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.420]   Probably an Athlon 64.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.900]   Actually, I mean, because I started looking at somebody, and I'm gonna buy, I've got a
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:46.820]   500, one of the original $500 gaming PCs here, and I'm gonna buy a 6600 GT graphics
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.700]   car, but this is gonna be like a hundred bucks, $135.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.620]   Gee me a massive graphics boost.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:58.740]   And I've got, you know, 750 megabytes of RAM in a 2.6 processor, and really, you know,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.220]   unless I want to update the motherboard, I'm not gonna get that much more perform.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.220]   You know, performance out of a major processor upgrade, but not spending another $500.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.220]   I'll be honest with you, I don't feel a lot of, I have a 2.4 gigahertz Pentium 4.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.220]   I don't see a lot of pressure.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.220]   I don't feel a lot of pressure to upgrade that even.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:18.220]   Yeah, I just recently bought a brand new 64 3500 Plus.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.220]   Did you?
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.220]   I didn't want to go FX.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.220]   I was just like, yeah, that's fine.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.220]   It's fast enough.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.220]   It runs Half-Life 2 just fine.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.220]   I'm happy.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.220]   Yeah, it's a nice chip.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.220]   What are you playing these days?
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.220]   You're doing any, remember we used to always play on the set.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.220]   We'd do the LAN parties.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.220]   You guys do that?
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.220]   I mean, not just the, I know you do LAN parties, but are you guys behind the scenes playing
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.220]   online like we used to?
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.220]   Not really.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.220]   I don't play a whole lot of games there, but yeah.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220]   Bretonno is off.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.220]   Bretonno doesn't do that anymore?
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.220]   No, not anymore.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.220]   Now that he's a big shot.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220]   That's right.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.220]   Well, they move, the part of the problem is that we used to have a place for the gaming
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   rigs and they wouldn't move them and now they take them off set.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.220]   Oh, that sucks.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.220]   They break them apart.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.220]   People don't realize, I mean, this was actually starting to be a problem on the screensavers
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.220]   set is that even in commercial breaks, everybody would start sitting down playing Halo 2 or
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.220]   Halo 1, I guess it was.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.220]   And, you know, we weren't paying attention to anything.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.220]   We were just playing the game and then the TV show was just in the way.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.220]   That's right.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   That was so much fun.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.220]   It's a pain in the butt.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.220]   You were getting good there, bro.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.220]   No, I'll never.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.220]   Bretonno was just, you and Bretonno are the kings.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.220]   You were the kings.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.220]   That was fun, though.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   Patrick, you and I would sit down and we'd just get wiped up with those guys.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.220]   So depressing.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.220]   Hey, did you see this?
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:40.220]   The Canadian judge is holding a teenager's PlayStation hostage until he serves his time
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.220]   and does his counseling.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.220]   I think this is appropriate punishment.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:50.220]   They said you can't have the PlayStation until you're done with your community's surface.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   What did the child do?
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.220]   He's only 14.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.220]   How bad could it be?
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.220]   But I guess if you go in front of a judge--
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.220]   That's the last time your life's your little sister on fire.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.220]   It must have been something, right?
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.220]   I mean, you know, the judge doesn't get involved unless he did something bad.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.220]   What else?
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.220]   I'm just trying to think.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.220]   What else we can talk about?
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.220]   You know, I want to put some content in this so it's not just a bunch of guys sitting around
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.220]   BSing.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.220]   Is that hopeless?
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.220]   I want the Apple camera connector to work on non-photo iPods.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.220]   Okay.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.220]   There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   Just the new Apple's camera connector, which is like $29.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220]   Isn't that great?
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.220]   Plugged into Doc connector iPods.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.220]   But you have Apple Phone?
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.220]   It only works on the photos.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.220]   Well, why do you think?
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.220]   I mean, obviously they could make it work on the other ones, but--
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.220]   Well, Bell can make it--
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.220]   Somebody said there was some USB logic in the photos, but I'm not sure I'm buying into that.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.220]   Well, that might be.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.220]   It's kind of actually-- I'm kind of excited.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.220]   It's actually-- I now have someone who answers my phone calls at Apple.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.220]   It's a very exciting develop for me as somebody is reviewing a lot of Apple products.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.220]   Because you're with iPod extreme iPod.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.220]   Yeah, or extreme iPod, yeah.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.220]   Hey, what's about those rumors that we're going to see in new iPod this summer?
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.220]   Is that-- you think that's true?
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.220]   There should be something coming out in June.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:12.220]   What it's going to be is anybody's guess, although some people are suggesting that there's going to be wireless headphones.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.220]   Like basically the wireless iPod coming out, which I think it's a little early for that yet.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:22.220]   And I think the available technologies used for wireless headphones would be a little cumbersome.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.220]   Right.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   Are we talking like Bluetooth? Is that what they're thinking?
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:31.220]   I don't think they'd want to use-- I think Bluetooth is just too big and takes too much power.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.220]   It's too low-fi too, isn't it?
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:39.220]   And that's where it gets kind of interesting, because it could be proprietary wireless technology.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.220]   What about just FM modulation?
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.220]   I mean, you already-- I mean, it's easy enough to put an FM modulator in this thing.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.220]   FM modulator sound horrible.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.220]   I'm glad to hear you say that, because they always sound like they were a little crunchy little compressed to me.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:58.220]   They always sound crunchy and compressed. I mean, I've actually reviewed the word extremeipod.com.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.220]   Not that I'm going to say that.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.220]   You mean extremeipod.com?
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.220]   One more time.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.220]   The extremeipod.com.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:15.220]   But we did like to-- I looked at DLLO's trans pod and the-- I can't-- they see me the eye trip from Griffin and monsters.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.220]   And they're all pretty much equal. They all kind of hit a target mod-- a target product.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.220]   Like the Griffin eye trip, it's very-- it matches the shape and the color of the iPod and the air style.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.220]   That's the one I use.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:33.220]   The DLLO's got to basically-- it's this giant iPod on a stick that you plug into your lighter socket and has the radio built in.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:38.220]   And it amazes me like if it's raining, if it's not raining, which side of a hill you're on?
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.220]   Whether or not you have a good or bad FM radio where the antenna is located all has a dramatic impact.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   And at their best, they can all sound pretty good.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:54.220]   And then you can basically turn a corner and be next to a transformer and have a giant static go into your signal.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.220]   And it was actually outside of Laramie, Wyoming.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:03.220]   Like the 19th time and a thousand mile trip that the channel I was on got stomped on by a local radio station.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.220]   That's the problem.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.220]   There's always great little radio stations like coming across Nevada and the-- you know, they'll change.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   And there's not enough power in the FM transmitters that are used for portable electronics to really give you any kind of power or signal quality that's comparable.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.220]   It's something-- the more time I spend with them, the more frustrating it gets.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   Yeah, I just use a little cassette adapter.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.220]   Of course, many cars don't have cassettes anymore, but that works fine.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   It's getting hard to find cars with cassettes anymore.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:38.220]   When are they going to start putting an audio jack in the dashboard so I could plug in my device?
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.220]   It's totally varying on which Jensen does it.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.220]   It depends on the jack.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.220]   Some of them have a jack in the front.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:53.220]   Some actually have AP inputs, AV inputs, regular RCA jack in the back of the head unit.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:27:00.220]   Sony does it, JVC does it on some models, Jensen does it on some models, Pioneer doesn't do it on any models.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.220]   So you could get an aftermarket?
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.220]   You can get an aftermarket that'll have it.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.220]   How about a USB plug?
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.220]   It's going to be big this year with iPod, is everybody's coming out with their-- I'm sorry?
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.220]   I just would like a USB jack.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   I could plug my shuffle into.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.220]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   It would be cool, but it's interesting.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.220]   It's interesting.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.220]   The shuffle came out right about the time all the manufacturers finished their connector compatible design.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.220]   The first one was out was from--
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:32.220]   Oh, I can't remember the name of the company.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.220]   It starts with an A, Alpine.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   Monsters coming out with-- everybody's coming out with CD changer adapters for the iPods.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:44.220]   You can really see that there's a development cycle because how long's the iPod been out?
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.220]   And they're just now getting around to it.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:52.220]   I think a lot of it's just concerned whether or not they're going to change the dock connector.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.220]   Well, I could see that.
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.220]   You wouldn't want to really be beholden to Apple and on all that.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.220]   That's why I should just be a mini jack.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.220]   Just give me a mini jack.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.220]   That's all I want.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.220]   That's what it is.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.220]   There's very few head units that actually offer mini jack on.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:13.220]   Basically, the more low cost the head unit is, it seems like the more likely it is to actually have an 8-inch photo jack.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.220]   That's funny, that's true.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.220]   I saw some Iowa--
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   You got a $50.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.220]   Yeah, I was saying, "Pata says some Iowa head units like that that were like a hundred bucks that had lining in the front."
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.220]   So then I'm like, "I really want an Iowa head unit."
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.220]   You know?
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.220]   You know, depends on how loud your car is.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:36.220]   I was sitting there listening to the really good scab end from Virginia called the "Pightasters."
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   I used to go see all the time back east.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.220]   They had a live concert that was taped that they did for XM Radio.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   So I got a free trial of XM Radio online so I can listen to the satellite broadcast over the internet on my computer of a band from Virginia.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.220]   Which is just surreal enough as it is.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.220]   I was sitting there and I was like, "This is great. I love these guys."
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   They've written all these wonderful songs.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   The new stuff sounds good.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.220]   I just kind of jamming away on it.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   As long as I'm jamming away on it, I don't really notice how really you're going to be.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.220]   Really grainy and sounds like an over compressed MP3 from 1998.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   The audio quality sounds like on the satellite stuff.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.220]   You mean like this podcast?
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.220]   You mean like this podcast?
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.220]   Yes.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.220]   Yes, exactly.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.220]   Speaking of which, we're going to have to wrap up.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:34.220]   We're going to have to wrap this up pretty quick because we're trying to make this exactly the length of Rob from Sunnyvale's commute.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.220]   And he tells me it's 34.5 minutes.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.220]   No.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   We can't go any longer than that.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:47.220]   No, I think that's one of the things that's happening by the way is that Pete, that's one of the things people are doing with podcasts.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.220]   It's for commutes.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.220]   And the more people spend time in cars, the more this is going to be a popular medium.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.220]   It's an interesting thought.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   You've got to make it just like the iPod or Dog or it has like over 5,000 podcasts tracking now.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.220]   5,000.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.220]   One with this one.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.220]   How's system going? Are you still working on that?
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:14.220]   It's going great. Hopefully next weekend we should have, well, I'm not going to say it an exact date, but hopefully within the next week, we can have, we'll have something out and ready to release.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.220]   Two videos actually.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.220]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.220]   You're doing two at once.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.220]   It's like the Lord of the Rings thing.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.220]   You're just going to do it all simultaneously and ship them.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.220]   That's right.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:30.220]   I'll have some of the devices to talk about that we have actually invented for system for one of the segments.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   It's going to be a world's first.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.220]   Oh, cool.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.220]   So we'll talk about that now here as well.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.220]   Oh, yeah. Be very afraid.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   We're talking custom circuit creation and everything.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.220]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.220]   Anyway, guys, I thank you for your time.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.220]   This concludes another edition of the Revenge of the Bleep.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:51.220]   Or is it the return of the Bleep or the bleep of the bleep?
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   Bleep bleep.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   We'll talk again next week, yes?
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.220]   Sounds good.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.220]   All right.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.220]   Thanks, guys.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   And those of you who are wondering where Robert Herrin is, he was on a plane.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   Couldn't make it this week, but he'll be back next week.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   And don't know what happened to Yoshi.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   We'll make sure that he shows up next week.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.220]   That's it for this edition of the Bleep of the Bleep.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:20.220]   Anybody wants to, I don't know, product placement, send us cash or just send us email.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.220]   We'd love to hear from you, especially if you've got a good idea for the name of the show.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.220]   We just, this cannot go on.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:33.220]   L-E-O-S Leo's Program, B-O-G-R-A-M kind of a generic name, until we find a better one.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.220]   At gmail.com, purchase a suggestion in the subject line.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.220]   And again, the top five choices.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.220]   Win a year's hosting from VisuWeb and find Jinx T-shirt.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.220]   And the winner gets a box of Patrick's crap.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.220]   Have a good week.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.220]   Bye-bye.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:32:00.220]   [MUSIC]
