[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [ Sound Effects ]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   >> Netcast you love.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   >> From people you trust.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   >> This is Twit.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   >> Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   >> This is Twit.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   This weekend tech, episode 91,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   from March 18, 2007,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   all at Twitter.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   >> It's time to Twit and a fun panel today.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   In fact, a first for Twit,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   we're doing it on talk shoe as well on a front of a live audience.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   So what we're going to do today is do our usual Twit round table,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   talking about the news of the day,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   and then we will open the lines to this talk show audience,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   talk shoe audience.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So if you're listening in talk shoe to our live stream right now,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   go ahead and get in the queue,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and we'll just go through the queue one by one.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It will take us about 45 minutes to get to that.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Meanwhile, let me introduce the panel because we've got a great one.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   In fact, two guys I've wanted to get on for a long time.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   One who's been on Twit, I think once or twice before,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Robert Scobel, the scobelizer.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   >> Yay!
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   >> Yay!
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   >> How are you doing?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   >> Oh, it's great to have you,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   and I wanted to have you want to talk about South by Southwest
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   because I know you were there.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   >> It was all barbecue, man.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   >> In fact, at some point,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I wanted to turn off Twitter because it was basically,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   that's all I was hearing, was, you know,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I'm having barbecue next to Dan Rather.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I think that was Merlin Mansour.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> I got home and my wife yelled at me for saying Twitter.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   She said, "If I ever say Twitter again around her,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm sipping on the couch."
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> Also, this Alex Lindsay, who was also at South by Southwest
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hey, Alex, good to talk to you.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   >> Hey, I had barbecue too.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   >> We missed you while you were gone.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> I missed you too, Leo.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   >> Yeah, we're glad you're back, man.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   >> Alex is the host of many shows, including Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Of course, he's the head honcho at Pixel Core.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now with our own podcast site, PixelCore.tv,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   which is linked directly from Twit.tv as well.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So we're brothers in arms.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   >> It looks oddly similar to Twit.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   >> It does, but a better color scheme, I must say.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I like your color scheme.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm about to steal it.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And now, fella, I've wanted to get on Twit for a long, long time.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   An old friend.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I think one of the real visionaries in this business,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   one of the authors of the Clue Train Manifesto,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   he is just a brilliant guy on the subject.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Doc Serrel, it's great to talk to you from--
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   >> It's great to be on, too.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Thanks a lot.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   >> It's a Barbara.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, I'm hiding on the center, Barbara.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   We're normally-- it's beautiful, but today it's gloomy, so--
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> You're a teaching at UCSB.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   >> Well, you know, I have a visiting fellow at UCSB,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   or a research fellow, depending on which letter from which
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   chancellor is something that we go by, which means we have
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   a parking pass and a half in office and a bunch of stuff
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   like that.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   But I'm not teaching.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   No, I'm actually working in slow motion on a book,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   which if I talk about, we'll make a go even slower,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   so I'll hold off on that.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> I think there's a--
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> I don't know what to ask you.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> But that's basically it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And the interesting thing is, I also have a fellow with--
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   at the Berkman Center at Harvard, which means that I get to
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   save a relationship with two universities that never would
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   have let me in as a student.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> And two really prestigious programs to be there.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> They're great, they're great universities.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And it's the Berkman Center at Wiccaison,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and to get a plug-in, the Center for Information Technology
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and Society at UCSB.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> So, UC's doing some amazing stuff.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We just interviewed a guy named Smart from UCIT2,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   which is the joint venture I think of UCLA and UC San Diego.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   >> Is that a name like a droid?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> Yeah, it's not a great name, but it's their media lab,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and it's fascinating what they're up to.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Just amazing.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So neat stuff going on.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So, well, let's talk a little bit about South by Southwest,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and then I want to get to the big story of the week,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   which of course is Viacom's lawsuit against YouTube.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Did you go to South by Southwest, Doc?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   >> No, no, I missed it this year.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I decided to take time off from going to conferences,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   and actually, after my kid, we have a 10-year-old boy
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   wanted my schedule so we know when I was home.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I decided that was about the time to hold off in the next day.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I have to spend a week a month in Boston anyway.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> Dad, can you sink your blackberry with mine?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Because I can't figure out when you're home.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   >> Why can't you simply...
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   >> We don't let him use any of that.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   >> Oh, you will.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> You will.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> Robert has a ninth grader, or a seventh grader,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I should say.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Is Patrick used a blackberry or anything like that?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> No, no, no.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   He has a little sprint phone that he carries around.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> Everybody has cell phones.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I mean, my 12-year-old has a cell phone.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I mean, that's a given.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   >> I have to be my 12-year-old does not have a cell phone,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   but she has informed me that it is time for her to have a cell phone.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   >> Falva?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It is time.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   >> You want an iPhone?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> You want an iPhone, but I can't justify a 600-dollar trip.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   >> My daughter is working with a beat-up old sprint phone,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and I say, "Let me get you a new one."
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   She says, "No, no, I'm waiting for the iPhone.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You'll be getting me that, papa."
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And let's add one more.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Let's add one more voice to the conversation from across the pond,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Will Harris from...
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Well, formerly of...
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I guess he's still a bit tech, but now of willharris.co.uk.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Hello, Will!
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   >> Oh, it's so amazing.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The best quality Skype, and it's from Britain.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   >> Yes, it works pretty well.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> I don't understand it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And it's the middle of the night.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Maybe that's why, because nobody's on Skype right now.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   >> Nobody's online.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Well, you didn't go to South by Southwest.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I know that.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> No, unfortunately, I was kind of stuck here being envious of everybody else.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> Well, I was envious until I started getting inundated on Twitter with postings.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Let's ask Robert a little bit about South by Southwest.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   What was the most impressive thing?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   What was your sense of what went on there?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   >> Well, the interesting thing was I asked hundreds of people,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   "Have you seen anything cool?"
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And nobody could come up with anything else.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   >> Really?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> Yeah, it's pretty...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   >> It's often said, "It's often said, by Southwest,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   that the most interesting things are what's happening in the halls."
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> That's true, but I was in halls.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Nothing there either.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   >> I can't tell if I said what you just said.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Just say, "Hey, y'all, let's go eat."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   >> I guess Doc and I are pretty happy we stayed home, and will.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   >> I love going to Southwest, but you're right.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   It's a good conference started by great food and great entertainment.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   >> It's awesome.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I mean, the barbecue in Austin, if you've never been to Austin,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   forget to South by Southwest.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Go to Austin for the barbecue.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   >> I think we did the screensavers there once,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and we went out, I think it was called Stateline barbecue.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I think that was another one.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   >> A county line.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   >> A county line.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   >> I was a county line earlier this week, and it was amazing.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> They set a long table, because it was Patrick, me, Martin,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I mean, the whole gang, probably 20 of us, the whole production crew.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   They set a long table, they just said, "Sit down."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And they just started bringing plate after plate after plate,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and they kept calling.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> I used to actually wait tables at county line.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   >> Oh, really?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   >> Yeah, so I always go back just to have the bread.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   >> And then they took us back into the smoker,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   and my clothes still smell like pig.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   >> I'm not kidding.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That's like his potent.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   >> I mean, here's what the South by Southwest was like.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I was lying in the hallway.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I was lying down.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I actually had pictures up from Flickr, and I was talking to Ethan Zuckerman,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   the guy who started Global Voices Online, which is an awesome blog.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's not really a blog.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's more of an aggregator of blogs from all over the world.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   You can read what's happening in Zambia and Israel and Afghanistan,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   all over the place.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And he just had come home from the TED conference,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and he said that for the first time in years,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   he didn't feel like a rock star Ted.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That the green movement was getting all the heat.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I mean, John Doar, who was the VC of Google,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   was crying on stage about his daughter's admonition to him
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   to fix the global warming thing.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   >> That seems like a meme that has really hit its stride thanks to Al Gore.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Of course, Al Gore spoke at Ted last year.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Bill Clinton was there this year.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> It's like the Al Gore said there's no skiing.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Things like that.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   >> They're expanding now.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   The TED is now doing Ted Global, which is going to be another TED conference
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   in Arusha, Tanzania in early June.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   >> I'd love to go to Ted, but $6,000 on this.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> Yeah, too much money.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   >> The levels of cheaper is only $2,600.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   >> I think in many ways, South by Southwest really was the place to be rather than Ted.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   >> It's pretty amazing.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It's actually the first time.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   >> What's the next big conference?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   >> It's actually an unconference.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   It's no conference at all.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   >> Unconference.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   >> Yeah, I'm okay.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   We've had around the user-centric identity subject.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   We've had -- and there's a lot of technology development,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   but the biggest leaps forward that I've seen in technology have been
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   at unconferences.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   These are basically places, you know, events where people get together with a single purpose of
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   anybody who feels like it raises a subject and everybody breaks out into a table or a room.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   >> Kind of like a bar camp.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   >> It's like a bar camp, it's an example of one.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But bar camps are generally a general purpose.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And most unconferences that are really good, like the blogger cons that Dave Warner held,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   are -- you just see tectonic leaps forward, you know, one.0 to two.0 levels of geek progress
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   happening at those things.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   But there's no -- and you know, vendors don't run them, and big conference givers don't run them,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   and they don't have panels and they don't have -- you know, if they have power points,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   it's only to demonstrate something.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   They're amazing to me how well they work.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And if you're trying to get something done, they're great.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   If you just want to have the usual, you know, probably South by Southwest or some of the better ones of the remaining.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   >> I mean, I think that one -- definitely one of the things that I heard while I was down there.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I spoke on one small panel and then went to a couple of other panels.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And I think there was a lot of hunger for a lot more meat than what they were seeing at South by Southwest.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I mean, I think there was a lot of -- I mean, it was -- there was a lot of good stuff,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   but it was just a lot of talking about things, you know, you know, but not really getting to the --
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   to the heart of how to move things forward.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I think a lot of hope to get more information. That's what it seemed like for me, at least for the interactive conference.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> Can someone tell me -- I mean, the impression that I got from South by Southwest, like not being there,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   was that there was a lot of very talented people there.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I mean, the sort of the register of sort of, you know, Scobland, Zafrank and all these video bloggers that are big,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   but not a lot of people like with sort of old school, old money influence and cash.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And it seems like it should have been like a venture capitalist's dream conference, but it kind of wasn't.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   >> There were definitely some venture capitalists floating around in there.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I mean -- >> There were -- I met a venture capitalist from AOL and from a few others.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The VCs are hanging out in the -- I mean, they don't --
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   >> Aren't those the guys you want to keep out?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Don't you want to have the guys who are doing something about the money guys there?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   >> South by Southwest's power is that it's people who actually build websites, you know.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   A lot of web designers, a lot of web developers.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I mean, that's what I really like.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   That's who I really like meeting there.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I don't go there to meet the CEOs and the money, you know.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   >> One of the things that I thought was really interesting was the wide range.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   You'd end up with little bloggers that are doing, you know, little bloggers or little podcast creators that are talking about stuff.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   >> Like, how bloggers? >> Yeah, micro bloggers.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   But you also, in the same room, you'd have the head of interactive for Discovery Channel,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   the interactive guys from PBS.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And everyone is still digging through trying to figure this stuff out.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I also want to say that from a speaker's point of view is probably the best run conference I think I've ever been a part of.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   As far as like giving me enormous amounts of information as a speaker, I had a place I had to show up.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I had to do -- you know, I was a lot of these -- I was scheduled to be on a panel but had a bail at the last minute.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But I wasn't pressed up to the point where I bailed.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   How in contact they were.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   >> Really, really tightly run. And I speak at a lot of these things, because all of us do.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   >> Do you think that the problem with a conference like this is that stuff's just moving too fast?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   By the time you've put together a presentation on it, something new --
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I'll give you an example. Today, four hours ago, Twitter map went up.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Twitter vision went up, which is David Troy's live Ajax Google map mashup of Twitter map.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Now that just happened four hours ago and it's the rage right now and it's probably moving like a brush fire through the Twitter community.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And it'll be gone tomorrow or a road and a week.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I mean, how can you cover this kind of stuff at a conference?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   >> Well, I think that also there's a lot of pressure when you're putting together a panel that you want to have the names that are going to attract --
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   the names and the companies that are going to attract a lot of people to the panel.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And sometimes what you really want to hear from are the guys that are in the trenches going, "Okay, this is how we're actually putting this stuff together.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   They're not as impressive to see. They're not as impressive to -- you're not sure if that's a name that's going to drag people into a room of 500.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   But they're the ones that can really tell you how they're actually piecing this stuff together and making it all work.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And I think that sometimes that's a hard thing to kind of figure out.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   >> I have never been to South by Southwest. We've done coverage of it.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Amber was there last year.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And my sense of it was it had this great gathering of the tribes feeling last year.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   It was almost a hippie fest where people who are making a difference, who are doing interesting things, get together in a completely altruistic fashion.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's not particularly competitive.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Is that a mistake on my part? Was it like that last year? Was it like it this year?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   >> It really felt like that.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   >> Yeah, it was the last year.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   It had a little bit of that to me.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   But mostly it was gathering with -- mostly people I already knew and really like hanging out with.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And some people I like to meet and hang out with.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And a bunch of panels that are all the usual.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And it had the problem at all conferences, which is that panels are mainframes.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   They're old.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   They've got tail-based --
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   >> So is the unconference more of that kind of gathering of the tribe kind of thing?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   >> It's very practical.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   >> Interesting.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   >> I mean, there's fun to it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   But in the open source world, which is where -- which I cover, I can't say I really work there as much, but --
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   but which I cover, there's this saying, "Show me the code."
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You know, you're -- we could be as friendly as anything, but if you don't have the code, you don't really contribute.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   So there's this culture of contribution that really matters.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Now, the contribution is enough to be code.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   The contribution you could be standing at a white board and having some interesting things to say.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   But the inherently constructive rather than just instructive.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And that's sort of the big difference.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   The conferences of the old sort are instructive, but it's like school.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Like you said earlier, the topic like the Twitter thing can blow through like a brush fire, and that's inherently transitory.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It may be important, but it has too short a lifespan and too fast a movement to be treated in an instructive way.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And that's the model of the old conference.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It's school.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   You know, somebody's in the front of the room.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You sit still.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   You receive.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   They transmit.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   There's a curriculum.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   There's a whole -- you know, there's published works that have the whole syllabus in there.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And it's -- it's -- it's -- it's bold at this point.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I mean, it's really old-hand.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Yeah, but --
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   But the old school conferences are coming back with entertainment.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I'm not -- Kathy Sierra gave the keynote itself by Southwest.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And did a -- did a topic really wasn't that instructive.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I mean, I -- I didn't learn all that much that I could take home and really use, like a physics lecture.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But it was entertaining because of the imagery she used on stage and because I knew who she was.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Yeah, but that sounds like almost a waste of time then.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I mean --
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Well, it's not -- it's not -- it's not.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Actually, Bruce Sterling gave a closing talk last year.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   It was one of the most moving things I've ever heard in my life.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah, well, he's amazing.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I mean, anything he says I will listen to.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It's not though.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And even if it -- entertainment, it's about seeing people you know and you like and seeing them in a different context trying to do something for you.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   You know, I don't think that's a bad thing either to go and see Doc Serals give a keynote summer and listen to them.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And -- and yeah, you might not take away that much that you wouldn't have been able to learn on his blog or on his book -- in his books.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   But, you know, seeing him face to face and being able to get him to sign a book or something like that is a big thrill.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Hey, you mentioned -- I think that -- go ahead, Alex, and then I'm going to move on to the first one.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   One of the things that I think that would be really, really fun would be to see this kind of unconference, which I admit -- like I did the unconference at Pittsburgh, you know, for podcasting.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   But seeing something like mixed with some of these big conferences as a kind of a happening at the same time to give you that kind of --
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Well, it's kind of how the birds of feather meetings usually are like, yeah, six.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And I think that that would be an -- I start to mix those two together.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Well, tell us what said -- was there a bar camp going on at the same time?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   South by Southwest had a bar camp.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Yeah, the -- the bar camp was --
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And the music is really good too, by the way.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Well, that's -- Robert, did you get to the bar camp there?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I mean, in one corner was Matt Mullen-Wig, who started, you know, WordPress giving a little talk to 15 people, and in another part, Microsoft was giving a little talk about expression.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And another part of the bar was, I don't know, Chris and Cena talking about something I didn't even hear about.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   See, I'd love to be at something like that.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Forget the rest of the conference. That's what I'd like to do.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   That's what my men regret not going there was actually missing the bar camp.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Pretty amazing.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Which is great last year.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So one of the -- And they had free -- they had free burritos, which were awesome.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   You back to the food.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Robert, I worry about your --
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'm sorry, Robert.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Last time I saw Doc, he was on Atkins.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You're still on the Atkins?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Is it working for you?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Well, I lost 25 pounds and I found another 30.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   That's a way of doing that, doesn't it?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Yeah, that's a way of doing it.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   You know, and probably something to do with it.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   You know, it's a movement, man.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   It's a little hard-looking.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So somebody mentioned Zae Frank, and I guess Zae Frank presented both at Ted and South by Southwest, but he's retiring.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   What's going on with Zae?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   He's closing down his video blog.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   A year-long show and his last show was yesterday.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   So you can go to ZaeFrank.com and see his last show.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And he told me that he's going to take a little bit of time off to fix his website and do some projects that he's been sort of holding off on.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And then we'll see whether he comes back.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I'm sure he's going to come back with more content.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Well, I applaud him.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think that's --
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Yeah, but I mean, he'd do in a daily show is tough.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   He was consistently creative, funny, clever.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I'm amazed he was able to do it as long as he was, and I applaud him for saying, "Hey, I'm done now.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I'm going to move on to something else."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   He was the best thing off TV, I thought.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   I agree.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I think he might have been the best thing including what's on TV.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And I don't know how he did it without blinking.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Maybe he just wanted some time off to blink.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Well, it is.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   [laughter]
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   He doesn't blink very much, even when you meet him in person.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   [laughter]
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's interesting.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So that's very interesting.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Anyway --
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   You wrote me an email one time and said, "Blinking is for pussies."
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   That's his slogan.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Well, go see -- I mean, the good news is there's a large body of work there that if you haven't
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   seen it, you have a chance to see it.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   If you have, you can see it again.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   You're actually -- I was a late-late-laitcomer to the whole movement of "Zayfran" and it was just such great stuff.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And I agree with you.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   It's just so hard to believe that someone could do that shit every day after day.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   The show on the 13th, by the way, is really one that you should watch.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And he's not even on it.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He asked his reader or his listeners or viewers or whatever they call them to send him a video of their own.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And he got a thousand videos and he put the best ones up.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And I think it's like 20 minutes.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I forget how long it is.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It's a pretty long video.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   But it's just --
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   It's 34 minutes.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's viewers.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   It's probably the best video I've seen on the Internet.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And it's all normal people saying what "Zay" meant to him over the last year.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   He encouraged -- it was really encouraging to see him because he kind of lived up to that notion that the net should be doing something different.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Not just another TV show, not just another radio show or newspaper article.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It should be something new and different.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And he really -- he kind of made that happen.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Moving on to the biggest story of the week.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Viacom.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Sue's Google.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Pulls a little Dr. Evil for $1 BILLION.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   They claim 150,000 copyright violations.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   They claim a lot of money made by YouTube -- and of course by its parent company -- Google on these copyright violations.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And they say we want our share.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   What does this mean?
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Doc Serles, why don't you kick it off?
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Oh boy.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I've actually sort of avoided the topic because the way you see it is a company like Viacom, which is an entertainment company.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   It's Hollywood, essentially.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Employees' entire buildings full of lawyers that do nothing but things like clearing rights for everything.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   And I can't imagine that any industry has driven by their legal departments as the entertainment one is could stand silver very long while pockets as deep as they are.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And pockets as deep as Google's were walking around owning what they would see as copyright violators.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   That's sort of the public side of it.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   The private side of it is the same as whatever was that happened between Cisco and Apple over the, you know, the iPhone name.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   They'll work it out in private, whatever it is.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's a negotiating ploy.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   To me it's almost a -- it serves as a kind of smokescreen for what really matters, which is the absolute need for copyright reform, which won't happen until the geeks get behind making something happen and become as strong a lobbying force as Hollywood is right now.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   A couple of different point of views from PC Magazine editor Lance Ulanoff said Viacom's making a big mistake.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   They could destroy perhaps the best publicity vehicle Viacom ever saw in YouTube.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Jim Lauterback disagrees and says that in fact Viacom's lawsuit was not only necessary.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   He does agree in the one respect that it could be very bad for YouTube.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Actually, I guess Lance believes that YouTube will survive.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I don't think it's bad for YouTube.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I don't think it's bad for Viacom either.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Viacom had to protect its existing business model.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   But YouTube, the magic of YouTube, it's go back to that Z-Frank video that played on the 13th of this month, where he had a thousand people write a video in their videos.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   That's where the opportunity is.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   I think they built a box around their business model, and that's fine.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   They're going to get the billion dollars.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Google can afford it.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Google has gone up many times since they buy it.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Here's the larger fear, though, is that a court is going to make...
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   This is what Mark Cuban says.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Is Google protected by this safe harbor, which is intended to protect internet service providers and web hosting companies, or is YouTube really a media company, which Viacom claims?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   If a judge decides YouTube is a media company and is responsible for protecting and finding copyright violations, doesn't that cause a big problem, not just for YouTube, but for this whole...
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   industry?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Well, a lot of people have compared it to the old Napster Snaro, which is where Google is basically saying what Napster said, which is, "Well, we just provide a service, and people can put legit stuff on it, but if people put illegal stuff on it, that's not really our fault. We're just hosting the service."
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And, of course, I think the Napster and the Nutella and all those kind of guys fell on the sword on that one.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I don't know why Google is going to be any different.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   There's a lot of PR danger for Viacom being given the kind of content, a lot of the kind of content that they do with Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, so on and so forth, of looking extremely uncool.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And the problem is that their business is based on looking cool, and they have now just smacked a large number of their viewers are now being, you know, watching something that they spend a lot of time watching, getting smacked on the head.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And I think that that can be, you know, very, I think overall it can be dangerous for them in that area.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Lance brings up some interesting stats. He says, "Radings for CBS," which is a Viacom properties, "Late Night Shows have gone up, and he believes, and I think he can make a good case that it's because of these clips on YouTube.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I'd never even heard of Craig Ferguson until I saw him on the Late Late Show on YouTube.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   That show is up 7%. The Late Show, they were letting them up 5%.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Absolutely, and you've got to remember the influentials in the industry are on the internet.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And so if they see something cool on YouTube getting popular, they're going to write about it and talk about it and tell their friends and blog about it and Twitter about it.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And, you know, I am about it and I email about it.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And because Viacom has decided to pull everything off of YouTube and therefore put a chilling effect across the entire industry, they're not going to get talked about anymore.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I'm going to watch, say, Frank rather than watch a Viacom video.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Well, this is what you've been saying, Alex, all along about the record industry, that by clamping down, for instance, as they are now on internet radio, all they're doing is hurting themselves by forcing people to turn independent artists.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Well, and I think that also this really opens up a lot. We've talked about it this little on this week in media of if they really push this down the path and they really force the courts to make a decision.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And the courts vote, for instance, go against YouTube. One of the things that happens is that it's very, very hard to get the copy written material out there except for what they think is the best way.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   But the problem is, is that this, what people are going to go, might go towards, especially as we see this huge competition between Apple TV, Xbox, PS3, Juice, all these other companies, what you may start seeing is a lot more content that is not controlled that way, being able, but easier to find.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Easier to get to and getting to a point where it's almost just as good.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And that might be enough for people to just stop watching some of the copy written stuff. They could be slowly killing off their market.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That's all.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I would add that what happened with internet radio was the most recent event in the history of copyright, lawmaking that began with, even before the DMCA, with the 1996,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   with a variety of things happening in '96. In any case, it was a decision made by the copyright royalty barber.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Nobody even knew existed until last, a couple of weeks ago, when the decision came down.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   You wrote a blog post on Linux Journal, which I thought was really right on, internet radio on death row.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Right now, it's a death sentence. The way people think Hollywood doesn't get the net, in the sense of fear that you get it in an enormous way, they got it early on.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And they saw that what was going to happen with the net was that it was going to eat all of media as it was known.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And what they wanted to do, if it was radio came along, what's radio happened on the net, they wanted to deal with radio.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That would be much better than the deal they got with radio in the 1930s when only composers were compensated through EMI and CSAC and BMI.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And the performers were left out. So they went out of their way to have radio, internet radio, defined, not as radio, but as a performance like you might find at a club.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   And created a bunch of law making that basically said, "This is for admission only, and it's going to be something we'll define as well."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   You know, anybody who listens to these, what they call, perfect reproductions. It was digital. It was perfect, even if it was only 24k.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   That anybody who listened would have to pay, and that would be the business model.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   They decided what the business model would be in 1996. That passed in the fall of '98.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   But because they left it open to negotiation between webcasters, which barely existed in '98, but it actually gotten pretty well underway by 2001,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   they kept it up to negotiations between those parties. But the webcasters were very weak lobbying-wise, and they were very weak lawyer-wise, and they got pretty much clobbered.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And then they were saved only by Jesse Helms at the last minute on the behest of the religious broadcasters, who wanted the nonprofits to remain protected.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And NPR and non-commercial stations were to some degree protected by a separate carve-out. It was called. It was very harsh and secret.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And that deal got revealed by the royalty board in their decision like three Fridays ago.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And now, of course, NPR is suddenly in the same bucket as all of these little webcasters that are kicking around out there.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And they kind of saw that coming. They were out at NPR a few weeks ago, and they were kind of looking forward to something bad happening there.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Nobody expected it to be as bad as it was. But it is a death sentence. It basically says, "Your business model is excellent. It's going to be too expensive."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And I said in that piece, it recalled the vogons' decision to wipe out the earth and to put the notice on Alpha Centauri and blame the earthlings for not picking up on it.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's a ludicrous thing, but there it is. I'm hoping that some of the geekfully had crazy about it and helped wipe out that legislation.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Saveourinternetradio.com seems to be the locus for a lot of this conversation. Saveourinternetradio.com.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   It's one-house with Pauling.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   I think that artists, though, can start really thinking about whether this is the kind of people they want representing their music.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And more and more artists are going more independent, and they can make decisions about where their music ends up.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I know we've been looking at doing some podcasts that are geared around independent labels and independent music.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And we've had no problem. When we call the record labels directly, the ones that are not part of the RIAA,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   and make requests based on that, and if it's not covered under some of those pieces, we're able to use that music.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And we're able to do those pieces. Now, how long will it take for that to become organized and large enough to be useful?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I don't know. But if it keeps on going down this path, and it's hard to listen to it on a radio that we don't listen to anymore,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I mean, every car I get into now, I rent a lot of cars, and every car I get into now has an eighth-inch jack.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And I don't listen to the radio anymore. I mean, I plug my iPod in, I go back to whatever I was doing,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   and I don't have any reality of listening to the radio at this point.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So I think that there's, once again, this could be another example of the industry cut and its nose off despite its face.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   In other words, you see this as an opportunity for the independent artist.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It's a huge opportunity, because if the independent labels and the independent artists sees on the fact that the large labels
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   are cutting themselves out of the system and find ways to make it easier for these companies to get a hold of their music,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   through their music, so on and so forth, I think that they can make big inroads into a market that's just about to become more and more open.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And I think that's where YouTube is going. If YouTube can't show off the VICOM content, what are they going to show off?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And there's still a huge audience checking out YouTube every morning.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   They're going to show off Zay Frank and all the new kids are showing off little home videos.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Well, I think we're going to see you.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   There's a lot of people who are going to absolutely.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I think we're going to see YouTube getting very organized about producing new content that's on YouTube that is well produced and designed and so on and so forth.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   I mean, there's a lot of rumblings going on about that.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And so, you know, right now they've got this huge audience and hopefully they'll make the turn faster than Napster made, which is Napster didn't make the turn fast enough.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And hopefully if they get to a legitimate new content available on YouTube, they could cause a lot of damage.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Well, as I remember what happened in Napster is that the judge required them to put in a technology that would capture copyright and material and keep it off their network.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And they couldn't do it and they had to go on a business.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Napster was a single point that could be attacked.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   To me, the interesting thing that happened after Napster was the open protocol allowed anybody to share with anybody and made it impossible to stamp that kind of stuff out.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I mean, do all of you use BitTorrent by any chance?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   We would admit it.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Yes, of course we do.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I mean, one of the things I said at the public broadcasting conference a few weeks ago was, you know, at some point, you know, the PBS could just put front line, make that the alpha seed on BitTorrent and why even a transmitters anymore.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I mean, it's, well, you know, we push on these podcasts on Twitter, we push 44 terabytes a month, which I just recently found out we were fortunate because we get that donated by AOL and cashflow.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Very fortunate.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Yeah, very fortunate because AOL just told me if you were paying for this, it'd be over 40 grand a month.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Wow.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   We couldn't do it, but when we first started because we didn't have those relationships, we used BitTorrent.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And while it was, it's not ideal because it's difficult to use, you can't just click a link and so forth.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   It certainly is, would it be the solution if we lost our partnerships?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   You bet.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   But then it just to bring it back round to where we started.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I mean, YouTube really is a single point of failure.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And if a judge comes in and says, look, install the filtering or, you know, you're in, you're in total breach and they can't install the filtering, we're back to the map to situation.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Yeah, but wait, wait, wait.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   How many companies are out there that are Viacom 5 or 6?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So now we're talking about $6 billion.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Google can survive a $6 billion round of lawsuits and they'll come out.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   So do you think they'll settle?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   How much money is going to be spent in the next decade or two on advertising on this thing?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Will they come forward and settle?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And then because they don't want the judge to make any decision about whether they're an ISP or a media company?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I don't think they'll settle.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I think they're going to go all the way.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   They'll fight.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   I think the risks are mitigated already.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   They've already made their money off of this thing.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   They've already gotten a brand love that YouTube brought them.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   They've already gotten the equity out of it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   They're going to go all the way with this thing.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And meanwhile, Chad Hurley's going, whoo.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Yeah, I'm kidding.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   That was close.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   That he wouldn't have sued Chad Hurley, but they'll sue Google because Chad didn't have the pockets.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   But look at what's going to happen in the next two years between now and the end of this lawsuit.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   200 or 300 million people are going to get video cameras on their new cell phones.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Are we going to not see another Zayf rank out of the next two years?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   We're going to see like 50 million Zayf ranks.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Well, it's kind of the same point that Alex has been making, which is that this is merely, in music or in video,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   it's just an opportunity for the independent.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And if you're currently not independent, you might want to start thinking about being independent.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   And I can just say, note to that, I have been meeting with a variety of artists that are pretty well known in Hollywood,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   you know, talking about, you know, they're trying to figure out what they're going to do,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and they don't really have a whole lot of interest in working with Hollywood anymore.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   They can smell blood.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   I mean, they can see-- If you're a Robert Rodriguez, you're not going to make another Hollywood picture.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Why Bob?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I mean, it was--
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   No, I was sitting--
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I'm probably not out.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I was sitting up Robert Rodriguez's table at the Austin Films Society, and he's totally--
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I mean, his crew is totally into this stuff, and his crew is totally into disrupting Hollywood.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   I mean, that's what he's been doing.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Robert Rodriguez, for those who don't know, is the guy who did the Spy Kids films and other films.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And he's doing it for, you know, a fraction of the cost of an average Hollywood show.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   He gets stars to come on his shows because he takes them only for a week instead of a month or two months.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   He's just-- he's a brilliant guy.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Everybody should pay attention to him a lot more.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And by the way, the biggest cost is always the stars.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   It's really the legal department, and it's having to deal with the big old corporate interest.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   If you can work your way around that, you're better off.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I want to remind our listeners on TalkShoe.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   We are streaming this live at talkshoe.com that we will be taking calls in just a few minutes.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   So if you call in and get on the queue, if you have a question about any of the topics we've talked about,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   you have a chance to talk with Doc Surles, who is with us, Robert Scobel, Alex Lindsey, and Will Harris.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   This is the first time we've done this on Twitter, and it's kind of an experiment.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   By the way, Leo, I got an I.M. from a friend in Scotland who says, "Tell Leo to stop being so funny
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and Mac break weekly as I keep laughing out loud while listening on my iPod."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   He must like my Shrek invitation.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   That's what he likes.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I guess.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   A podcast is lacking onion.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   So any other big stories we want to get to before we go to the calls, anything else happened this week
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   that any of you think is worth bringing up?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Well, this week was Seabit in Germany, which is one of the biggest tech conferences in the world
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   if you're kind of equipment manufacturer.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   It's a huge event.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Absolutely massive.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   I mean, it's to walk from one side to the other.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   You're talking some serious mileage.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Did you go well?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I didn't, but I had a bunch of guys that went out to cover it.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   There was a few and a couple of interesting things there.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   There weren't many big announcements.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I think we were expecting both ATI and NVIDIA to come out with new graphics cards and neither
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   of them did because they're all delayed.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But we did see the return of Commodore.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I was going to say the Commodore game.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   If you guys remember the C64, they're back with a new line of sort of elite gaming PCs.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Now, before you get all excited, this is no more Commodore than Packard Bell was the radio company, right?
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I mean, this is absolutely.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   This is a company that bought the Commodore name a couple of years ago.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   But they're trading pretty heavily on the history and they're saying, you know, these things could be, you know, collectors history
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   and they've got the big Commodore logo on the side.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And it's like, and you get a Commodore 64 emulator.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Well, there you go.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   That's all I need.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I'm going to use my dual SLI cards to run chopper command.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   C64, right?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Excited, yeah.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   So these were pretty heavy duty machines that looked like according to the specs.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Yeah, and they got some nice artwork on the side.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   It looks all fancy and modded and, you know, whatever.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   If the C64 was known because it had 64K of RAM, will the new Commodore have 64 gigs of RAM?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   I think they got about two.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Stand it.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   All right.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Samsung is going to start shipping hybrid hard drives.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   We mentioned that.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Oh, actually from BitTech.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   But now we've seen an announcement of a 32 gigabyte all solid state hard drive from Sandisk.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   32 gigabytes.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Interesting.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Can you say MacBook Lite?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   It'll be an S-A-T-A.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Do you think Apple will adopt it?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Well, that's the rumor, isn't it?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   The rumor around the Mac rumor bill, I guess someone used that table that you had last
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   week wrote to make a new rumor.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And then it's going to be a MacBook, you know, kind of mini, mini-lite thing with all
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   flash storage.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   It sounded like, go ahead, Alex.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I would say it sounded like Apple.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   One of the rumors was connected to Apple being able to put a, your startup, basically a lot
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   of the flash drives so that your startup is almost instant.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   So it still has a regular hard drive, but it also has flash memory that it can go back
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   to.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   So it sounds like the Vista ready drive.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Something like that.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Have you seen that TechCrunch has made a big announcement about its business?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   There's a new CEO.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   What does that mean?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I don't understand what that means.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It means that they're going to start going and acquiring companies soon because that's
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   what she does.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   How could Errington have that much money?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I don't understand.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.600]   He's going to get fine.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.000]   I think in the next month he's going to announce that he's going to get, he's getting under
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   it.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.720]   But then you've got to say, well, wait a minute, TechCrunch has known for covering Web 2.0
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   companies.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   Now their business model is we'll cover Web 2.0 companies and we'll buy them?
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.640]   I think it's bigger than that.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   But yes.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   I think it's bigger than that.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.240]   Well, how can you trust them anymore in their coverage?
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.640]   I don't think they're going to buy Web 2 companies.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.720]   I think they're going to buy other media companies.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.520]   The opportunity for media right now is really interesting.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:46.080]   Why couldn't they buy something like Blahther, for instance, and get a whole other thing
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   gone?
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.600]   Or why couldn't they buy a parenting website like Maya's mom or something like that?
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.640]   You have any insight into this, Doc?
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.040]   Not really.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.160]   It makes sense to me and I'm not even sure if I can tell you how.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:07.840]   I guess if you look at TechCrunch's as a mechanism for having a really good finger on
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:14.320]   a pulse and if you assume that people are not going to trust that finger and that pulse
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.880]   less just because they're busy acquiring companies.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.720]   Well, I will.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.040]   Yeah, well, you may be more discriminating than the average bear.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.200]   I think that that really muddies the waters.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   What are they?
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   Are they journalists?
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.680]   But then every media company has that dichotomy.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.280]   I mean, every journalist working for a magazine has had a cut.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.280]   No, it has.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   It has a cut.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.720]   Yeah, but I think the only thing they're hoping is that Harry and Tennessee are the
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   children.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.720]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   That's true.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.240]   So Mike is just going to be the journalist and Heather is going to get on with the business
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.400]   of business, really.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   Tell us about Heather.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   What?
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.840]   Well, she used to be, well, according to the post, merges and acquisitions are Fox.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.160]   So bought a whole bunch of stuff into Fox Interactive.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   So big media.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.160]   Didn't she buy MySpace?
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.360]   Wasn't she on the team that brought MySpace into Fox?
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.280]   Yeah, and I think she then led on a whole bunch of stuff after Ross Lemons had left.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.880]   Well, how big of a war chest could Mike have?
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.640]   As big as what was fun.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   It's fun, dude.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   Yeah, that depends who funds him.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.560]   I mean, you know, I guess if I'm a VC and I'm looking for somebody who's got his finger
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.000]   on what's going to be the next big thing, I would go to Mike Harrington and say, all
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.440]   right, Mike, here's a billion dollars.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.600]   Buy me the next MySpace.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.800]   And I think he does.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.080]   And, you know, when I was over in Germany, what did we talk about it?
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.440]   Drink and beer in Germany.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   It was toxic.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.040]   It was a tech crunch.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   It was not Twitter.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   It was tech crunch.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   We had a little bit of beer.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.640]   We was talking about tech crunch.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.440]   What's wrong with that?
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   All right.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   Twitter was stuff by Southwest.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:54.120]   But everybody, you know, everybody, a lot of people watch tech crunch and I think Mike
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.120]   has something going.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:00.840]   And I think if, you know, you look at Podshow, our Podtext competitors, they got 15 million,
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.200]   or actually they got 23 million dollars so far.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.320]   You know, Mike could get easily 20 million dollars and start acquiring some interesting
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.920]   companies and doing some interesting things.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.520]   So Heather Hard joins, or Hardy, I'm not sure how she pronounces, joins them at the end
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   of the month and how long before we see the first announcement?
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.120]   I don't know.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   30 days.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   Pretty quick.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.440]   I put a sweepstakes on it.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.440]   Pretty quick.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   And who do you think it'd be?
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.040]   Will it be Facebook, Twitter?
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   Who will?
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.200]   Odeos for sale?
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.040]   Dig maybe?
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.920]   You know, dig, I have to say, Mike's been very friendly all along with dig.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   In fact, he was the one who said dig out a Sue Cinek.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.240]   No, I don't think he's buying any kind of company.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.280]   I think Doc has got it right.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.600]   It's all, you know, it's about media companies.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   It's about buying up.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.600]   Well, I think the new media companies.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:59.040]   And making a, and making a kind of blog network kind of thing of top blogs.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.640]   How much to a by-pot tech, Robert?
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   I don't know.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   Let's talk off of it.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.240]   What do you got?
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.720]   I am not hiring a CEO.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   I'll tell you that.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   Let's go to the phones now.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.440]   This is again something we've never tried before.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.800]   We're going to try it right now.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.240]   If you're in the queue, just hang in there.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.520]   I'm going to make sure I've got all the buttons pushed right.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.520]   I'm going to make sure that everybody can hear you.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.200]   I mean, Jason Calcansa earlier was saying tech punch will buy CNET in two years.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   And let Veronica run it.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.440]   I don't think I think what Jason was saying, which is, we should ask Jason.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.080]   That would be really smart, you know.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.600]   Jason's on the talk, talk cast.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   Is Jason in here?
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   He's going crazy.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   Yeah, he's listening.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.080]   I didn't see him.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   All right.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.400]   I've seen him on Twitter vision a couple times.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   Hey, Jason.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   He's, Jason, are you there?
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   Hey, guys.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   Oh boy, he's barely audible.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   Wait a minute, that's my fault.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.880]   I got to twist some buttons.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.880]   Jason knows about this.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.240]   He has a studio now for the Calcans cast.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   Hello, Jason.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   Hey, guys.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   How you doing?
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   Hey, Jason.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.920]   So I can feel you went on the Mike Arrington stuff.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.280]   He's not going to buy web 2.0 companies.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.840]   I mean, he's obviously growing his media business.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.560]   And obviously, I'm partners with him on the tech crunch 20 conference.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.040]   So, you know, I've known about the Heather Bing for a while.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.840]   She's just a great operation CEO type person who's going to be able to let him focus on
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   in a tutorial.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.880]   Old media or no media?
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.320]   Well, obviously new media.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.760]   I mean, the conference is obviously old media.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.280]   Now your fire comes a great price right now.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.760]   I don't think it's going to be going for a fire coming back that.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:42.120]   But I will tell you guys that I checked on my T-Mobile account today and I went 2300 messages
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.960]   over and I now $236 in one week on Twitter.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.600]   And it's all Twitter, isn't it?
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   I'm destroyed.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   I can't believe you were watching.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.160]   You were using SMS on Twitter.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.360]   I turned that off right away.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.720]   I thought, my God, I mean, my phone was buzzing constantly.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.920]   I have the same problem that now I think Scobl has, which is so many people are adding
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.800]   me that there's no easy way to befriend them back.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.560]   So it takes like an hour to do 100 people and the servers are slow.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.560]   Well, no wonder you got some of these messages.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   You're befriending everybody who adds you?
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.560]   I'm calling.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.840]   That would be the right thing to do.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   No, it isn't.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   That's insane.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.720]   It's not of saying that actually it's awesome.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.920]   It's such a fire hose of early adopters.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   It's too much of a fire hose.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   Oh my God, it's awesome.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:32.280]   No, I have almost 2700 people following me.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.920]   I'm not going to have 2700 friends.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.440]   That's almost 2800 friends.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.680]   I have 68 friends.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.680]   That's how many friends.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.280]   No wonder your bill is so high.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.760]   I have 1000 friends right now, 1043.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.560]   I have 300 friends.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.920]   I have 100 followers.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.320]   Are you getting constant Twitters?
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320]   What is the deal?
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.320]   Absolutely.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   It's awesome.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   I mean, I'm seeing 1000 people.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   You guys are junkies.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:58.520]   My wife, I got an appointment last night over it.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.400]   She's like, you have to put that down.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.680]   We're having dinner like what is going on on your blackberry.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.840]   I was like, it's Scobl.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.240]   This person is a bad person.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   I turned off.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.240]   Have you seen?
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.040]   I actually, John Edwards, campaign guy, you know, John Edwards, right?
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:22.360]   For president, his campaign guy said I was pulling this blackberry.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   You what?
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   Filling up his blackberry.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.880]   Yeah, I actually was about ready to stop watching you at South by Southwest Robert because
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.400]   I was just getting so sick of it.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.640]   It was like, I don't want to know anymore about the show I am not at.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.200]   It's basically a never ending chat room now.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:41.080]   It's like, we're just all in a chat room for 24 hours a day and like the last thing I
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.200]   was doing before I go to bed is say good night and then wake up in the morning, fail out
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.960]   of Scobl, Dave Warner is drinking his coffee.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.160]   I mean, it's CB radio for Web 2.0 without the static.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.320]   Isn't that just ILC?
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   Just a bunch of fairies.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   That's good.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   Actually, it's not IRC.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:01.640]   It's IRC without the idiots because if somebody turns idiotic, I unfriend them immediately and
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   they're gone.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.160]   It's not like when I ran Leo LaPortz chat room.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.720]   But you're not supposed to have back and forth conversations, are you?
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.480]   I mean, that kind of defeats the whole purpose of Twitter.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.880]   Well, now you're sounding like Terry, huh?
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.880]   Well, it's a...
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   Yeah, I did it.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   Well, it's a bit of what you're doing.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.440]   I guess if what you're doing is having a conversation with some of the people.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.200]   Jason did a very interesting thing today.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   Tell us about your experiment.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.800]   I basically was watching the Nick game and there's a lot of breaks where I said, okay,
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.840]   I'm going to ask Jason, ask me any question.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.760]   And I got 30 questions in 10 minutes.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.960]   I started answering them.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:43.320]   And then Jason Shelyn, who was partners with EV and those guys on Blogger before they did
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.160]   Twitter, was like, that's it.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   I'm done.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   I'm leaving Calicana.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   There's too much, you know, and it was pretty funny.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.920]   But it definitely is like...
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.640]   I'm moving conference or something like that.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   It's weird.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.520]   I'm sure it's tongue in cheek, but you're talking about monetizing it, Jason.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.920]   That's when I started going, wait a minute.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.720]   Well, you guys think I'm joking.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:10.760]   I think you guys should go check the internet for who owns auto Twitter, gadget Twitter,
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   parenting Twitter.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.960]   I'm not about 100 Twitter names.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   That's it.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.720]   I'm announcing right now I'm leaving Twitter for all the people who I'm not using Twitter
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   anymore.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   Let's see, it's all over.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   Forget it.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.720]   Jason, I...
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   I'm starting an hour in the Twitter blog.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.480]   Actually, you know, two weeks ago, I said, who wants to meet at South by South by South
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   West for dinner in?
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.640]   Within two minutes, I had 30 people.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.840]   And we had a good dinner at the South.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.280]   I think there's something to be said for that.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.360]   And I think that's kind of neat, this kind of locational Twittering.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   And I announced that I'm doing a beach party on June 16th on Twitter.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.840]   And already I have people from all over the world saying they're coming.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   Well, who's buying...
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.760]   Well, Jason, aren't you buying a dinner if you...
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.480]   Oh, you lost the poker merch tournament, though.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   That's...
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   I came in sixth place last night.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.040]   If I won, I was going to buy everybody's sushi.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:00.640]   But somebody told me on Twitter that Jeff Polver is a big poker player, and then he's
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   going to kick my butt.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.840]   So I said, "Okay, fine, I'll play him anytime, anywhere, any amount of money.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   Heads up, poker."
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.120]   So I think we have some betting going on on Twitter.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.640]   And I saw Polver now wants to put a big Twitter screen up at Vaughn, so that...
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   Which I think is a great idea for a conference.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.120]   I had to leave Jeff Polver's thing because he was basically talking about his podcasting
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.240]   company like 20 times a day.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.560]   And it's like the etiquette for Twitter.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.440]   You don't need to tell everybody every blog post you're doing on your Twitter, you know?
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.400]   Well, it's interesting because there's definitely disagreement about what is acceptable on Twitter
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   and what isn't.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.080]   And I'm sure I violate all the time.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   It's rarely...
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   I mean, there's no rules.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   Who knows what the rules are.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   You know, we're going to stop that.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   But anyway, great job.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.640]   And I love this talk-shoe thing.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.200]   I'll get off so you can take another crawler.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   Thank you.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   It's great to talk to you, Jason.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   I really appreciate it.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.720]   The rules are you carry out whatever you want in 140 characters, though.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.520]   As long as it fits in 140 characters.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.520]   That's the rule.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   Avila Feynman.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.320]   You can do it on a rubbish.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.320]   140 characters.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.720]   You know, we're going to be able to host for...
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   We're doing this...
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   Hello.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   It's a drink show.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   Hold on a second.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   Alex wants to talk about his mixed drink show.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.720]   Go ahead.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.720]   No, no, we're doing it.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.920]   We're doing the show on mixed drinks for network.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   And it was really funny.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.080]   I was trying to explain to the host that she might want to think about being Twitter and
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.840]   trying to explain to someone who's not as techy when Twitter.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.840]   Like you can't.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.720]   So you tell people about where you are and what you're doing.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.320]   And she's like, "And why would you do that?"
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.240]   And I tried to explain it on the radio show.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   How would I do that?
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.200]   I just do the explanation and I realize this is not working.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.800]   Which is funny because she sends me, you know, I get like four or five text messages from
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   her day.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   You know what?
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:34.080]   I think now if you show somebody Twitter vision.com, just show them that page.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.240]   Just say go to Twitter vision.com and say no more.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.800]   I think that'll get the job done.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   There we go.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   Avila Feynman.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   Go ahead.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   Hi, how you doing tonight?
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   Very well.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   Welcome.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Andy from Phoenix again.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   Hi, are you?
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   Hi, Andy.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   Andy, Andy, you must actually live on Talk Shoe.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   No, I just find you.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   I find you.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   I find you.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   I find you.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   I'm your software.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.840]   Which is very easy with Twitter.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   Twitter makes it easy.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   You know my exact location.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:06.240]   In fact, I accidentally put my longitude and latitude to to great a precision and people
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   knew where my home is.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.080]   We've seen your house before on the frankly thing.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.640]   Remember that thing you take?
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   That's my old house.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.640]   I moved after that.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   That's scary.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   If you finally have a house, my son's house is like two blocks down.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   Shh.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.520]   So, Andy, what's your question for our panel?
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.760]   Well, I wanted to talk to the school.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.400]   I know you worked at Microsoft for a little bit.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.680]   Did you hear about the convention that would happen this week?
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.760]   In San Diego?
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.680]   A Microsoft convention?
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   No, convention.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.000]   I don't know what you're saying.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Say it again.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   It's a convention.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.160]   It was in San Diego.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.320]   It was Steve Bomber's press conference earlier in the week.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.560]   Nobody at Microsoft pays any attention to Steve Bomber, do they?
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.120]   No, it's a couple.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   Come on.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   You're not there anymore.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   You can tell the truth.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.280]   Isn't bomber a joke?
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.600]   Is that where they talked about the new CRM stuff and all that?
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   I put them on hold.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   Yes, the MVP Summit.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   You wrote the whole...
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.840]   No, no, MVP Summit was up in Redmond.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.640]   The other one was talking about SharePoint and Enterprise.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.320]   Is Microsoft really...
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.800]   Look at what we've been talking about lately.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.280]   Is Microsoft even really an important player anymore?
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.040]   Yes, you know why?
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.240]   Because they have $60 billion in the bank and they can buy something.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.360]   Didn't they buy something this week that was previously in Tellyo?
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.480]   Yes, they buy stuff and it disappears.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.200]   It sinks under the waves.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.160]   Yes, it's not true.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.160]   They have to...
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.880]   It could be important and irrelevant at the same time.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   Yes, actually that's true.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.240]   And they do have 95% of all the desktops.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.160]   They just don't seem to know what to do with it.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.160]   Maybe the Josh...
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.560]   I think they're not doing well with the bleeding edge.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.920]   They're doing very well with serving their existing customers.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.760]   But live is such a failure.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   Actually, it was...
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.720]   I love their maps, by the way.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.720]   I do too.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   They have some...
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   And look live.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   There's some great stuff on live.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   It's a failure.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.080]   Has it started yet?
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   I rest my case.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   Robert, I can't...
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   I don't know.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   I rest my case.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.120]   I'm about 85% promised.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   That's still the case, Robert.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:24.360]   You had a wonderful roster of things that weren't done over and over again.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   Over and over again.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   It's quite amazing.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   It's amazing.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:33.640]   So many smart people are leaving Microsoft and I just hear a lot of frustration from
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.000]   inside Microsoft that they can't ship stuff.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.200]   Get more on Mike, Robert, because you're kind of fading away in the distance.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   There you go.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.680]   Can you hear me now?
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.680]   You're just...
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.680]   You sound like you're...
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.680]   You're just...
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   Yeah, right.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.680]   No, that's Verizon.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   But anyway, go ahead.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   Verizon, right.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.200]   You know, there's just a lot of frustration coming from inside Microsoft.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.720]   I mean, there are parts of Microsoft that are clicking pretty well.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.680]   The Xbox team is doing fairly well.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.200]   The business side of Microsoft, you know, the CRM, which is what the caller was talking
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.400]   about, is doing very well.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.600]   You know, they own business.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:15.160]   And nobody is going to sell that part of Microsoft for a long time, no matter what Google tries
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   to do.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.160]   Good point.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   Good point.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.480]   Yeah, Google might move into their turf, you know, over the next five years.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.440]   But I just don't see them being in saleable on the business side.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.120]   The thing I follow is the internet and the consumer space.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.960]   And they're really struggling to get traction.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.480]   Maybe that's it, is that we're much more interested in what's going on in the consumer.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   I am, anyway.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   Much more interested going on the consumer.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   I am.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.480]   I am interested in SQL Server.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.880]   I mean, SQL Server makes billions of dollars for Microsoft.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.880]   And exchange, you know, which is real important, makes billions of dollars and is really attractive.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:55.360]   Even continued for even our startup is looking at exchange instead of Google's email server.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.320]   But you know, the stuff that's really attractive to me is the consumer side stuff and the website
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   stuff.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.440]   And there, Microsoft really has not had a good strategy going.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.460]   I mean, I think a lot of people, I mean, I think you're quite right, that a lot of
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.400]   people say, "Oh, you know, what's Microsoft doing?
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.720]   And Microsoft is going downhill and Microsoft is in trouble."
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.320]   And, you know, I think the thing is that Microsoft is so, so massively successful in that kind
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   of business arena.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.400]   And it is no doubt going to make billions and billions of dollars over the next three or
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:27.880]   four years from Windows that it can afford to keep having a lot of goes at getting stuff
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.960]   right until it does get stuff right.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   So it's not going anywhere.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.280]   I mean, I think you thought that about them and then we get something we get done right.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.880]   But name something lately.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.880]   That they've been going at.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   And they've signed up on strikes.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.640]   Well, actually I can name something.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:50.560]   What they're doing with identity is leading or certainly participating in a very big way
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.640]   in the user-centric identity context.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.880]   When you say identity, you mean open ID or what do you mean?
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.880]   No, I'm talking about open ID.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.080]   They're embraced open ID.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:02.240]   And they were involved in the whole conversation that ended up with open ID being as strong
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.240]   as it is.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:09.680]   Their own effort called card space, they're involved in an open source effort around card
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:15.040]   space to, so there are non-proprietary versions kicking around out there that can interoperate
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   with them.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.560]   And so they can interoperate with open ID.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:22.320]   And that's brilliant work that's been done, but it's been done more at the rank and file
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   level.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.320]   I don't know if it's...
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.320]   Well, that's always true of Microsoft.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.560]   The individuals of Microsoft are often brilliant.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.200]   Yeah, and that's been...
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.360]   I mean, I speak of the open source community.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:39.240]   There's been a lot of very positive interaction with Microsoft around identity.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:43.600]   And of course, there's one area and it's not something you point to and say, "Well, here's
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.480]   a product that's really a feature that's part of other products."
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.640]   And yet you could say they fumbled passport.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   I mean, they were there...
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.400]   But it's because they fumbled passports.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   See, that's the thing.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.400]   They learned from passport.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.400]   Right.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.320]   If the smoking corpse of passport were laying around, Kim Cameron and the people in the identity
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.080]   group wouldn't have been able to do what they did.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   Right.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   That makes sense.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.080]   And I still have a passport sign on.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   I try to use...
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   It's still there.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   You can still use the thing.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.600]   It's pretty much ignored by everybody.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   Paul Ford...
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   We still have to...
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   Let me let go.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   I'm doing another call here because I won't want to get as many people as we can.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.680]   And Paul Ford, welcome to this week in tech.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:17.680]   Hello, Paul.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.680]   Hey, Leo.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   Where are you calling from?
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.520]   Calling from Colorado.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.320]   And what can we do for you?
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.280]   Oh, I was just wondering with Twitter and everything, where does it go from?
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.280]   From here.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.120]   Where does Twitter go or the web?
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.480]   Just Twitter in general because it's a pretty basic software.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.840]   There isn't really much to Twitter.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:44.440]   And I know that Ev is selling the rest of his business of audio and focusing on Twitter.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   What do you think?
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.880]   Robert, what would you do next with Twitter?
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.240]   I have no idea because it's the stupidest software you've ever seen, right?
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.040]   It shouldn't be anywhere.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   And yet it is.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.280]   Well, the reason it is is because all your friends are on it.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.320]   All my friends are on it, right?
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.760]   And that's what really got me-- I'm not a visionary, right?
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.360]   I'm not the guy who builds the software.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.960]   I'm not double a single barter, Dave Weiner.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.760]   All I do is look for doubling effects in society, you know, on software.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.360]   And around November of last year, the doubling effect kicked in where I got to-- I noticed
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.360]   it.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.520]   I jumped in because I said, man, this thing is doubling every, you know, couple of days
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.200]   or every two weeks.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.040]   And that's what made it interesting to me.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.520]   All my friends were on it.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.680]   Everybody I care about, you know, Ryan is on it.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.520]   And my employees are on it.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.760]   And so that told me that it was cool.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   Doc Searles, you--
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760]   I have a question about Twitter, everybody.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   I have to answer anything.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   All right, go ahead.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.160]   Is it a silo?
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   Yes.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.160]   Well, it's got an API.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   No, this is a silo.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.120]   Does somebody own the whole thing?
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:58.680]   It's been its terminal in the long run for the same reason that even AIM and MSN are,
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.320]   you know, and all those closed systems are terminal.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   It's got to be--
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   Well, I can use--
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   --putter is.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   Twitter is.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.960]   And I confess to not knowing.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.160]   I can use my jabber client to talk to it.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.240]   In fact, that's how I talk to it.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   Well, that's fine.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.160]   I mean, I suppose if it's open in the sense that it's a Lego block that doesn't, you know,
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:23.280]   if it's a Lego block and not a whole world garden one has to go into it.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.800]   No, no, it's more of a Lego block.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.200]   I would say in that sense it's--
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200]   OK.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.400]   Because there's an open API because it works with Jabber, it works with all SMS systems,
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.560]   it works with-- I mean, it is much more open than, say, AIM is.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560]   This is in that sense.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.160]   I've not tried it, but I mean, can I use it in my Linux client because I've got Jabber?
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   OK.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.640]   I use it in my blackberry with Jabber, not with SMS.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.960]   I mean, that's why I felt bad for Jason.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960]   I don't know why.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Oh, really?
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   Wow, no kidding.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.960]   I need to use your SMS client.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.160]   That's just nuts.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.920]   I don't know what-- I agree with you, Robert.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.160]   It's kind of hard to build-- to know what the next thing to build out of Twitter is.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.040]   I was kind of surprised when Ev said this is where we're going to focus because where
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.520]   do you go?
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:06.520]   I mean, part of it is it's like an RSS client where you know every item is going to be 140
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.240]   characters or less, right?
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.400]   So what kinds of things would you like to see in an RSS client where everything's 140
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.560]   characters or less?
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.960]   How about traffic information?
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.880]   How about weather information?
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   They've got that.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   They've got all that.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.680]   You know, that's a star RSS, isn't it?
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   Yeah, they obviously--
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.200]   I think you can just do that with RSS.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.920]   It is RSS, but because everything is guaranteed to be 140 characters or less, it affords a
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.440]   certain kinds of information.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.000]   And I certainly like getting headlines here better than I do in my Google Reader because
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.680]   I like to see the full text in Google Reader.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.360]   It's interesting how there's two different usage models here.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.800]   Mr. Larson, welcome.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.120]   You're next on This Week in Tech.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.680]   Hello, cyber Larson.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680]   Where are you calling from?
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   What's your real name?
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.320]   My name's Mike Duffy.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.000]   I'm calling from Patucket, Rhode Island.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.840]   I love growing up in Patucket.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.120]   Yeah, I think we might know each other, actually.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.880]   You mentioned the street that you lived on.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880]   27.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   I lived on Glenwood Avenue.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.200]   I lived on Blodgett.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.720]   Well, you know, I was like six when we moved, so I don't remember you, Mike.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   It sounds like we're the same age.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.720]   That's pretty funny.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.640]   You were talking about the way that they're trying to get rid of internet radio.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.240]   Does that apply to the podcast too?
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.320]   I have a podcast and I wanted to add music to it.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.400]   And from looking at the ASCAP and--
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   Oh, forget.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   --and for the--
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   --get license fees on music.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   --forgive me.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.680]   You can't play-- I mean, just forget playing license music on a podcast because it's not
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.680]   even streaming.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   It's stored and they charge through the roof for that, right?
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.240]   Well, it's not what they charge.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.920]   As bad as the rules are for radio, there are rules.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.200]   Unfortunately, for podcasts, it's a minefield.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.720]   You are required to clear rights with every copyright holder.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   Oh, boy.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720]   Now, you can launder it.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.480]   There is a way of laundering it, and that is by running it through an actual license
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.880]   over the air radio station.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.720]   So there's a station in San Francisco called KYOU.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.760]   That's actually offered to do that.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   There are others.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.040]   There are low-power radio stations there.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.280]   Your college stations and so forth.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:22.360]   I mean, if you get a relationship with an FCC license station because they have their
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   deals, right?
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   Right.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360]   That's how my podcasts are handled.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.680]   But I have to say, why even do this deal with the devil?
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   This is your opportunity.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.440]   Play podcast licensed music.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.120]   Play stuff from POD show.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.000]   Play stuff from Creative Commons.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.120]   This is an opportunity to play indie artists who want to be on your podcast.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.520]   Why play licensed music on a podcast?
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.920]   Again, let me jump in on that.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.880]   I was in radio for years.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880]   Not for years.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.520]   Long enough so that it's still athlete's foot and I can't ever get rid of it, right?
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.000]   There's still that in me that wants to be on the radio.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:04.520]   It just goes the crap out of me that the enormous knowledge that I have of old rock and roll,
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.040]   for example, even old classical music, some jazz, I can't use that on a podcast.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.480]   I mean, I love the fact that there are lots of new music can be played, that independent
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.920]   music can be supported.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:21.360]   And even that insane license regime allows that to happen and in fact encourages it.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.440]   But it eases out everybody whose expertise is in music that's licensed.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.440]   This is an enormous pile of stuff that just can't be touched.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.560]   It's in fact one of the reasons I own podcasts.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.080]   I would love to use the music that I know.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.360]   And the fact that I can't just, it feels like just extraordinary censorship to me.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:45.400]   And I think some of that as we as participants in this whole process, some of this is up
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   to us.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.280]   If we start to say, we're really not, I mean, if a lot of us, and I'm not saying that we
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.160]   will, but if a lot of us decided we're really just not going to buy anything from these
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   guys anymore, we're really not going to play anymore because we don't want to do what they're,
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.240]   we don't approve of this, we're really going to move.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.080]   And if a lot of podcasters, if a lot of listeners, if everyone decides to take a decisive move
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.960]   to a certain direction, they'll have to react.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.320]   And that's the thing that we're not doing is we sit there and complain and hope that
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.840]   our lawmakers will fix it, which they won't because they're getting paid by these guys
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.080]   to not do that.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:21.240]   But they, but what we, what we can do as users, as producers, as all this is to start moving
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.600]   the thing in a much more concise way and then force them to react and open it up to a point
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.640]   that works for us.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.040]   In my humble opinion, you know, I also have to say that this music restriction is great
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.160]   for talk radio and talk podcast.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.760]   I would have no doubt about it.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.240]   We don't have to worry about that.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:42.080]   And you know, that, that, that's why there's a explosion of talk podcasts.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.560]   But I, you know, you made a really good point, I think, Doc.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.600]   And there are some of the podcasts I love the most were in fact people talking about
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.400]   real music, you know, licensed music, old music, and they're gone.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.320]   Well, in fact, it's, you know, you're, you can do it.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.440]   I mean, you know, I've read lots of podcasts that have licensed music on it and the RA
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.280]   AA isn't going after them.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   The copyright holders aren't going.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.560]   In fact, they're already, they probably wouldn't, probably the copyright holders directly might.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.040]   And they, for the most part, don't give a crap.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.720]   But, you know, in my case, there's just one item that I wanted to use as a, I mean, one
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.120]   song that I wanted to use as a theme song for my podcast.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.000]   And I, I just hit enough of a dead end in trying to even find who owns the rights.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.640]   It's just, it was absolutely impossible.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:31.240]   A KCRW, which is one of the top public stations that actually plays music in Los Angeles, probably
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.760]   the most forward looking of the bunch has a daily show called Morning Becomes a Clactic.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.760]   It has an enormous, a lists of shift for public broadcasting program.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.560]   And about one out of every 20 or 30 of their shows is actually on a podcast.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.640]   They stream them every day, but it's actually on a podcast because of this rights clearing
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   issue.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.320]   And, and even there, they're one of the stations you can launder on.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.480]   They're being cautious about it.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.480]   They're in Hollywood, right?
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.800]   They're a Los Angeles station and they, they don't do it because it's such a, a huge pain
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   in the ass.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.880]   You even begin to try and figure it out.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.360]   Let's say hi to Phil in Greenville, South Carolina.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.360]   Phil, you're next on This Week in Tech.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   Hello, Phil.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.960]   Hey, Leo and the gang.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.440]   You know, we're, you're an hour into this thing and no one's really talked about the
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.000]   Vonage and the Verizon deal, which tell us what happened.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   I didn't know about it.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   What happened?
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.200]   You know, essentially Verizon judge says that Verizon has patents and that their, that
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.520]   Vonage essentially owes them, owes Verizon money.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.920]   And they said the tune is like $58 million.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.040]   Oh, that's good news for Verizon.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   Geez.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:45.480]   5.5% of all future revenues, although it looks like Verizon's take is that they're trying
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.440]   to just put them out of business.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   Wow.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.600]   Yeah, they play hard ball.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.200]   Those guys is just.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.200]   Wow.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.880]   Well, I, I, I guess I'm not surprised.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.640]   I'm surprised that they had these patents, but I'm not surprised that Verizon is going
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.640]   after Vonage.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.240]   I mean, that's a big threat to any telco and Verizon seems to be the most predatory of
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240]   all of them.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.400]   They're the ones who've got Wi-Fi kicked out of Pennsylvania.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.120]   So if you check out, so Business Week has got the story on this, which is basically that
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.000]   a Vonage sued over over five patents.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   Sorry.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.320]   And sued over five patents that it said Vonage was infringing.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   The jury said it only infringed on three and didn't do it willfully.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.720]   And so they minimized the damages at 58 million.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   Geez.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:41.400]   And, and it's, and now Vonage has to pay 5.5% of its customer fee per month to Verizon.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.600]   Well, you have to think that's putting them out of business.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.200]   I mean, they weren't, they weren't in such great shape to begin with.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   So.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:55.000]   Yeah, it's important to remember that the, that these guys are inherently legal entities.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.720]   They are not, they are, you know, they are, I think I'm pretty sure this is true.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.040]   The telcos are the lobby, the largest lobbying organization on Capitol Hill.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.200]   They're larger even than the pharmaceuticals.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.760]   They live in a regulatory habitat.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.160]   If they were outside a regulatory habitat and operating like a real business with a real
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.640]   competition and they weren't in this regulatory protectorate, like a bunch of the zoo animals,
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   they would fail.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.160]   But they, they live in this legal zone and they win these kinds of things.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.760]   It's really creepy and bad, but there it is.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.160]   Let's move on to Red Dragon 3883.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.680]   Not his real name, all wager.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.840]   Red Dragon, what is your real name?
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   Where are you calling from?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.840]   Um, yes.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   My name is Felix.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.680]   I call from West La Foye, Indiana.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   Great to talk to you, Felix.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.760]   You have a question for the panel?
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   Uh, yeah.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:54.080]   Uh, about juice and, uh, and, uh, evolution of next YouTube.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.080]   What do you think?
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.680]   It's interesting, his Viacom made a deal with juice when they wouldn't make a deal with
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   YouTube.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.680]   Yes.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   And now they are doing YouTube.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.320]   It's all right.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.280]   I think my, it's all, I mean, the thing with juice is, is that they're, it's ironically
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.760]   given the people who are, who are founding it, uh, juice is, is very, uh, it gives copyright
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.520]   holders an enormous amount of power.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520]   It's very encrypted.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520]   It's very closed.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.200]   It's very, and they're only looking for really, uh, medium to large size producers.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.680]   They're not looking for, uh, individuals.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.960]   So it's not the next YouTube really because you're, you're not as an individual.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.760]   We're going to be able to upload to something like juice.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.560]   Um, it is an exciting platform.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.720]   You know, I mean, it's, uh, it's a pretty interesting thing.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.440]   It strikes me as, is in a way taking the old business model and putting it on the net.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.040]   It's not exactly where I'd like to see the business model go.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040]   Exactly.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.240]   And I think they're fighting the web.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.480]   I, I mean, when Podtech went to a player that you can put on your own blog, our traffic
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   trip's pulled.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.840]   And why did it triple?
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:55.520]   It tripled because now you could put our stuff on your site or on your place on your
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.520]   mindset.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.520]   Hey, that's a good idea.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   I'm going to steal that idea.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]   You shouldn't answer.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   I like that idea.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   I don't know why.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.520]   I think we've done it the last two months.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.640]   You just have a little embed, uh, think what was I thinking?
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.240]   But we, we stole that idea from YouTube, right?
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.500]   Why did YouTube become the, the media distribution center for the world?
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.240]   Because they, they do centralized.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.120]   They let that player go on my blog.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.280]   So I could, you know, put a video on my blog without linking over to YouTube and making
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   them richer.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.000]   I don't know why I didn't think of that.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   I, I, I, I.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   Brilliant.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   But that's fighting the web, right?
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.480]   The people, the companies that fight the web, the fight the, the, you know, the principles
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:38.480]   behind the web are, and the, and the movements behind the web are going to, are going to
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.160]   be less exciting, less interesting.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.760]   I, I like juice because it looks cool, but I hate it because it looks cool.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.000]   It's really hard to shut that freaking thing down.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.400]   I will say a bad word, you know, because if you're boss walks and you're watching video,
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   he knows it.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.800]   Where the hell is the, where the hell is the clothes button on that?
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.560]   I don't think John Furrier is yelling at you for watching juice.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560]   I certainly know.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560]   No, he's not.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.560]   John, John's a cool guy.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.560]   I have cool boss.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.880]   I'll be the last guy of a yelling at you.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.880]   But, but you know, normal people who work at, you know, normal companies have to worry
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   about.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   Right.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   There's no boss button.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   Make note to sell.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.480]   But I do think, I think the juice is, is very much designed.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.720]   I mean, what they're hoping to do, of course, is to build something that is like the next,
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.280]   you know, the next TV is this hyperactive TV content because when you look at what they're,
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.360]   what they're including, the ability to chat with other people watching the shows, the
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.840]   ability to get other interactive content.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.280]   I mean, these are the things that they're, I'm not saying that they're going to be successful,
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.120]   but they are, it's, it's not really designed to be the web on in a player format.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.360]   It's really designed to be TV with added interactivity.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.520]   And you know, and, and I don't think, I don't know if they're going to be that successful,
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.640]   but I think that what's interesting for us as producers, and I'm, since I'm one of those,
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.560]   and, and for the consumers is where I think we're really about to see a nuclear war between,
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.640]   you know, about five or six of these big guys that are about to not, not CBS and NBC, but
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.520]   the juice, the YouTube, the Apple TV.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.440]   You got to figure Verizon and AT&T want to be in that business too.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.960]   Well, what's, what's interesting that we've seen is what, what, well, actually, they actually
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.600]   are a lot of what these cable companies are doing, the cable networks.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.720]   So the Comcast, the AT&T, the Verizon's, they're, the problem with their cable offering is it's
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   been pretty much commoditized.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.440]   You know, you're just buying a cable.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   Same channel.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.160]   I don't even know what a cable company is.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160]   Exactly.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.360]   What a lot of them though is what they're, what they're moving towards doing.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.360]   And a couple of them are really taking a forward push on this is they want to buy a lot of
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.280]   their own custom content that's video on demand for their network.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.920]   And I think that's what we're going to start seeing them do to differentiate their network
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.600]   from others is they now have this big pipe.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.960]   You know, they, they are, you know, they can give you all this video on demand.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.800]   They've been moving towards this IPTV and, and that is exceptionally good for producers
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:52.440]   and really, really good for niche content being available.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.960]   It's not so good for Hollywood because now suddenly on your cable network, it's not just
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.960]   Apple TV.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.960]   It's not just Xbox.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.560]   It's not just PS3 or just on your cable TV.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.880]   You're going to be able to watch a whole bunch of these little short, short pieces.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.440]   And, and these aren't pieces that are like YouTube quality.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.160]   I mean, we are doing five shows right now for syndicators that are connected to, you
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.680]   know, a lot of the stuff that's happening and, or, you know, or a syndicator, a company
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.680]   called On Networks.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.440]   And we're delivering at 1080p.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.360]   This is not, we know we're not making lots of little content.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.280]   We are, you know, it's, it's there and they're ones that are finding those things, you know,
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.280]   out.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   So it's an interesting, interesting time to be.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.840]   Well, I want to wrap the consumer in and produce.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:33.840]   I want to wrap this up.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.920]   I think we could go for hours.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.120]   It's been, it's really been a fascinating conversation.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.200]   And I want to thank you.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.800]   Alex Lindsey's Pixel Core is at PixelCore.com.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.000]   And by the way, I think we still have some seats left for GMT.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   A couple.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.200]   There's a couple left for, so yeah, and that was really funny, but in it's out by Southwest.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.040]   The, it's like the exact opposite where it's just all gear, gear talk.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   You know, really.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.760]   This is our podcast seminar we're going to be doing into the month in San Francisco.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.560]   If you're going to be in San Francisco, please, we'd love to see you there.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.680]   It's $200 go to PixelCore.com to register, but do hurry because I think we're going to
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.920]   be full pretty soon.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.280]   That's going to be March 27th through 30th.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.680]   We'll be doing Twit There Live as well as Mac Break Live and Mac Break Weekly.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.480]   And Scott Born will be there.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.320]   Alex Lindsey and I will be all teaching.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.800]   And I know Merlin says, can I come?
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.560]   I think we go let Merlin in.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.400]   Yeah, I think we'll let Merlin man in.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.880]   I'm very jealous.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   You can come.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.880]   Come on up.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880]   Come on, Robert.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.480]   We'd love to have one of them.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480]   Come on up.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.480]   I want in on the party.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   All right.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   It's going to be fun.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   Come on in.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   PixelCore.com.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480]   We'll find a special seat for Robert.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.720]   Maybe we can get him to do a lecture or two on content.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.280]   He certainly knows more than most.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.960]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:46.360]   And PixelCore.tv is home for all the PixelCore video cast, including a lot of those 1080P podcasts
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   like Mac Break.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.360]   Yeah, baby.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.120]   Robert, what do you want to plug?
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.640]   A Scobble Show.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.640]   At PodTech.com.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.640]   That's my video show.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   PodTech.com.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.160]   I go around the world and interview cool geeks that Leo doesn't get.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.640]   It's very, very cool.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.520]   Yeah, because I'm not willing to leave my home in Petaluma.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.280]   So that's why I'm stuck here in my chair.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.280]   They come to you.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.280]   They come to me, baby.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.680]   Well, hey, this was a great panel.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:12.680]   I was thrilled.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.680]   I'm thrilled.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.240]   Will Harris has a new blog.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   It is willwilharris.co.uk.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.240]   What's the name of that again?
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.720]   It has a great name.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   The end of the world?
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.720]   No, it's nothing.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.440]   It's just called Where's Will.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   Where's Will?
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   That's it.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.440]   Where's Will?
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.440]   Well, now you know.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440]   Willharris.co.uk.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.600]   And I'm so glad we could get Doc on the show.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.080]   I've been a huge fan of Doc Serals ever since the Clute Train Manifesto.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   Thanks.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.080]   It's like, guys.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.080]   It does such good stuff.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.080]   And I hope you will come back.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.200]   I'll do whatever you want, man.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.200]   And I'm available.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.200]   Sure I love to.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.880]   Well, now that Steve Gilmore no longer has his hooks into you, I'd like to get you
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880]   up.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.080]   Well, he's the only guy that hooks into me is what he's going to do.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   All right.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080]   He was not pretty.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.360]   He's working with me, by the way.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360]   Is he really?
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.320]   Yeah, he's telling me what to do now.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.240]   Well, I always wanted to get Doc on to it.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240]   I always thought he'd be a great contributor.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.720]   And obviously, I was right.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.080]   But because you're part of the Gilmore gang, I didn't want to break up the old gang.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.080]   But now that they're--
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.600]   Well, these things are, you know, it's not like old, you know, team.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.200]   No, we all work together, of course.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.200]   It's cool.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.200]   Exactly.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.200]   Lead you.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   Doc, what do you want to plug?
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   Anything you got going?
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   Well, actually what I'd like to plug is Project VRM.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   It's at projectvrm.org.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.560]   VRM is the reciprocal of CRM.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.960]   It's a vendor relationship management.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.320]   It's how the customer manages vendors write the device for it.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.160]   It's my project, not just mine, but many people at the Berkman Center at Harvard.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.120]   That's where it's being headquartered.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120]   And that's the work I'm doing there.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.120]   And it's actually just not--
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120]   It's not my work.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.120]   It's a lot of people's work.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.880]   And it's a new idea.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   It's experimental.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.000]   And it's something we're thinking out loud about.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.120]   And anyway, go to Project VRM.org.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.760]   It's just a wiki.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.960]   But that means if you care about that, you can get interested in it and contribute.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.400]   I mean, we do love the idea.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400]   We do need to manage our vendor relations.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.960]   Yeah, what CRM is so broken.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.080]   That's the subject of a whole show right there.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.920]   But rather than complain about what's wrong with the way customer service works, let's
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.480]   fix it from the customer side of the idea.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.480]   I agree.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.480]   That's fantastic.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.360]   The work in a way that you began with Cloutre.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.360]   That's exactly right.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.800]   We can do something else to fix that.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.280]   Let's do it ourselves.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.840]   We are on Twit.tv.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.400]   That's the home of all the Twit podcasts.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.360]   And of course, we've got some great merchandise.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.640]   Now we don't really make any money on it, but you wanted it.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.120]   And we decided to go with the best in the business this time around.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.640]   So we've got Scottie Best doing the hoodies, the fleeces.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.600]   We've got great hats with hidden pockets.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.400]   And ThinkGeek provides the fulfillment company.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400]   So you can either go to...
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.160]   Actually, it's just go to Twit.tv.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.400]   That'll link you right through to ThinkGeek and the new Scottie Best.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   Twit merchandise.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400]   I wear it all the time.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   It's really nice stuff.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.160]   While you're there, we do appreciate any donation you'd like to make.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.600]   We don't really have advertisers.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.040]   Not through any choice of our own, but we do need to pay the bandwidth bills.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.600]   Thank goodness AOL comes through for us and cash fly.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.840]   But there are still plenty of other expenses and your donation really helps keep us going.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.200]   That's Twit.tv.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.200]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.400]   Thanks to TalkShoe for providing.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.800]   I kind of surprised them.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.440]   I am bushed to TalkShoe and they performed admirably.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.640]   And I think this was such a success.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.960]   We'll probably do Twit Live, if not from now on, much of the time from now on.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.520]   So thank you everybody on TalkShoe for joining us.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.920]   I'm Leo Laport, another Twit.

[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:44.680]   (dramatic music)
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:56.840]   - This is a crap generation from--
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.760]   (dramatic music)

[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.960]   - I'm a prank yo man.

[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.200]   - This one didn't attempt to draw a piece.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.960]   (dramatic music)
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.480]   - This is the week from now on.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.800]   - This is going to be our servers day.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.200]   (dramatic music)

[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.040]   - Sweet Gintak.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:25.880]   - Yeah.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.640]   (dramatic music)
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.960]   - Sweet Gintak.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.200]   (dramatic music)
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.040]   - Tack.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.880]   (dramatic music)
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.720]   - Tack.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.720]   (dramatic music)
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.680]   - My friends, my twits, are you ready?
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.440]   (audience cheering)

[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.880]   I'm really don't.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.720]   - Let me introduce the table mates.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:54.000]   (dramatic music)
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.080]   - John C. DeBore.

[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.520]   The case went in our system.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.360]   (audience cheering)
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.240]   The case went in high.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.080]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   (dramatic music)
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.080]   - This is amazing.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.840]   (dramatic music)

[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:49.840]   - Do it in the Twitter.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.680]   - All right.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.760]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   Do it in the Twitter.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.600]   All right.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.520]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.360]   Do it in the Twitter.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   All right.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.240]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.040]   Do it in the Twitter.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   All right.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.960]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.800]   Do it in the Twitter.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.800]   All right.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.720]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.560]   Do it in the Twitter.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.560]   All right.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.400]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.240]   Do it in the Twitter.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.240]   All right.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.160]   Do it in the Twitter, baby.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.000]   Do it in the Twitter.
