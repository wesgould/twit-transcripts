[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:22.600]   This is Twitch, this weekend tech, Episode 61 for July 9th, 2006.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   I want you, Will, to do this entire show in Cockney Rimming Slam. That's too proper.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   It's your assignment. We have a great cast today and let's welcome from overseas, a guy
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   who's staying up very late to do this, Will Harris of bit-tech.net. Will is late to fix
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   us up because we did such a hash of the Conrail and Miram discussion last week. So we're going
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.600]   to get the real skinny from Mr. Harris. David Prager is here from Revision 3. Hello, David.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   Hello, welcome. Thank you. You're welcoming the listeners and I think that's nice of you.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.600]   I'm a very generous with open arms. Robert Herron from DL.TV. Hi, Robert. Hey, how are you doing?
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   Patrick's not here. He's at a wake. I don't know what that means. I know what it means,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   but I hope it's nobody near and dear of any way. Condolences to Patrick. And from Devorak.org/blog,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   the one and only, wearing his rainbow haired wig, John C. Devorak. I do my best. Do you have your
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   John 16 sign today? No, I should start carrying that around, I think.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   I actually thought it was kind of interesting that the head of the FIFA Medical Committee,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   FIFA's world organization that sponsors the World Cup, is named Devorak. Dr. Jiri Devorak,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   or maybe it's Iurji. It's J-R-R-I. Devorak. It's probably Jiri. Any relationship? I never heard of him.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   But you know, probably. He's probably from Czechoslovakia. He's from Czechoslovakia.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Are all Devorak. It's the Smith of Czechoslovakia. Oh, okay. Yeah, pretty much.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   And then it probably is Iurji if it's Smith. If it's Smith. If it's Czechoslovakia.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   Iurji the Vorak. Anyway, the reason he comes up is there was a news story. This is completely.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   This is our World Cup moment in this show. It has nothing to do with tech. But one of the reasons I, you know,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   I just can't, we've got Prager Watches Soccer, Will Watches Soccer, or football, as others will call it.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   But I just can't get into it. One thing is the low scoring, but the other thing is all this fake injuries.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   And as it turns out, Dr. Devorak says that in more than half the cases,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   would a player receive treatment on the field medical staff reported no injuries in their post-match reports.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   In other words. Yeah, and then the other thing that's phenomenal is called diving, which is somebody.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   Yeah, but this is where, you know, this has been perfected largely in the NBA.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Of course, nobody really pays any attention to it. You know what? You're right.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   You're right. Where a guy flies, his arms go flying and he makes a lot of thunk when he hits.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   And he can't really do it as well on grass and make it too convincing, but they do it anyway.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   I love it. Well, congratulations to Italy on their victory in the World Cup.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   I don't know if they even need the doctor to prove this. I mean, if they're writhing in pain on the ground
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   and then they get up and keep playing, then obviously they don't need the post-game diagnosis of no injury.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Pretty obvious. You know, I make a couple of personal comments here before I get the show started.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Yes. A couple of things we've done. You're like, I want to just get them out of the way because they're still getting
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   email about my request for the Icelandic Reiki of Vikka. Yeah, did you get a sweater?
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   Yeah, I got a whole bunch of letters from different people, including a number of people in Iceland who listened to the show.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   We have a lot of worldwide listeners. Oh, it's wonderful. I got a lot of these.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   Anyway, they, you know, unfortunately the hard rock and Reiki of Vikka shut down a year and a half ago, which makes it a little difficult.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   But there's one guy, although I haven't heard back from him for a while, he says he knew the owner and there may be some of these old sweaters, you know, an
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   aware house someplace he doesn't absolutely know for sure. But I think it's unlikely I'm going to get another one of these sweaters, even though
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   as cool as they are. And one other note, I, on the cranky geek show, I think a week ago, I wore the Ronaldo Brazilian
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   jersey, of course, they lost to France. And I'm just going to throw this out to anybody out there just listening from France. They want to send me a zidani
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   jersey. I'll wear it on the cranky geek show and point to it. You don't want to wear an Italy jersey?
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Well, I don't know who the Sousa star at on Italy's team. Yeah, somebody from Italy wants to send me one. I'll do that the following week.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   So whoever gets me the shirt first. So whoever your guest is, if you're wearing Zidongers, you're going to headbutt him if you get upset with him?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   Right in the chest. Not to turn this into the soccer broadcast, but this is exactly, I didn't see the game, but I'm seeing now that it was tied
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   and Italy won on penalty kicks, which is, which is, I think they should just do penalty kicks and cut the game down to 20 minutes.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   It's ridiculous. That happens far too often in the game. We're going to hear, get such email for this. I understand.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   No, I think soccer, I mean, FIFA would agree that that's a lousy way to win a World Cup. They should either play till somebody wins, although it's such a long game as it is. I don't know if they could do that.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   Or just eliminate this off-sides rule and let them score. Well, what's, it's not as long as American football games. It's an hour and a half of running. It is as long.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   No, no, the game's over faster. I mean, they got 15 and a half time max plus 90 minutes of running time.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   But they're running for an hour and a half. Yeah, but I'm saying like, you know, a foot, an American football game takes a good three hours.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   These games are commercials and you know, I know. That's another reason it's not popular in the US. They can't keep stopping the clock. They don't stop the clock.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   Right. And it just keeps playing. These are, we're pretty exhausted though, toward the end of that game.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   Yeah, I don't know how they do it. I really don't. I mean, they're clearly the most, the best condition athletes.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   I think the penalty kicks well. I think it's possible. I find it hard to believe anybody's better condition than a basketball player.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   But they're free to make. If you want to take it to the next level, I don't think anybody's a better condition than a professional heavyweight boxer.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   Well, that's probably true. That's probably true. All right. That's pretty rough.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   I want to thank you for joining us on this week in sport.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   Lawsuits fly over Google founders big private jet. I didn't realize that they had bought a 767.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   This is a jet that normally carries 180 passengers. It's three times as heavy as the conventional executive jet.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   Sergey Brin and Larry Page bought this. It was a used one. It's from the Qantas fleet.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   And they're converting it to hold 50 passengers, including by the way, a special executive suite for the president of Google, Eric Schmidt,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   a lounge in the front with two adjoining state rooms for the co-founders farther aft.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   There's a plan, if you want to look at it in the Wall Street Journal of the jet, this thing is talk about excess.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   So what are the lawsuits for?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   Well, the company that they hired to do the blue city holdings is the company that owns it.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   And the company that they hired to do the redesign, Leslie Jennings, a high-end aviation designer.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Apparently, it's not going well in the transformation. This is the guy who did Paul Allen's jet.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   He also does the Queen's jet.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   Paul Allen's got a 757 though, right?
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Is that bigger than a 767?
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   No, no, a 767 is big.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   That's pretty big.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   It's generally an old-a-series plane.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   So it would be a plane that these guys could... It's a little more practical, I think.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   I don't want to defend the fact that these guys are throwing money at stuff like this.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   But it's a little more practical of a plane. If you can afford it, then these little private jets that don't really make...
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   You can make a trip from San Francisco to Paris on a 767 nonstop. You can't really do it with too many other planes.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   That's a good point.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   And the idea, apparently, was that they would take... They want to take big groups places.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   So it's not just for Larry and Sergey and Eric. I mean, it's... They want to take...
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   Not just for Eric.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   Apparently Eric's got a nice little suite up front there.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   I bet he does.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   Well, didn't they say that one of them wanted a hammock hung from the ceiling?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   That's the way to fly.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   And then the other one... I'm sorry, I can't remember which one was...
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   It was having an argument over whether or not he could have a California king-sized bed in his room.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   And eventually Sergey and Larry were like, "I want the king-sized bed. No, I want the king-sized bed."
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   And Eric Schmidt had to step in and go, "Look, you can both have king-sized beds. Let's go back to work."
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   Whatever happened to the Hugh Heffner's round bed, they could probably get that in a little bit better.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   What do they need a king-sized bed?
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   I think they should all sleep in the same bed. I think that's funny.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   Anyway, I'll put a link in the show notes to the design.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   What man? I mean, we're talking just the most elegant thing you can imagine.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   A dining room, a play room, just very, very... I'd love to get it right on this plane if it ever gets...
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   If it's ever done.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   We'll get it right.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   Will we?
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   Yeah, we should do a twit from the plane. That's what I want to do.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   Oh, I don't know about that. That's my goal.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   Did you see that the Emmys now have a broadband award for websites?
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   The Emmys?
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   The Emmys.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   But for websites or for broadband...
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   Does anybody think that the Emmys...
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   Does the Emmys...
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   The nominations were the worst possible nominations that could come up with those Emmys?
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   Does Emmys...
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   The nominations were done by a bunch of hippies.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   Well, apparently they changed the way they do it.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   The voters, the Emmys members as a whole vote, and then the top...
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   I think the top ten vote getters are then narrowed down to the nominees by committee.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   It's a smaller committee doing it.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   So that's probably why they're so... They are kind of strange.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.600]   But the nominations are for shows I never even heard of.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   Yeah, canceled shows in some cases.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   No, there's an Emmys award now for broadband news and documentary programming.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   So you're up for it.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   Well, let me tell you... I will tell you.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   Let's see.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   For news and documentaries, New York Times garnered three nominations.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   Nicholas Christoff's multimedia presentation on atrocities in Sudan.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   Oh, that's an exciting show.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   A pair of videos on the drug policies of Bolivia's new president is a good use of multimedia
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   and a seven-part interview series on child porn.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   Washington Post got two nominations, a web documentary on the effects of corruption, poverty,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   and the history of authoritarian rule in Azerbaijan.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   Does this stuff interest anybody?
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   And the four videos in the lives affected by Hurricane Katrina.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   That's good.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   Also nominated MTV News segments.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   That's a good exchange.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   You hear from child porn to MTV.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   MTV News segments and the National Geographic's webcast on Katrina has shown on the same page.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   So these are all traditional print publications and newspapers that are getting these nominations.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   That's interesting.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   Liveates.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   Yeah, these aren't very well-witted from nominations.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   These are terrible.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   And ESPN won a broadband sports Emmy in May for its off-mikes webcast.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   It doesn't seem like they reflect really the most exciting or interesting stuff going on
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600]   online.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   This is the worst I've ever actually made.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   This show is a disaster.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   It's mainstream media.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   They clearly don't get it.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   They should clearly have a rocket boom on it.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   Do we even want to talk about this rocket boom thing or something?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   Should we just let it go on?
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   I just throw it at that.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   I thought it was a fascinating story.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   I mean, like the amount of gossip and it was straight out of the-- oh my God.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   I think a garnered more press than Star Jones getting fired from The View, which is a major
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   network television.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.100]   Well, I think one of the reasons it garnered so much press is because those so much inclined
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.760]   to be writing and talking about it on the web are the people that knew about it or knew
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.600]   what it was far more than the average viewer of The View.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   I was reading the Dig--
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   Well, I was talking about the law.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   It is.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   It's very inside-base.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   I was reading the Dig comments and a number of people in Dig.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   I mean, I would say half the comments said, "Well, I never heard of this show until this
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   happened."
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   So let me just tell you people what happened.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   Rocket Boom, which is a video podcast we had Andrew Barron, the producer of Rocket Boom,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   on the infamous Twit 57, kind of has gone boom, kind of like Kim Jong-il's rocket itself.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   Amanda, we don't know exactly what happened.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   Well, I have some ideas.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.600]   He's not good.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   Rocket Boom.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   That's terrible.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   All right.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.200]   Well, it's getting worse by the minute.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.800]   So Amanda claims she was fired.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.360]   Andrew claims she walked off.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   He said, "This is the first I knew about it."
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.760]   Any event.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.520]   He's got a good-- I think he's got a very good replacement.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.480]   You might know this woman, I will, because she's from, I think, MTV Europe, isn't she?
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.360]   Yeah, it's something.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   It's not MTV.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's like MTV, I still do something.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   She's a Brit.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   Oh, she?
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.600]   I've never heard of it, but she looks quite--
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   She's cute.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.680]   People like Amanda.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.440]   People like Amanda, but you know, I think this will be the test.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.600]   It's a classic battle between a producer and talent, right?
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.280]   Who's more important to show like that?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.840]   There's going to be, you know, a record audience tomorrow when Rocket Boom goes back
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.600]   to everybody wants to see what it's going to be like.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.120]   It's possibly the best thing that could have happened.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   I agree.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   Yeah, I'm a record.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.720]   There were some people who said it was a staged publicity stunt.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.640]   I mean, clearly it's not at this point.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.160]   So the question is, can Amanda go on?
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.280]   Jason Calicanis at AOL, another person who was on this broadcast, offered her a job
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   immediately.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.600]   If what happened is anything happened with that that you know of?
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.280]   Not that I know of.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.760]   Jason did a weird thing on his blog.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.160]   I don't know why he did this.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.880]   He said, I've got a few minutes.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.240]   Anybody want to interview me?
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.120]   And Twit, anybody out there?
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   So I said I'm an email.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.560]   I didn't respond to me, so screw him.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.480]   Well, that's the weirdest thing in the first one.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.000]   He has my number.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.640]   Was anybody want to interview him?
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.640]   Is that weird or what?
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   That is so weird.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.360]   Well, you just said screw him on Twitter.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.120]   He'll probably write about that in his blog against it.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120]   I know, couldn't care less.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120]   Yeah, it's OK.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   Just as long as he has a link.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   Well, that's what we're learning.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   There's no such thing as bad publicity in the blogosphere.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.640]   That's for darned.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.160]   It's all about the Google rank.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.040]   It's the most totally about you.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.800]   So I think Rocket Boom will do very well if this new, and I don't know her name, and
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   I'll have to find it.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.560]   If this new person replacing Amanda is halfway decent, I mean, let's face it.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.480]   People watch because Amanda was cute, right?
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.000]   It wasn't that compelling a show.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.600]   If she's not Rachel Slur on the, you know, journalistic and production integrity of her,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   she would feel a little like--
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.960]   She had a certain kind of a nerdy charm, I think, that it appealed to the larger 15 to
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   24 audience.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   She said something about her.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   It was a little stiff.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   It wasn't as--
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.000]   I think that was part of it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   That was the charm.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.240]   I think I'm just guessing.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.120]   But I think it's difficult because she hasn't-- I don't think been around long enough to
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.640]   be a sort of true personality, maybe.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.680]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.400]   It certainly-- if it was her decision to leave, it was probably premature.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.920]   She says, according to her, she has a video that's floating around.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   Yeah, I saw the video.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.600]   She says she was fired.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.800]   Andrew hasn't spoken too much, but he says it came as a surprise to him.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   He didn't think he fired her.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   That's good.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   I know.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.200]   I hate to give it too much credence.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   You know what?
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   There is a big story.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.000]   And this, I think, was what Jason Calicanis wanted to be interviewed about.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.840]   AOL says, "It's going to be free."
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.320]   And I thought that was a shocker.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.520]   AOL-- this is according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.200]   What did I charge for it, though?
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   Oh, quite a bit.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.760]   I think US 26 bucks for dialogue.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.240]   This is not a pot.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.240]   This is not going to happen.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   I think it is.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.240]   And here's why.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.160]   In other words, dial up will not be free.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.960]   But if you're using to bring your own access, in other words, you're paying for broadband
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.600]   and you're just paying the $8 or $9, whatever it is, $10 a month to get access to AOL, that
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   will become free.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   So the dial up--
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Well, is that any different than what it is now?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.240]   I mean, I can go to AOL.com and get my email or whatever it is.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.240]   That's true.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240]   You get a lot of those services for free.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.600]   And I think AOL has been moving in that direction anyway.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   So do you get the-- the question is, do you get the software with its anti-spy or its
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.040]   kind of cruddy, anti-spy or pretty antivirus?
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   Oh.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.200]   Well, I think it's a software, frankly.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   You might get that for free.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.400]   I think it makes sense for AOL to give this stuff away.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   It has no premium value.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.680]   It gets the value you show.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   Go ahead, Robert.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.840]   How's it going to say it gets their name out there if nothing else?
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.480]   Were they considering making dial up access free as well?
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   No.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.960]   Dial up is very expensive for them.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.560]   I think they'd like to get rid of dial up.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.560]   They've raised the price to the point where it costs more than broadband in some, in many
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.560]   cases.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.800]   You know, I'm glad that they still have it.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.600]   I maintain an AOL account just for the purposes of emergency internet activity in situations
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.800]   where there's a problem.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.000]   Somewhere where you had a power outage once.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.960]   And there's no way to get online except on a dial up thing.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.560]   And it was kind of funny because they hadn't gone up online on dial up for probably a year
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.200]   or two and I'm thinking, oh man, can I even remember how to do this?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.120]   Can you-- you can't get an AOL man.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.200]   You can't get devorec@aol.com for free though.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.520]   You have to be an AOL subscriber to have that.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   So I would think--
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.520]   That's the change.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.360]   I mean, apparently you'll be able to get that for free or if you already have it, you'll
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.520]   can stop paying for it if you've got broadband.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.240]   And I have devorec@aol.com but it's like--
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.320]   You use it for the access number to dial in if you're stuck in the words.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.920]   I never look at the mail really and there's no reason to and it's just a box filled with
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   spam.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.120]   I sometimes data mine it to see what the spam world's doing.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.640]   According to if somebody writes me, I'll never respond because I just never see it.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.240]   According to this story by Grant Gross, IDG News Service, AOL has been suffering a big
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   decline in subscribers.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.560]   In the first quarter of this year, AOL was down 3.1 million subscribers from a year
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.240]   earlier to 18.6 million subscribers.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.040]   Revenue down 7%, 13% fall in subscription revenue.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.880]   On the other hand, advertising rates up 26%.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.120]   Well, it makes kind of make sense.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.760]   What's going to be profitable for them eyeballs?
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.000]   Well, let's get those eyeballs up by giving it away.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.160]   You know, this is part of the consolidation where Comcast and the Bell companies are taking
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.440]   over the world.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   And AOL?
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.160]   What does AOL's role in that?
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.360]   I mean, AOL, what can they do?
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.040]   I mean, they can't give you a DSL line or without work with one of these other guys.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.320]   So they're basically saying, hey, cable modem connection.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.960]   We're no longer an ISP.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.520]   We're Google.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   They should have-- you know what?
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   They should have done some time ago.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.240]   It started to work on mesh networks and gone wireless or something.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.960]   I don't know what-- I mean, that's what they're going to have to do to save the company because
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.240]   it's just going to lose everybody.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   That's where Google's gone.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   I'm going to have it.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   Google's not going to get killed off if they don't do something.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.160]   Right.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.160]   These guys are.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   No, you're right.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   It's funny.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.600]   It's been a struggle for them since day one.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.680]   AOL has just been so up and down.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.160]   Do you think even it's like a simplified content portal?
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.720]   There's still no money even there.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   No, I think there is.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   I think that's what they're doing.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.000]   I think they're reinventing themselves as a content company.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.120]   And look, they've got time that they certainly know content.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   They've got content.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.400]   They've done very well with things like Live 8.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   Hey, they've got an Emmy nomination.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.120]   They do all media, though.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   That's the interesting thing.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.400]   They're not seeing-- you know, Google's seen as kind of the hip thing.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.320]   AOL's seen as the internet for people who don't get the internet.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   Training wheels we used to call it.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.520]   And I think they're really trying to change that.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.840]   I think one of the reasons that they gave us bandwidth, by the way, is to kind of improve
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   their image.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.000]   Well, they don't win that man, don't they?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Yeah, they got that when they bought Netscape.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   They got the Nelsoft as a part.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Yeah, they have a lot of good stuff.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I'm telling you, they're going to have to--
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.680]   I think, you know, Calla Canis is actually an asset to them.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.840]   He's such a stir up of trouble.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.680]   And I think, you know, he's a senior VP over there.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.600]   I think he's the kind of guy who can go into the boardroom and pound the table a little
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.120]   bit and maybe make some changes.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.560]   Or maybe wake them up.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560]   Wake them up anyway.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   I mean, seriously, they're probably sleeping.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.760]   Literally, you mean?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   Much old guys.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.040]   Now, last week we talked a little-- what?
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.480]   Last week we talked a little bit about Intel trying to counter AMD.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.320]   By moving its Conro, its chip up, they call it, it's the Core 2 chip.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.200]   And well, you were listening and you said we made a hash of it.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   In fact, you weren't the only one.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   So one of the things-- I think we met-- one of the things that I think was critical that
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.440]   we missed is that Core 2 is a whole new core.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.600]   It's not the next-- it's not Pentium 4 on steroids.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.080]   No, no, it's like a whole different thing.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.960]   I mean, I think there's been a few things all around this topic all week.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:47.920]   And one thing has been the sort of AMD's stock price sliding on bad-- bad announcements.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.920]   Well, AMD said that their sales have been down.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   Big time.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.520]   From last quarter, but up on the same time last year.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.240]   So I'll make it that what you will.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.840]   The difference is the question is whether they're down just because the market's a bit
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.800]   slower because Intel's been going after them with massive price cuts.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.520]   And the reason the Intel's going after them with massive price cuts is because it's got
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.360]   a new CPU coming out next week, which is the Core 2 Duo in the desktop form.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.200]   Now, a bit tech-- you've been benchmarking this Conro.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.000]   In fact, you were the first really to tell us how good Conro is.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.080]   What is the latest on Conro?
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.200]   So the latest is we just got three new chips in which represent the very top-end sort of
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.680]   extreme edition chip, sort of mid-range chip and the cheapest chips version.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.560]   And they're all pretty darn good.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.320]   I won't repeat to you because Zara, our labs guys, were saying about them because I couldn't
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.040]   really repeat that on it.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.800]   But it was very, very, very positive, should we say.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   Did they say, what is that word now at Crips that we want to say?
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   Crips.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   Blimey.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   That's a cool cut.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.160]   Blimey, that's good.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   It's super.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   Well, you're under non-disclosure right for the next couple of days.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.520]   I think you can break the news on Wednesday or something like that.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   What's the--
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   The 14th.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   14th.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.480]   So you can only-- can you summarize results without breaking your NDA?
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.960]   I was-- I think you can--
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.160]   I can summarize for them.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.240]   It's supposed to be pretty fast.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   It's a corker.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   How about you, Robert?
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.640]   Have you been playing with them at DLTV?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.280]   I haven't seen one yet.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.840]   So in the person who has seen it, of course, is on vacation right now.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.640]   But all of our initial testing shows there as fast as can be.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.200]   Now, so here's the real question.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.440]   Faster than anything AMD.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   That's the question.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   Better than AMD.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.920]   And I think AMD has got some initiatives to sort of planning over the next couple of
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   months.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.680]   And it doesn't look like there's going to be anything really to take on them, to take
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.600]   on the Intel stuff.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   The port--
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   Certainly not in the--
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   Sorry, go on.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.400]   Desktop as Conroe, the portable as Merum.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.040]   Same kind of speed improvements?
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.840]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.920]   I mean, the desktop chip previously was the Pentium 4.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.680]   And Conroe is such a massive improvement over Pentium 4.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:05.000]   Merum is not quite such a massive improvement over the previous Pentium M. But it's still
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.120]   faster and less hot.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   And it's definitely going to be a killer chip.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.240]   Last week, Bill McCrone said that the pipelines are shorter.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.080]   Is that one of the features of the new core?
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.960]   Yeah, shorter and wider.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.000]   So you can do a bit more in less time.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.280]   Wider, like 64-bit wider or wider--
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.840]   Oh.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.400]   What does that mean?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.840]   Wider and pipeline.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.680]   It's sort of things like you can do the sort of SSE multimedia extensions and stuff.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.200]   Yeah, OK.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.720]   You can now do like an entire instruction in just one clock cycle.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   Single instruction.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.440]   One and half clock cycle.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.920]   Yeah, single instruction multiple data.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.360]   So you operate one instruction over a broad amount of data.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.280]   I mean, if you check out--
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.120]   I'll get the plug in.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.200]   If you check out BitSec, there's a little tech discussion of intricate detectors over there.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.760]   Can I have a question?
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.840]   Did you guys, when you were analyzing the chip, did you put it in?
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.120]   Because I know that the people at ZIF, from what I could find out--
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.160]   because I wasn't there for any of these demonstrations.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.320]   But they, you know, Intel controlled a lot of the activities, even though I guess we
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.080]   got to look at the chip in some way, shape, or form ourselves.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.320]   But did you put it into any real world test?
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.480]   Because a lot of the speed of this thing, from what I understand, is based on a couple
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.240]   of pretty much older benchmarks or benchmarks that are as good as they can be because our
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   benchmarks--
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   So we--
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   So we--
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.240]   So we run out of photo shop or anything?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   So we run them.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   We just sort of sat down and we were like, you know, this can be some new CPUs.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   Let's make some tests.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.160]   We basically wrote our own scripts, which involve Photoshop iTunes compression, which
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.640]   is multi-threaded, video compression, video decoding and multiplexing, all these various
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.120]   different kinds of things, as well as 3D gaming.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.960]   And it was faster in all of those.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   What about Wordstar?
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   Did you try Wordstar?
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   No, Wordstar was--
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   Sign this up.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   --what's on my list, unfortunately.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.440]   I'm sure it's a real screamer with Wordstar.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   But I'm sorry.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   Yeah, really good Word.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.200]   Those stock commands and, you know, just incredible.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.640]   Command K, Control KS is like--
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.840]   I don't even remember any of that stuff.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.120]   You know what's weird?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   I do.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   It's like in my fingers still.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.880]   You're the only-- well, actually, maybe some of those movements I bet-- I've noticed
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.600]   this before and I've talked to other people about this.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.000]   And I challenge anybody out there who's listening to this show to go find a computer that's
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.800]   running Windows 3.1 and actually try to use it.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.840]   It's like you don't remember any of this craziness that you had to do.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   It had to like task manager.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.480]   How many people can remember how to navigate around DOS?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.360]   Something dumped me to a DOS prompt today and I was like, I need to get to this directory.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   What the heck is the command?
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.280]   I keep typing LS in DOS, but that's-- but I do remember a little bit of DOS.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.760]   I do remember all that.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.880]   Oh, the super secret in getting around DOS-- getting around DOS directory structure is
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.220]   you just-- you have to do the till the-- the till-- the first seven letters, the till
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.220]   then the number one.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.220]   I hate that.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.220]   That's stupid.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.220]   Because Windows could never-- DOS could never connect the Windows.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.340]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.340]   So well, that's good news.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.540]   So it sounds like if somebody did not yet buy a core duo chip, it would have been--
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.540]   Oh, man, hold off.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.140]   Yeah, it would be worth waiting till next week for sure.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.640]   There's some rumor that Apple has been waiting for its high-end tower machines until the
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   core two.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   Absolutely.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.920]   So those are going to hit-- those are going to hit, I think, fairly soon afterwards.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:31.860]   There are those who have looked inside Apple's tiger operating system who say that, in fact,
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.720]   they're support for eight-way multi-processing.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.920]   So they think they'll be quad-core two chips.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.760]   Yeah, they're going to use the server chips rather than desktop chips.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.800]   That would be a very fast machine.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.520]   It would crest and they are super, super fast.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.520]   That would be cool.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.080]   Apple has dumped, by the way, its last Mac with a CRT.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.800]   I didn't even know they were still selling these, the EMAX had a CRT monitor.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.920]   So now Apple's gone all LCD.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   Makes sense.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   I'm crying.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   Have you missed the CRTs?
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.160]   No, nobody misses it.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   Not really.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.760]   There are things about them I like, but they're the things I don't like that I appreciate
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.920]   LCDs all the more.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.760]   Microsoft is announced it's going to support OpenDoc.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.800]   I guess they've complete reverse on this.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   In fact, this is for--
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   They were forced.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.760]   Weren't they forced to do it by some government edicts?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   What's the deal?
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.880]   I think the story, I got the story from BitTech.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   You probably have a question.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.400]   It was a really impression they were forced.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.640]   Yeah, well, it was one of those things where it's like, if you don't support it, you're
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.280]   going to lose state contract.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.280]   Massachusetts.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.160]   That was one of them, I think.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   And so they're not forced by a court, but if they want to remain competitive, they've
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   got to do it, basically.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   Get this.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   This blows my mind.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.680]   They're Microsoft's making a plug-in.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   So there's PDF support.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.880]   There's XPS support, and there will be OpenDoc support.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.120]   And this is an open format, which means, finally, that you'll be able to read and write
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.760]   office files in things like OpenOffice.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.480]   They're going to host a plug-in on SourceForge, an open source plug-in on SourceForge.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.640]   Yes, the plug-in will be updated by the open source community rather than Microsoft.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   I don't know.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   This is the new Microsoft.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.360]   Is this because Bill Gates is retiring?
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   Wow.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.440]   I don't see what the big deal is.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.960]   I could always read these documents.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   Oh, no, no.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.200]   It was always difficult to do the reverse engineering of Office-- especially Word format files.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   I mean, they've done that.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.480]   The biggest problem I ever had was if you're using a document, then someone does a bunch
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.960]   of strike-throughs where everything you edit is logged down the right, and you can see
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.040]   what someone has deleted and added and all that.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.320]   The revision manager, yeah.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.120]   If you open one of those that's been edited in MS Office and you open it within OpenOffice
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.520]   format, it just won't do it.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   It will not do it.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   That's just good news.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.320]   I mean-- It opened it, but you don't realize you're missing a bunch of data.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.720]   But you won't actually get that data back by using this file format.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.880]   You'll just not have the option to have it in the first place.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.840]   It'll just be kind of a dumber format.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.800]   Yeah, but then if you save something because I got a document that I had like some lawyers
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.920]   looking over, and so I opened an OpenOffice and I made some changes and I didn't realize
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.960]   that I didn't see the initial changes, so I saved it and sent it back and it deleted
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   all the changes.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.800]   It was a confusing mess it took about a couple days almost until I realized--
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   Oh, that's a mess.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.360]   --OpenOffice, I shouldn't have been using it.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.000]   Could you use RTF all the time?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.160]   I mean, in a way, that's what RTF does.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.040]   It's kind of a dumber format that everybody understands.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   It's a Microsoft format.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   I don't know if this is--
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.960]   I can't picture an open document that I'm not having author--
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   --Rantations, let's cut out.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   --in addition.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   --that's kind of--
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.040]   But the nice thing is, is that because it's an open format that it'll be used on all of
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.080]   the word processor programs that people use.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.600]   So you won't run into questions like what David had.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   And that's the question.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.560]   Will Microsoft support all of the features in Office in this open doc plugin or will
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.560]   it be a stripped down feature set?
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   Ew.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.120]   If it's stripped down feature set, then big deal.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   They've done nothing.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   Right?
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   They need to support every feature.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.800]   I'm absolutely sure that's exactly what will happen.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   In which case, who cares?
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   I mean, that's what RTF does.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.480]   Well, why should they be spending their time, you know, for something that's not there?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:11.400]   You know, I'm not so anti-Microsoft that I accept the fact that they should be doing stuff
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.600]   that there's no reason for.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   I don't know.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:20.000]   Well, talking of Microsoft, how about the latest rumors of the fabled iPod killer?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.120]   Yeah, I thought it'd joke.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.360]   You wrote a great article about this, John, in which you pointed out that the key factor
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.480]   to the success of the iPod is its coolness.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.480]   And that's something Microsoft will never have.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   There's no way.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.040]   I mean, it's--and I adapt, but here's the question I always would ask.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.960]   I mean, let's face it, these MP3 players have been around forever.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.520]   And they came out a long time ago.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.720]   It wasn't until Apple actually did some national advertising, serious TV ads, that the thing
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.480]   became this dominant kind of creature.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.640]   You don't see Microsoft's not going to do that.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.240]   They're like a trade, you know, you're going to have a trade organization by comparison
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   to Apple.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   They're not a consumer company.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.880]   No consumer electronics experience.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.080]   They don't know how to do it.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.840]   It's laughable that they would even be a remote threat to Apple with this thing.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.080]   But they did it with the Xbox, though, didn't they?
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:13.920]   And the Xbox 360 and the rumors that the guy that headed up the 360 project, JL, is now
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.880]   the guy that's in charge of this iPod project.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.320]   And I think the feeling inside Microsoft, if all the rumors are true, is that if anybody
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.120]   can pull off this whole consumer electronics thing, it's the guy that helms the 360.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.760]   They won't give them the budget.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.800]   I'm really interested in this one.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.040]   Now, I don't know if Microsoft said this or this is just what leaked out and is what
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.320]   Engadget saying or whatever.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.800]   But according to the stories, to attract iPod users, Microsoft is going to let you download
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.240]   for free any songs that you've already bought from the iTunes music store.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   You know, they can't make the iTunes songs work on their player.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.080]   So they're going to do the next best thing.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.280]   According to Engadget, I find this very hard to believe they'll scan iTunes for purchase
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.320]   tracks and then automatically add them to your account.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.640]   I heard it was a limit of 20 songs.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   I find...
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640]   How many of these?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.120]   How many of these scan iTunes for what you've bought anyway?
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   Back for it.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.160]   You have to give me your account information, I would think.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.400]   Couldn't have just looked in your iTunes folder.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:20.760]   Yeah, but only for the stuff that identifies the Apple DMS.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.200]   This opens up an interesting possibility for a website where you can trade your iTunes.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.720]   Say you know what you've got an iPod.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.800]   You don't want to try this thing.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.600]   You want to trade the songs to somebody for yourself for five bucks.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.240]   You can have my whole file and have the feed down.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   Yeah, you can't do it.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.640]   See, this is what would happen.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.840]   The first thing would happen online.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.280]   Right, you can't do it though because the iTunes song has registered to your account
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   on iTunes.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.760]   It even has your email address embedded in the song.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   So you can't.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.240]   You can't do it.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.000]   The Inquirer, which is not necessarily the best source for this kind of thing, says that
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.760]   Microsoft's volish spyware will scan the libraries and add songs purchased from iTunes
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.920]   to your Microsoft account.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.080]   The difference is the track will be in WMA format now and you'll get them for free.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   I haven't heard that.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   So you heard it.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   It was only 20 songs.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   I haven't seen that, Robert.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   So that's what they're saying now.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.720]   That's what somebody told me.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   I could look around.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.360]   I don't even know how they would do it, to be honest with you.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:24.320]   That's the only thing they've got is a ridiculously blurry image.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   What's it going to look like?
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   Is it going to look?
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   Is it going to be?
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.240]   I think that image is of a UMPC is one of those mini PCs, isn't it?
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.400]   I think it's going to be a screen in the iPod.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.000]   It's going to be video.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.880]   It's video is supposed to be a bigger display.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.640]   And of course it's got Wi-Fi connectivity.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.200]   I like that Wi-Fi idea.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   So it would sync up.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.640]   They're saying social networking as well over Wi-Fi.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.640]   So what?
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.960]   I can get your playlists.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.880]   No, that just means a direct link to Myspace.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.640]   We've seen that.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.720]   There's a phone with Myspace.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.400]   Why don't you guys just write down all these features and send them into Wikipedia under
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   the word "clooge"?
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.080]   Toronto High School has expelled its Linux lab.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.840]   This is a really classic story.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.800]   The high school, the whole district has decided to go Windows.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.600]   They're doing Windows Classroom Migration Technology Initiative, the CTMI.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.960]   There's one lone teacher who has a little lab in his classroom that's all Linux.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.360]   They've asked him several times to get rid of it.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.320]   He goes to lunch.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.120]   And the head of the school-wide services for the district comes in and installs Windows
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.200]   on all the machines.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.520]   And the guy comes back from lunch.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.720]   And all his Linux machines are running Windows.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   That's pretty harsh.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   Isn't that cold?
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   I love that story.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.640]   Typical though, isn't it?
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   Oh whatever.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.760]   This is a clueless school district that says, "Well, it's Windows.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.920]   It's got to be good."
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   Everybody's using it.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.440]   Why would you use such an inferior technology?
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   Yes.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   How could it be any good?
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.600]   It's free.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.240]   That's just stupid.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.840]   This is the strangest story.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.120]   I think people should try to read this story because it's one of the weirdest stories I've
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   ever read.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.280]   It's almost hard to believe it happened.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.960]   Oh, if you've ever dealt with school boards over computers, I don't find it hard to believe.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.080]   I've been trying to get my local school board to use Macs or Linux for a long time.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.320]   And it's very difficult.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.960]   They're very much into Windows.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.120]   Well, it's really hard.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.280]   It's really nice down to support and they have no money to have anyone to maintain other
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.040]   than perhaps a teacher who is running that one particular lab.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040]   This one teacher says, "I'll keep it running.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   I'll do it.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   I'll do it."
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   Nice.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   No.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   It's all Windows.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.480]   But it's too bad because it's not the good message for the students.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.600]   Who's on this school board?
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Ted Stevens.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   [laughs]
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.480]   Windows is a series of tubes.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   It's tubes.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.640]   You think it's a truck?
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.600]   It's not some trucking tubes.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   Gosh.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.960]   I love the fact there's two shoots of that, man.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.920]   You could go and grab pictures of lots of little tubes lined up from an old valve amp
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.920]   or something.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.160]   He's done more, really, for the cause of net neutrality than anybody.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.600]   We've all been trying to promote this thing.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.040]   But all it took was Senator Stevens to say it's a series of tubes and that's it.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   Boom.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   It's all over.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   Genius.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:20.000]   Security expert Bruce Schneier in his log on July 7th pulls up a Navy patent for what
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   he says.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.920]   Sounds like a firewall.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.320]   The US Navy patenting firewalls.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.600]   It's not a patent yet, but it isn't patent application.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.400]   In a communication system having a plurality of networks, a method of achieving network
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.680]   separation between first and second networks is described.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.360]   Surely somebody already earns a patent on a firewall like Cisco or someone.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.680]   Well, you'd think, eh, it sounds like it'll just get blown out of the water.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   Here's a better story.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.040]   ABC looks to redistrict or restrict.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.880]   Oh, can you believe this?
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.240]   This guy is a yes, but it's a this is this shows you exactly how clueless these guys
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   are.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.360]   So the president of advertising sales for the ABC television network, one of the big
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:12.680]   three networks in the US says I would love it if the cable companies, the MSOs during
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.960]   the deployment of new DVRs are putting out there would disable the fast forward button.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.040]   See, nobody uses it.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.960]   He says, it says nobody cares.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.160]   He says, well, they're in the same business of selling ads as we are.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.520]   So they should be they should be before this.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.840]   And when people say, but don't you think that that would be hard for them to sell these
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.800]   DVRs if you couldn't fast forward through commercials?
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.880]   He said, no, no, no, that's not why people get DVR.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.200]   Well, they're not selling the DVRs.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.320]   The DVR comes with your Comcast subscription type of thing.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.720]   Yeah, but don't you think if you if you got a Comcast DVR that didn't have a fast forward
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.560]   button, you'd run by then I'd go and buy Tivo.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.880]   Well, then then Tivo should be all for it then.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.040]   Yeah, Tivo should be saying, yeah, go go go for it, Mr. Shaw.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.440]   Well, I think they're saying like, you know, we're basically raising a generation of people
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.960]   that don't watch ads on their TV.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.800]   So instead of addressing the issue, like making the ads better, making them less of
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.560]   truth and making them more effective.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.760]   No, just take out this able to fast forward button.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.560]   You know, this is like a hopeless situation for these guys because the fact of the matter
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.000]   is the people aren't watching coo or they're watching less and less commercials and the
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.840]   commercials are getting less and less effective because of it.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.400]   You can't force him to watch.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.400]   You cannot.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   No, but you know what?
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   You know what?
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.080]   It's all going to lead to the way I see it is it's going to and they're going to just
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.040]   have to do this and it was done in the 50s.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.920]   If you can watch some of those old TV shows on TV land, they embedded the commercials.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.280]   That's what we're going to do on podcasts, don't you think?
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.000]   You know, I think, yeah, I think embedding is what's going to happen and that's the,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.080]   you know, if you can't really fast forward because it thinks, you know, sneak up on you.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   I mean, that's what product placement's all about.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.440]   It's pretty hard to, you know, when a guy's drinking a Coca-Cola during the middle of
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.640]   a movie scene, I mean, you can't fast forward, fast it because it's also, they also make
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.160]   it so fast that they're making a quick time to respond to it and make it of interest.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.840]   If you, if you put commercials in that people are products that people are interested in
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.040]   buying, they're going to listen.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   It's of information.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.440]   I think that's, you know, there's, I don't want, I can't remember what the number is.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.480]   Something like $80 billion a year spent on advertising on the networks.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.040]   This money is going to be heading towards us.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.800]   I think towards podcasts, towards other non-traditional forms of advertising where, you know, if you
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.400]   buy this podcast, you buy a very specific audience.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.960]   We're going to, we're starting next week.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   Dell is going to be starting it to advertise on, you know, it starts next week.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.880]   It's official.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.880]   And it's going to be an obtrusive.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.400]   If there's no way I could put a Dell commercial in the middle of the thing, but we're going
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.520]   to encourage you in it now.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520]   Don't you like Dell, John?
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.280]   I think Dell's a fabulous computer company.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.320]   And that, not you mentioned, there's a Dell story floating around on our list.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.920]   Well, and I'll be honest, I wouldn't, you know, accept, you know, I'd be very, I've
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.080]   already turned down a number of advertisers that I didn't think fit to it.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:56.360]   And I think that the key for advertisers is to find, put your ads somewhere where people
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.680]   want to hear your pitch.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.000]   Otherwise, you're wasting your time.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.960]   You're talking about this concept PC from Dell?
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.240]   Yeah, I think, you know, we should probably talk about it next week.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.680]   I don't know if they're really, are they selling it?
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.360]   This thing looks like a boom box.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   I don't know what it is.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   It's a cool thing.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.080]   I mean, they've made a couple of weird looking machines recently.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.160]   They obviously have somebody that's the alien.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.640]   Well, they acquired alienware.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   Or the alienware.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   Yeah, that's what it is, obviously.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.080]   There's something, like, go ahead.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.120]   Yeah, it really is a concept.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.200]   It's like, you know, the little...
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.480]   They're going to sell it.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   Bobbles on top and you're basically like, oh, I can pull out my graphics card and just
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:34.200]   slot in a new one or I can just pull out this, you know, little, you know, chassis extension
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.480]   which contains my processor.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   It's a modular computer.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.920]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   Why not?
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   It doesn't need power in it.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.000]   I think it's going to end up with one of these things like, you know, I can just place my
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.600]   phone on my desk and it automatically recharges it.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.720]   Don't you think it'd be cool though if we're all hot, swappable?
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.880]   Could you make it hot, swappable so you can just...
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.040]   You don't have to turn the computer off.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   You just swap modules in.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.160]   Oh, no, because you don't have incremental upgrades.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   You never have a slow...
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   Too much.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.560]   ...and it's an architecture paradigm shift.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.160]   You could do it with the hard drives.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.800]   And servers have hot, swappable hard drives.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.440]   You just plug them in while the server is running.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.040]   Well, that now, don't we?
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   So I think that's what they need to do.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040]   Make these...
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   Look at this.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   I don't know if they're going to sell them.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:16.360]   Well, I'm sorry, but I think that we're overlooking here is the possibility that maybe concept
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.000]   computers, which they've...
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   They made a run at over the years.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.920]   Intel's done it.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.440]   Could be like concept cars in Detroit where you actually get to see some pretty cool things
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.240]   that maybe they make one or two of.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:32.040]   I think that was always the idea from when an Intel did these design forums where they
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.720]   would have crazy...
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   It was exactly like that.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.880]   It was like concept cars.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   This though sounds more real.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   I don't know.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.240]   This is an article from BitTech also.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.960]   So will you probably know more about this than we do, but they're going to call it the
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   XCS.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.040]   It'll be an Intel ATI lineup, they think.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.480]   Maybe chord II.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   I don't know if this...
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.720]   Is this picture what they're planning to sell?
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.440]   I think it's a rendering.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.240]   I think it's one of those things like this is what we'd quite like to do and maybe it'll
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.280]   happen in like two years time.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.200]   And would anybody buy it if we did?
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.600]   Are you looking at the tubular looking?
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.520]   And it's totally tubular.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:18.320]   And they said it's designed by Matthew Ritter, who was the Alienware guy, right?
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   We used to do this on the screensavers.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.440]   Didn't we bring in people with the concept PCs and stuff and show...
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.800]   Well they'd bring in people that did their own custom mods.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.880]   We did the mods, but I think we had some concept PCs as well.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   Really?
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.280]   I mean, the most I've ever seen is someone take a motherboard and build out something
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.040]   that some combination that I mean, I don't think anyone was writing up their own drivers
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   for things.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.040]   Well, I have to say...
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.040]   And it's seen before.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.560]   As yet, I've never seen one of these concept PCs actually go into production.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   So maybe...
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.480]   Ah, well, I will back at...
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.960]   Well back at CES this year, in fact, Delonveiled a concept of a 20 inch notebook.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   Oh, they're so...
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.000]   That's a tangible thing.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   They did...
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   They're shipping that.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   You're gonna buy it.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.280]   Yeah, that is the goofiest thing ever.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   That's one anyway.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.360]   You're right, that one made it.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.200]   Maybe it shouldn't have.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.320]   Elio, you mentioned screensavers.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.120]   You know that there's a bunch of old episodes up on YouTube or Google now.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   Have you...
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   You're familiar with that?
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   Are you...
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.280]   Somebody wrote me a note saying that you're making a dollar on each one of those.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.840]   You're the one that's posting them.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.080]   No, first of all, they're not for sale.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.200]   If they were, they would be immediately taken down.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   We are selling call for help, the Canadian version of call for help for a buck, but that's
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.400]   where that story came from.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.960]   I don't get a buck for each of them.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.160]   Google gets 30 cents, 35 cents.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.720]   For anybody that myths screensavers, by virtue of being geographically convenient.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.840]   I don't think it's back anywhere near all of them.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   Talk about 2004's news.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.400]   It's nowhere near all the episodes, but there's some fun things.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.320]   You remember this, David, where Kevin blew up the computer with Thermite?
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.560]   Well, half the reason I'm seeing all these stories is because Dig put up their whole video
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   section.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   I'm seeing them too.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   That's right.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.600]   And so, of course, obviously a lot of the Dig users, or a lot of the original Dig users
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.760]   were fans of stuff like the screensaver.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.320]   So they're the ones that are like, probably even submitting half of these videos that they've
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.360]   captured themselves and putting that up on YouTube and saying, "Oh, here's this cool
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.360]   video."
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:21.600]   Now, you know, G4 does own the rights to that name and to the show and could stop it.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.120]   They could do a DMCA request and stop it.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.400]   We have to pay them to call the show call for help.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.360]   And I've been telling the Canadians, "Stop, why are you paying them?
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.920]   Isn't G, Comcast, G4, own part of the Canadian broadcast?"
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.000]   They own a third of them.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   They own a third of the company.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Well, then, who's...
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.440]   Why don't you stop the license from them?
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.000]   Are they paying themselves then?
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.800]   Well, they get a third of it back.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   Okay.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   Or something.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   Well, that's kind of weird.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   But they don't get all of it.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   You know, you have to license this stuff.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   And apparently it's not that cheap.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.680]   But I keep telling them Canadians, you know, they do it because I think because they're
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.080]   one third owner.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   I keep telling them.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.400]   Call it call for Leo.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   It doesn't matter what it's called.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.640]   Why are you paying for that name?
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.040]   How about Leo for help?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   That's the name.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   Help Leo.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   Help with help.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   Leo, help.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.840]   You know who was a little upset was Google.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   I wanted a little help here from Miriam Webster.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.160]   It's always an issue when your brand becomes a generic word.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.920]   Kleenex and Xerox sleep to mind and both companies.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   Popsicle.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   Popsicle.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920]   Google.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   I mean, it is.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   It's a lowercase G. Google.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   I'll Google that.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.800]   Let me Google before your daughter goes out on a date with somebody.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.160]   You Google them.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.680]   So they're worried that Google's going to go to the way that Frisbee?
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:43.640]   Well, Miriam Webster is including the word Google lowercase G. It's a verb in their dictionary.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.040]   I liked the other ones they were putting in there.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.240]   There are a couple of ones that including himbo, which I thought was great.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   What's himbo?
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   I never heard that.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   I've never heard him before now.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   It's the most obvious man.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.040]   So it's a bimbo, a himbo, yeah?
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.240]   It's a bimbo, but a bloke.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.640]   I think the Miriam Webster people are going to the wrong bars.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.040]   I never heard that.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.760]   I never heard it either.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.000]   I guess in England you say Hoover instead of Vacuum?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Absolutely.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.560]   Because we don't do that here.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.080]   But apparently that's another example of a brand name becoming a verb.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.160]   I think that's it should be in the dictionary.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   It's absolutely--
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.640]   Has that ever happened before?
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   What happened?
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.440]   I mean, where a company's trademark name becomes a word in the dictionary.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.640]   I think so.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.640]   I think Kleenex.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   There's got to be tons of it.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   I think Popsicle.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.640]   I think Xerox.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   I think Hoover.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.040]   I'm sure Xerox is in the dictionary.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.040]   Absolutely.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.840]   Xerox hates it.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.920]   They're always filing lawsuits against people who say Xerox.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Oh, Xerox.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   You did.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   You photocopied it.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   Xerox.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:43.920]   They try.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   And I'm sure Google will.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   Oh, and here's another word.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.640]   Besides himbo, mouse potato.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.840]   I don't know about that.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   I don't know what that means.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   I've never heard that one either.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:49.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:25.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:39.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:46.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:53.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   I think they're talking about Roddie.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   Can you play movies on it or is it just for data disks?
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.840]   I don't know.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:13.840]   I bet you can read it but you can't play the movie back.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   That would go to John's assertion that they're prevented from doing that.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.840]   What would keep it from doing that?
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   It doesn't have the proper decoder?
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   In order to play the movie, you'd have to have the D-C-S-S or whatever that.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.840]   Licensing.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.840]   The license.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.840]   You'd have to have a license for the decryption.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   Well, it looks like a device that has a lot of content.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   I bet you read the data and I bet you're not.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.840]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.840]   It just sends a corner where I see it.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   It just finds a way of reading it.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.840]   This doesn't mean that they can produce a commercial product.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.840]   It's obvious that that's what's going to have to happen one of these days.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   But I think it's going to be a ways to go because it seems to me that somebody
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   should have, especially Samsung who promised that they were going to do this and then
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   they said they weren't going to do it, they would have done it.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.840]   It seems to me this is going to happen because not enough people are going to buy the thing.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   Finally, Sony and Panasonic and Toshiba will have to come to the table and say,
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   "Oh, yeah, a couple years though."
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.840]   There's no incentive for Samsung to do it right now though because it would just kill
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.840]   sales of their current player and it would probably be on some deal.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.840]   The incentive will be when only a thousand people or ten thousand, whatever that number
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   is buy these things and the rest of the world says, "I don't want it."
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   And I think that's what's going to happen.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   How about prices will fall eventually?
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.840]   I still wouldn't buy it.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   I mean, the media itself is already pretty cheap.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.840]   It's 20 bucks for most Blu-ray movies.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.840]   Why do I buy a recorder?
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   I buy 30 for most HD DVD.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   I buy a writer for my PC, but I'm not going to buy an HD DVD player or a Blu-ray DVD player.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   What if they were 99 bucks, Leo?
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   99 bucks.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.840]   So you don't buy one of each?
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   I don't think consumers will do that.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   Yeah, it would for 99 bucks.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.840]   I bet not.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   I think they would.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   If they have a DVD HD screen, they would.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   I mean, I would.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   Maybe.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   I think they resist the idea of having to figure out, "Okay, I'm going to go buy this
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   disc.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.840]   Which player do I put it in?"
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:04.840]   I don't know.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.840]   Maybe they will, but I just seem that that seems like that's the kind of...
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   You don't have to be pretty cheap.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:15.120]   Well, I still like the idea of the one cup that I guess is a Warner and maybe somebody else
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   thinking about it.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   Oh, you flip it over.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.840]   Selling DVDs because people still buy those and then you flip it over.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.840]   You have your HD DVD and it's not a bad idea.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.840]   I think it was a great idea.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.840]   It's going to take something like that.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.840]   Now, what do you think about this?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   Google Checkout.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:29.840]   Have you guys ever played with Google Checkout?
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.840]   It's a new payment plan from Google.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.840]   Kind of like PayPal.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   Who accepts it?
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.840]   I think a lot of people will accept it.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.840]   It's a better deal for vendors.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.840]   They've already got LL Bean, I think.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   They've got some big vendors.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.840]   Of course, it's a chicken and egg until consumers start using it, but I use it.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   You trust it's cheaper for the retailer.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   I think credit cards.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   I mean, it's just like PayPal.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   It's a safe payment.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   It's PayPal.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.840]   Because like the big vendors, you don't do PayPal.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.840]   You just pay with a credit card.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.560]   Well, they'll have what there's incentive because if you have the Google Checkout button on
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.840]   your page, then Google gives you what happens with the AdWords.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.200]   I haven't seen any yet, but I'm told that the AdWords will have a Google button, Google
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.160]   Checkout button in the ad.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.560]   So there is some incentive.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.880]   You get a little bit better ad kind of visibility if you do that.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.160]   Let me search for something.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.680]   Cargo pants.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.840]   You wear cargo pants?
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   Oh, yeah, don't you?
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.000]   They got lots of pockets.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.920]   No, I don't see any.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.720]   I thought you'd be looking for a utility kill.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   You still have one?
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.480]   I don't have a utility kill.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   That's bad.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.000]   Patrick got me to wear that once and I never worn it again.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   I'll tell you.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Because I went to kill?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   But it killed.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.480]   We had a kill day on the screen savers.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.040]   I mean, I think I walked past you guys during that.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.760]   I walked past your stage and it was kind of freaky.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.560]   It's really freaky because Martin did not look good in the kill.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.560]   Back me up on this, right?
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.840]   David, he did not look good.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.440]   He really should not be wearing it, especially the black socks and the wingtips.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.960]   There's a photo on the web pretty easily findable of everyone from that day.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.080]   Well, I wasn't wearing any underwear because Patrick told me that's how you're supposed
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.080]   to do it.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.120]   I'm not sure you get to a nice spot.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.240]   There's a straight line where I can't get to a straight line.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:27.340]   And then at one point I got so giddy I spin and what I didn't realize is those pleats
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.440]   really catch the wind.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   You don't want to hear anymore.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.440]   You're making it sick.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   Can we go to?
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:41.280]   I wanted to ask David what you made of this and the thing about the friends to getting
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.560]   a patent on social networking.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   What did I say?
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:50.360]   Friendster got a patent on social networking.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:55.440]   This, you know, Friendster may actually have some value if this patent holds.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.080]   They were awarded on June 27th.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.840]   It's very general.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.520]   It basically says it covers online social networks.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.960]   And if this patent works, they can go to dig.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.960]   They can go to links to.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.080]   They got all these other people and say, hey, pay up.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.040]   We want a little license fee for our social networking flicker.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.160]   I mean, just think of how valuable that patent could be.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.520]   I don't know what to say, but I haven't read it.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:27.000]   But I mean, half of the Web 2.0 websites are based on being able to have some of this
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   interactivity.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.160]   I just started my blog over to a beta of Vox, which is a new service from the six of
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.040]   our people that guys do movable type and type.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.400]   It's a really nice blog.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.960]   But one of the key features of it is social networking.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.080]   You have friends that you link to and stuff.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.360]   They'd have to pay a license fee too.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.280]   I mean, it's the URL, Leo.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.480]   V-O-X.com.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.040]   And my blog is LeoVille.V-O-X.com.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.520]   Or just click the blog link on any of my pages that goes there now.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   Oh, it's not.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   It's nice software.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.520]   I mean, they have ads on.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   They have ads on.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.520]   But it's not blogging software.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   You wouldn't want to use it, John.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.000]   And I think anybody who's a professional blogger probably wouldn't.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   But it's kind of to compete with blogger.com for a free e-z.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   It's a quality blogger.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.600]   And it's very simple.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.400]   But I like this social idea.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.040]   I think that a lot of sites can benefit from the kind of social networking.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.760]   I certainly hope Friendster, if they decide to enforce this patent, doesn't get creepy
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   about it.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.280]   Well, you know who they make a bunch of money from?
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   MySpace.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.520]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.000]   What was it?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   They have to have specifics.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.440]   I mean, there has to be something specific in the patent that you can show that people
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   are infringing.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.400]   They don't think you can't patent an idea.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.080]   And so there has to be a mechanism.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.560]   There has to be some technology.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.280]   And so they have to only go after people that they can explain.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   That are doing this thing.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.920]   And it could be software technology.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.240]   I'm not saying it's not that.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.640]   But it can't be just just, you know, just anything.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.440]   I mean, there's been these kinds of things like MySpace have been around for a while.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.440]   Oh, here's the deal.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   Here's the deal.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.080]   I've been looking for the description of the patent.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:10.000]   The Friendster patent's main claim applies to networks that limit relationships to a certain
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   number of degrees of separation.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.760]   For example, you can't connect to somebody who doesn't know somebody who doesn't know
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.760]   somebody who doesn't know somebody who doesn't know.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.760]   Okay, that sounds just like LinkedIn.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.760]   That's LinkedIn.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   That's LinkedIn.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.480]   But that's not a whole bunch of the other ones.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   It's not MySpace.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:28.040]   Because if you know, basically on MySpace, anybody who connects to anybody on MySpace
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.040]   is your friend.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.200]   I mean, I have like 36 million friends on MySpace.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:37.360]   I mean, it's pretty easy to do.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.240]   So I got your new blog up here.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   I don't know.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.600]   I don't see where the social networking is.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.000]   But what the heck is this?
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   What's what?
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.880]   Oh, it's just I'm playing with it.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.520]   You know me, I'm not a blogger.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.640]   Oh, that's just some video.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.640]   I'm not a blogger.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.640]   I just play with these.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.320]   I play with this software to see how it works.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.880]   But it's very easy to upload videos.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.800]   Mo blog pictures from your camera.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   I was just giving you maybe just some new video.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.160]   It was a happy Canada Day video.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   That's all.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.480]   Yeah, what's a happy Canada Day?
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.800]   Canada Day is July 1st.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:13.520]   And I was just celebrating because I'm an honorary Canadian.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.120]   I spend one quarter of my life in Canada.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.240]   And you're spending a lot of time up there.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.640]   I like Canada.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   It's very...
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   Everybody likes Canada.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.640]   The climate's salubrious.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:25.320]   Well, it's not that bad in Vancouver.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.960]   Yeah, Vancouver is beautiful.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.480]   You have a house just over the border, don't you?
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.120]   I'm going to Victoria quite a bit.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.960]   I'm going to Victoria in August on the cruise.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.040]   Is that anything you recommend in Victoria?
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.600]   In Victoria, Victoria is probably the best city on the west coast.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.160]   I mean, I don't think anybody who's ever been there doesn't enjoy it.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.200]   It's a small, a small, compact little place.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:48.720]   But it's got like a little Chinatown and it's got like a little theatre district.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.200]   It's got the hotel.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   It's an amazing place.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.240]   And it's got the gorgeous capital building.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.840]   I want to have a very, very pleasant place.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.840]   I want to have...
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   Well, you've got to go to Rogers Chocolates.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.520]   Oh, all right.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.440]   You don't have to convince me of that.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.840]   Is that Roger with an apostrophe S like Roger Chang's chocolates or is it...
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   It's just R-O-G-E-R-S.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.440]   I don't have to convince me of that.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.840]   I'll be there.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.320]   Stephen Hawking posted a question on Yahoo Answers.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.880]   Do you think Yahoo paid him to do this?
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.720]   I think they must have.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   The question...
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.720]   You can post these questions on Yahoo Answers and then you get answers, right?
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.960]   His question, how can the...
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.760]   How can the human rights survive?
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   That's awesome.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:32.920]   The next hundred years.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:33.920]   And then...
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   But what's funny is any...
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.400]   I guess any moron can post an answer to it because the number one answer is...
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.880]   They'll live underground.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.560]   Number two answer is get rid of nuclear weapons.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.320]   Number three answer.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.320]   One day at a time.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:51.240]   Hey, I think the number two answer is the best one right there.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.240]   What's that?
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.240]   Get rid of nuclear weapons?
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   Yeah, you can't.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   To start.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.720]   There's 21,000 answers to Stephen Hawking's query.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   How much...
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   Doesn't Google Answers work?
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   You have to put money.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.880]   You have to put money forward to whoever answers your question.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.360]   Yeah, but this is Yahoo Answers.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   Oh, it's Yahoo.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.320]   I thought you said Google Answers.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.920]   They give you money to ask the question.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.440]   I'm sure they paid him a thousand bucks or something.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   Why would he...
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   Do you think...
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.440]   Oh, no, no.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.760]   I'm saying like Google Answers, you pay money to the person that provides you with the answer.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.560]   I think Yahoo Answers works differently, I'm not sure.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.600]   Welcome to Yahoo Answers, a new way to find and share information.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.480]   So I guess you asked the question and then anybody can answer it.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.880]   And then everyone just says 42, 42, 42, 42, 42.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.560]   I kind of doubt Hawking would do it for money.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   I don't know why.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   Why would he do it?
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.560]   It's clearly a publicity ploy and it's worked, by the way.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560]   Isn't he?
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.040]   I mean, he could probably work in his book or something.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040]   Nothing.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.200]   There's nothing, there's no plug here or anything.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.720]   Maybe just looking for an audience.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   I have a guess.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   I have a guess.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.720]   What?
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720]   Girls.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   Girls, it must be chicks.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   You can meet some chicks.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.120]   The guy is like a girl.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120]   I know.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120]   Girl, the hound.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.200]   Well, no one's in fact.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200]   Alright.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200]   That's awesome.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200]   I've heard that too.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200]   More power to him, right?
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200]   I concur.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   Really?
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.360]   How can he be a ladies man?
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360]   To read it.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360]   We haven't seen the biography.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   We haven't seen the biography.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.360]   We haven't seen the biography.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   We haven't seen the biography.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.440]   But he's had when people ask him about that topic.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.240]   I am all ladies and men.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240]   Yeah, he has.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.080]   And that's a good way to meet women.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.920]   Cartoon women.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   Did you see the hound?
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.360]   No, there was something.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.000]   There was something I was just looking at a video the other day when somebody caught.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.120]   I think it was even on the John Storcher or some place.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.800]   Or maybe it was Colbert.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.720]   And they showed him, you know, eyeball on somebody with a leer that was like, "Whoa!"
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.840]   No, he's got Lou Gehrig's disease.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.440]   He can't control his leer.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   No.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   Oh, he has ALS.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440]   He has ALS.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.360]   Well, I understand that.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.800]   He was on Star Trek too.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.880]   Amanda Cogdon is going to go work for him as a nurse.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.880]   Oh, God.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.600]   I don't know.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.320]   There's muscular dystrophy that he has.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   Is that?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   I thought he has ALS.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.320]   No, I'm pretty sure it is.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.960]   The fact is that he's lived longer than most people with it.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960]   It's kind of unusual.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   Look, he's brilliant physicists.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.120]   You know, we've all read his book.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.320]   We're as big as fans.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.840]   This book is probably the most owned and the least read book of all time.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.120]   The brief history of time.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.920]   Everybody owns a copy, but how many people actually read it?
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.680]   You can't read it.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.120]   I have one with pictures.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   I have one with pictures.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   It's really, it's easier to read.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   Comic book version.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.240]   I still can't figure it out.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   Let's see.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.360]   Any other stories before we lightning lashes, iPod packing teenager?
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.840]   Ha ha.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.520]   That's perfect response.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   That's all we need to say.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.720]   Oh, it's the earbuds were the lightning rod or something.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720]   Guess what?
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.800]   You get hit by lightning when wearing wires going into your head.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.360]   That thing's going to happen.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.760]   That's probably going to happen.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.840]   We didn't mention with the Google checkout that one of the funny things that happened
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.000]   is that eBay refuses to use it.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.600]   That's right.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.480]   They have a safe payments policy.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.200]   And you know, you can't until they add a payer to your safe payments policy.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.360]   If you have a safe payments plan, you can't use it.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.800]   They had to change it though to accepted payments because they didn't want to apply
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.080]   that Google was unsafe.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.080]   So they've changed.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.200]   So they've said because Google doesn't have a substantial historical track record of providing
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.000]   safe and reliable financial and/or banking related services.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.200]   And Google meanwhile says this isn't a beta.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.040]   We've been doing this for a long time.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.400]   I don't think there's any reason that eBay has to knuckle under to Google.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   No.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400]   No.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   It's a competitor with PayPal.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400]   I guess that's why they wouldn't do it.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.840]   Although, I just think it's funny that they changed it from safe payments to accepted payments
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.480]   so that there would be a way they would take a lawsuit.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.160]   They can always argue the security side of things too.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   That it's insecure?
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.000]   Well, just to make sure it's like my bank for the longest time, every time there was
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.640]   a browser upgrade, you just never suddenly could log into your account if you had an
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.200]   older browser or using an alternative browser.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.400]   And they finally wised up that.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.720]   And then maybe it was partially to keep little stick at Google for their thing.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.240]   But I think it's also just a valid thing.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.840]   It's like they didn't know how secure Google's current, you know, payment system is.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   So you don't want to just open up.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.120]   It's just a little too close to the PayPal for comfort.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.720]   One last story to get John's blood pressure up before we wrap this thing up.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.600]   The Department of Defense is monitoring email messages from college students who are planning
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.840]   protests against the war in Iraq and against the military's don't ask, don't tell policy.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.480]   According to surveillance reports released last month.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.000]   Are they insuring our First Amendment rights?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.640]   They are protecting.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   They are protecting.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.640]   I don't know.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.480]   Making sure every word gets through, nothing gets lost.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.360]   While the Department has previously acknowledged monitoring protests on campus as national security
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.320]   threats, it was not until recently that evidence surfaced showing that the Department was also
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.840]   monitoring all emails submitted by campus sources.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.200]   And more reason to use PGP.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   Geeze.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.400]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.600]   What happened to the right to protest in this country?
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.600]   Come on.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600]   You still have the right to?
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.760]   They've always been doing this to protest.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   Keep an eye on it.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.640]   They take movies and then that's where I identify them.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.320]   And I don't know what the point is.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.080]   It's not like, you know, I've seen people, you know, lose their jobs or anything over
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.520]   this or the, I guess if you work for the government, it's probably not a good idea.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:36.760]   There's a picture somewhere of me on the front page of the Santa Cruz Sentinel in a war
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.600]   anti-war protest.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   When was this?
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600]   In 1972.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.280]   1972 wasn't the war over by then?
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.440]   Oh, heck no.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.720]   That was the mining of the High Fong Harbor that we were interested in.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   That's before my time.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.720]   What were you doing in '72?
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720]   All right.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720]   It's the problem.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   Who knows?
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   You don't remember.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.400]   If you do remember, you weren't having any fun.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.400]   All right.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.400]   Much of a blur.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.160]   Any other stories, any other tweets want to cover?
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.960]   It's too hot for us to do a long show today.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   I'm burning up.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960]   Seriously.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   Oh, it's a hot day.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.160]   I drove through the Central Valley today on the way to drive my kid to camp.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.440]   It was 106 degrees in Sacramento.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   Ugh.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   Awful.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.760]   I think the only thing that I've got is to just discover the photo of all you guys in
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   the kilts.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   That's not cool.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.440]   Yeah, I'm going to get that picture and blog it.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.320]   Somewhere there's a video of me spinning in my kilts.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.120]   I stopped in the nick of time.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.240]   That's all I can say.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240]   It moves.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.240]   Yes, as it were.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.240]   It did move up very quickly.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.520]   I just warn anybody who wears a kilt.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.280]   No spinning.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.040]   Don't get giddy and start spinning.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040]   Thank you.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040]   It's a pleasure.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   Yes.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.120]   Congratulations to Italy on their win in the World Cup.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.400]   Thank you very much for joining us.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.840]   Will Harris all the way from Great Britain?
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.720]   It is where it is now 2.18 in the morning, I believe.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.880]   I'm getting together.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.040]   Please go to bed.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:08.200]   Everybody should read the reviews at bit-tech.net of Conro and Merrim and those.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.840]   You'll actually have numbers out when the 14th.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.840]   14th next Sunday.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.840]   All right.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840]   We will be right there.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.840]   Well, that's actually the 16th.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.600]   Oh, maybe I'm lying there.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.240]   I thought they said the 14th they'd be out.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.000]   Well, anyway, keep your eye peeled for them.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.840]   Those numbers will be.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.840]   Cripe's.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   Cripe's they'll be amazing.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.480]   And it'll be a cork.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.480]   They'll be super-
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480]   A worker.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:36.720]   Dvorak.org/blog to see pictures of Martin, Sergeant, and a kilt.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   I've got them right here.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.800]   We'll send them over.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.920]   And all sorts of other stuff.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   You put those on there.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.840]   You're going to get blocked again by the anti-porn filters.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840]   Maybe.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840]   Maybe not.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   It's not exactly what you're wearing.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840]   Yours is like blue.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.920]   It looks really more like a skirt.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   Please.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.000]   We prefer to call them kilts.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.160]   To DLTV and Robert Herron, it's representative.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.560]   We thank you for being here, Robert.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.560]   Hey, my pleasure.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.760]   What's coming up on DL.TV?
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.520]   Anything exciting in the next couple of shows?
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.120]   That's all we do in this week.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.560]   You know, I'm not sure.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.400]   We're in the middle of building the new studio.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.160]   So that's been cutting into Showtime lately.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.160]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:19.840]   That's redecorating with steel and rust-simulating paint.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.520]   Would you have a spiral staircase to nowhere?
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.840]   I don't think we're going to.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   You know, maybe.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.000]   But that'd be a great homage, though.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.320]   You know, it is still around.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.840]   I know the guy who has the staircase.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.920]   I'm trying to have this 57-inch LCD.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.360]   I just want to stick in behind us and use that as like a backdrop.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360]   Absolutely.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.360]   Absolutely.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.360]   Final on that thing.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.360]   With that.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.840]   Oh, I recorded it in HD.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.360]   It was beautiful.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.320]   Every blade of grass.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.280]   Every penalty kick.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:58.640]   David Prager Revision3.com, where someday soon new products will emerge.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.560]   Every time David's on, he says, "Yeah, any minute now.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   I know how you go."
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   Oh, come on.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560]   I was on last week and then I hadn't been on for a minute.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   I know how you go.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.640]   I'm previous to that for about a month or more.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.280]   I'm actually getting hate mail now because I haven't released the new site.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   People are actually mad at me.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.880]   That's why you're doing announced stuff.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   Well, I know.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.480]   I shouldn't have said anything.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   Everything takes longer than you think.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.720]   When's the new site coming, Leo?
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.720]   No.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.520]   Well, I could say it now because it's good that we were holding off for the Dell campaign.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.640]   The Dell campaign and the new site are launching simultaneously on Thursday.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.640]   And there will be some bumps.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.440]   The new site still has a little, you know, few problems with it.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.440]   Is it Drupal?
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.440]   Yeah, still Drupal.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.640]   It's really, it's going to be very nice.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640]   Very cool.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   Very.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   It's working fine with all the old data into it.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.400]   We just have to make the port over.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:47.840]   And unlike Kevin as Dig, I don't have a team of crack engineers to do this.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.520]   So I'm not going to say nine o'clock in the morning on Thursday.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520]   I have no idea.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.440]   Did you see their new about page on Dig?
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.240]   You can see the little pictures of everyone.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240]   Oh, that's good.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.280]   I needed to do that, I think.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.800]   I needed to do that.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800]   So yeah, that's in that.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:08.600]   And the next time we can join, we will actually have a commercial from Dell in the mix.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.000]   So I'm very happy about that.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.040]   And you know what that means, guys?
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   Paychecks.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.480]   So I'll be asking all of you for your social security numbers.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.120]   We will do that off the air.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   Another tweet.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.120]   It's in the can.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   Yeah, the Twitter army.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   I really don't.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:35.120]   Microsoft, who food it?
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   The night is a good moment.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.400]   You're supposed to get to know what we're trying to reap after a ride on our other state
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.400]   of work.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.400]   So I just crips.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.400]   Crips is good.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   I tell my kids that.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   We use it all the time.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.400]   I tell my kids that.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.400]   Dang.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.400]   It's a dang.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.400]   Well, those are kind of crips.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.400]   Crips is actually pretty.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   Sounds like something to know.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   It sounds ceserias.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   You should go with blimey.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   Blimey.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.400]   All right.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.400]   Do it in the Twitter.
