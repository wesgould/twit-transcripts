[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   the old guy show.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I guess, Jason, you're not an old guy yet.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   >> Hello, Leo.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   >> Actually, I'm pretty sure Jason is younger than I am.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> Also --
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   >> Also --
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   >> -- just an old soul.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   >> Speaking of old guys --
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   >> 37.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> 37, yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Anybody under 40 is it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So we got a little balance on the panel, thanks to you and,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Patrick.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Also, Doug, can you just join us?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> You should be coming up.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   >> Hold on a second.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Let me say hi to Doug.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   >> Hey, Leo, how are you?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> Doug, okay, from IT Conversations.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> And I'm the oldest one of all all bit.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> Well, maybe not.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> I'm some old guys on it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   There's some old parts of this.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Maybe Dwight.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I'm 59.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> Can you all hear Mr. K?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> Yeah, he sounds good, actually.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   He sounds better than Calicannis.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> You know why?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   >> That's just genetic.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> That's because he's --
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   >> He's a better voice than Calicannis.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> He's down the road.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Jason's in Sydney.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> That's right.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's early in the morning there.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Hey, by the way, in breaking news story, BBC News coming out
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   right now, apparently Microsoft's mowing a fresh Yahoo deal as we
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   speak.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, I've been watching this on Tech meme.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's bumbling up.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But they say they wouldn't consider an acquisition anymore.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Now, this has come from the Carl Icahn.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Carl Icahn announced last week that he was going to replace the
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yahoo board with his own hand-picked people or tried to get the --
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   you'd have to get the stockholders to do that, including Mark Cuban,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   which cracks me up.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> Yeah, I think -- I wrote about this in market watching.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It's a very good column if you want to read my take on it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I think the whole idea was to put Mark Cuban as the new CEO and
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   then sell off the company in bits and pieces over the next six
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   months before the basketball season began again.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   >> Press release came out today.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Microsoft doesn't do Sunday.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Press release is very often.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   This must be a first.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Microsoft announced it is continuing to explore and pursue its
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   alternatives to improve and expand that they like, you know,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   divide and conquer and golf and devour.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They like those -- what is that?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Where you do two- >> Embrace and extend.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> Embrace and extend.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Why is -- it doesn't that come from the old English jurisprudence
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   when they had French and English and they had to use two words in
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   legal jargon so that people would understand both?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   >> I think it stems from the -- >> Sees and desist.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   >> I think it actually stems from the popularity of the --
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   >> For Boston?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> Half and half that was very popular in Seattle in the late
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   '70s and early '80s.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> I believe it comes from Cockney-Rimingslang.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Anyway, they've done it twice in one sentence.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   No, three times.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Listen to this.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Microsoft announced it is continuing to explore and pursue its
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   alternatives to improve and expand its online services and
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   advertising business.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   This is the quote, "In light of development since the withdrawal
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   of the Microsoft proposal to acquire Yahoo, Microsoft announced
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   it is continuing to --" I already said all that.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Microsoft is considering and has raised.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You know, they've got the really kind of the low-level flax in
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the day because it's Sunday.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> So what's the news in there?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> Microsoft is considering and has raised with Yahoo an alternative
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   that would involve a transaction with Yahoo but not an acquisition
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   of all of Yahoo.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Microsoft is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of Yahoo
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   at this time but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   depending on future developments and discussions that may take
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   place with Yahoo or discussions with shareholders of Yahoo or
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Microsoft or with other third parties.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   There can be, of course, no assurance that any transaction
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   will result from these discussions.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> So go ahead and Microsoft, according to Todd Bishop's
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Microsoft blog over at the Seattle PI, they are not talking
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   to Carl Icahn.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   >> This is not part of the Carl Icahn bid.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> Well, they're -- well, probably it's one of the reasons why
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   they need to do it but they're not talking to Icahn.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   In other words, Icahn is not involved in this.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   This is directly between Microsoft and Yahoo.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   >> Yeah, Icahn is just a middleman.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   >> I can tell you what.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   >> He's a catalyst.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> This is going to be --
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   >> Jason, you were the guy who said this deal would be done
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   in one day.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   What's going on?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   >> Yeah, how many one days ago was that?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   >> Listen, everybody shocked at how this has gone down.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   >> Not me.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   >> Really, just very -- well, you're so -- they're going
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   throughout these such issues.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But -- >> Exactly.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   >> Yang doesn't want to sell it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> That's why he's -- >> And he's -- yeah, exactly.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   However, what probably they're trying to do right now and who
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   knows if the successful is what Google did with AOL, which is
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Google bought 5% of AOL for a billion dollars and got all the
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   rights to the advertising space.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So if you can't own it on the advertising, which is what this
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   has always been about, is the advertising dollars.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And the amount of leverage Google has over AOL right now is
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   tremendous.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Like, they can ask AOL at any point in time to give them the
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   billion dollars back or, like, force them to go public and have a
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   liquid stock for AOL, i.e.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   spinning out.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And so AOL can't really do anything without Google's
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   blessing, I mean, unless they want to just give them all their
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   money back, which would be pretty hard to do.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So that's probably what Microsoft's going to try to do with
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yahoo, and it's probably not going to succeed.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   >> Is this something like the Facebook Microsoft deal?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   >> Or they put in a couple hundred million just, you know.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> Yeah, it's basically you invest, you get a piece of it, so
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   you've got an interest in it, and then you take all the ad
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   inventory.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   The meta issue here is that advertising is moving over to
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   online faster than anybody thought.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   That's why you say CBS by CNET this week.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Because CNET is, like, the number five player in terms of
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   advertising after Yahoo, AOL, Google, and Microsoft online,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   even though it's only a couple hundred million dollars.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   But it gives you this massive jumpsaur, and everybody's just
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   like, we have to get these advertising, digital advertising
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   dollars into our systems now.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   >> So that's interesting.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Let's fold in CBS CNET into this.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So they bought them not for the audience share or anything else.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   It's all about online advertising.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   >> The audience and the properties are great, but the CBS knows
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   that outdoor advertising, radio, and television are going to be
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   flat to downward business as they already are.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And so where's the growth going to come from?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Nobody wants to be in a declining business.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   You can ask AOL about that with their dial-up subscriber business.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So everybody's desperate to have a growth component of their
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   business so that their stock price goes up and so that they can,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   you know, make money off of these, you know, the senior management
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   can make money off of the stock options.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   They're granted at a certain price, right?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   So CBS has to transform that offline revenue into online
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   revenue, and this is just an huge way to do it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And CNET has so many properties that are undervalued and not
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   really paid attention to it.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   >> So it was a good deal.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   It was a good thing for them to buy, even at $1.8 billion.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> Brilliant move.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   >> That's a 44% premium.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   That's pretty high.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   >> That's actually the stock was underpriced, but let's back
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   up a minute.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Besides the fact that, of course, Jason thought this other deal
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   was going to go through too, but let me ask the big question.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   >> All right, John, I'm going to give you props.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I gave it to you a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   John was the only guy I've ever heard of who said this deal
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   would never happen.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   The Microsoft Yahoo deal.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   >> Let's ask this question.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   What is Microsoft trying to prove by becoming a media company?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   There have never been a media company before.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   They've tried it over and over again for some stupid reasons,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   like becoming a hardware company.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   When you talk about everything moving over to the Internet in
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   terms of advertising, yeah, you're talking about media
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   companies worried, sick that they're going to lose their
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   advertising edge in hard media, like TV, newspapers,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   magazines, things like that.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Microsoft's a software company for God's sake.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   >> John, what more leverage control online standards?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That would be one reason.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You think CNET would give them leverage for online standards?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   >> Microsoft should have about seen it.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   >> I think it has a lot to do with what they see Apple doing.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I mean, Apple's clearly going that direction and Microsoft's,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   they've had to keep trying.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   They don't really have much choice here.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   >> It's all about Google.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   >> Yeah, it's all about that direction.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   What ads do they run on what sites they have a search engine?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   >> That's a good point.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   They're not doing it with ads, but they're certainly
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   involved in the media site.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   >> That's mentioned live.com, hotmail, various and
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   sundry other properties.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> Interesting article in the New York Times to actually,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   they, by the way, the New York Times are at least Brian Stettler
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Stelter writing the New York Times agrees it's all about the
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   online ads of CBS's deal for CNET.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Interesting article saying that Mike, this is by Stoster,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   the San Jose state business professor, who I think writes
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   pretty good analyses of these things.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   It says that Microsoft's really faced with this issue of not,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   you know, not being able to turn the corner just as IBM was
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   unable to turn the corner when times change, it can't survive
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   paradigm shift and that Microsoft's just history and that nothing
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   they can do at this point is going to make a difference.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   >> Oh, my God.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Aren't the numbers at Microsoft going up, aren't they making more
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and more money? >> They're stock, you've been complaining
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   about they're stock like crazy.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   >> That's because everybody talks like you guys are talking,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   which is if downplay everything Microsoft does because they're
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   not somehow involved in selling advertisement when it's a
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   software company for God's sake.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   >> Yeah, that's awesome. >> Software really grants everything.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   >> It's not like Wall Street has a clue half the time anyway.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I mean, when, I mean, the stock price doesn't indicate the
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   real value you're saying.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   >> Yeah, no, I mean, I've--
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> Well, the stock price usually reflects the growth rate.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And so the growth rate seems to be, you know, I actually, I think
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   it is undervalued.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I think Microsoft stock's always been kind of undervalued for the
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   last couple of years.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   >> But I don't think Microsoft's making a lot of money because
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   of its internet plays.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's still making a lot of money based on its software, but it
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   continues to try to push and push and push.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I mean, even since Windows 5 with the Microsoft--
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   >> That's the question I'm asking is why do they persist?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   >> Right, right.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I think it's-- >> Because they think the average--
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   they think that the concept of selling software is going to
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   change to advertising based software.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And they want to have another growth business.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   They think that, you know, the software business they have has
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   reached, you know, monopolistic portions and it's not going
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   to grow that great, it's incremental.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And this other business online that's adjacent to them is
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   growing phenomenally well.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So they don't want to have all the software they create and all
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   the services they create be advertised and supported by other
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   companies like Google and Yahoo.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   >> Doug Cade, you have anything to say on this?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   You've been silent.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   >> I know, I've been completely silent, but I agree with Jason.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I think, you know, this is a company that is pretty much
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   maxed out.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   They can't grow.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I think if they take a long-term view--
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   >> They first joined that in 1990, by the way.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   >> Yeah, but it's still true, John.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   >> It's like-- I think that their legacy business has at least
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   capped out and if they look long-term, they need a new future.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And they're looking at many things.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   They're looking at ads, they're looking at media, and they always
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   have.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   They've always tried.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   >> And they're looking at cloud computing with mesh.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   That's right.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> Video games was a big push for them five years ago.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   >> That's right.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And they succeeded in that one, okay.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But they're big enough that they have to try all these things.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> Well--
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   >> And they have so much money that they can afford to throw
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   money, ridiculous amounts of money in so many different
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   areas.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   >> Right, they can't try all these things.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   >> Yeah, at this point, it's almost like record company
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   economics.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Let's start a thousand projects in, you know, a thousand different
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   areas.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And if one hits, you know, hey, we've got another major.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   >> I think if you go back 10, if you go back 10 years ago, I
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   don't think any of this would have said that a big challenger to
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Microsoft would be somebody who came out of the search engine
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   business.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   >> Google, yeah.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   >> Yeah, so they, they've got to keep their eye on everything.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And I don't think they can afford to leave any niches untouched.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   >> This is--
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   >> You know, do I, you should go work for them because they have
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   the same paranoid attitude that has led to some of these crazy
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   decisions.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> Randall Strauss writing in the New York Times gives some numbers
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   which do tell you something.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   For instance, in the 2006 fiscal year, online services, $74 million
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   loss, the year before a profit of $402 million, the numbers have
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   gotten worse and worse.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   In 2007, the online businesses lost $732 million.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   In the nine months subsequent through March 31st of this year,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   $745 million.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   They're hemorrhaging online.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Google, of course, the exact opposite.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   You know, he says it started in 1993.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   >> With MSN is when it started, these guys have been taking the
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   wrong road on everything.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   >> It made money though.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It made money until a couple of years ago was making money.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   >> Well, if they did all this money that they're losing, if they
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   did be distributing it to their shareholders instead of throwing
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   it away left and right on one crazy idea or another or this
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   $44 billion, for example, and give it to the shareholders, that
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   would push the price of the stock up.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   >> Pay them shareholders their money.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   >> Yeah, but that's actually implying that Wall Street is
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   that logical about how they price stocks.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   >> They don't like it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They don't like it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   The Microsoft doesn't play a David Enne.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   >> People also want a growth company.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   They want to see the price of the shares go up.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And so what John's advocating is saying, okay, pay dividends
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and be a dividend bearing stock.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And that's not the business that people who own that stock
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   want them to be in.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   They want them to be in the growth business.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And by John's logic, they would never have done the Xbox.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And so in order to get like an Xbox, you may need to have 10 zoons.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And that's just the nature of the business.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And when you're that big, it's hard to do things right.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   >> No, but when you're that big, that's the time to calm down.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Give up on these crazy ideas that you can do other things where
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   you have no core competency whatsoever and give the shareholders
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   their money.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   >> Right.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Well, in related news, Steve Jobs is going to pull back the iPhone
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   because he should have given a dividend.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   This is why you don't run a company, John.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   That's why you're a journalist.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It's because you have an illogical view of this.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   >> Jason, you're saying put the money in R&D and new products
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   not into, don't pay back the stockholders.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   >> You pay back the stockholders by increasing the shareholder value.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I mean, yes, dividends are great, but it's not why people are buying technology
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   companies.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   They want to do bold things.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   >> They want growth.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   >> And it's really, the online advertising space on the Internet
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   is in the second or third inning, Max.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It's just starting and the impact is going to be global.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And so, you know, just like Windows was a global story and Office was a global story
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   and their server business was a global story.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   This is a global story.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It's talking about, you know, tens of billions of dollars a year already.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It's going to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It could be a business that's bigger than Microsoft's existing business,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   so they have no choice but to go for it or split up the company and go for it
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   three different ways.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   >> Well, also, I don't know.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So that's actually a better idea than anything else you've come up with.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   >> I don't know of that many technology companies that pay a dividend anyway.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Off the top of my head, I think does IBM even pay a dividend?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   >> You can go to the tech business.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   >> No, it's not a dividend-garing business.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   >> When you have a bunch of cheerleaders like Jason in the background, you know,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   pushing that concept that you should never pay a dividend and just keep, you know,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   reinvesting the money until you go completely broke, which is what happens to you.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   >> Yeah, guys.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   >> A lot of these companies.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   >> Guys, IBM's paying 40 and 50 cents per share dividends.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Matter of fact, they've been paying 30 cents.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   >> You're right there, an old school company.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   >> I'm not, you know, for all this stuff.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   >> I mean, I mean, you don't buy IBM for gross.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   >> You don't buy IBM for gross.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   >> Right.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   >> But it's also, but it also, IBM's more like Coca-Cola than this.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, you don't buy them for growth.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They're a blue chick.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   >> When you get that, you've got to change your strategy.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   You can't just start throwing money away in the same proportions you did when you were a small company.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   The $44 billion that Microsoft wanted to drop on Yahoo was basically all the money they had in the bank.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   >> That's why they're going to sell it for every buyer.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   >> Yes.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   >> I got a question for every buyer.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   >> Patrick Norton.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   >> How does this impact the average listener?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   >> Not at all.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   >> Of Twig.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   >> How about?
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   >> Is Microsoft going to go out of business?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Are they going to lose their core competencies as demonstrated with Vista?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Should they slowly fade away?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   >> They're going to slowly fade away.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   >> Lesson lets relevant over time as Google becomes more and more relevant.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   >> So we're all going to be doing cloud computing.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   >> Cloud computing, baby.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   >> Off on iPhones once they get that Bluetooth keyboard thing.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   >> Yeah, first note.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   >> Here's a question talking about money, spending money is a...
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   >> Oh, first note?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   John?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   >> Actually, it was just watching a 4 gigabyte download and it slowed considerably after about the first 300 megabytes.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   >> You're on Comcast and you're downloading stuff in the background while you're talking to me?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   >> I turned it off for half an hour.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   >> Good.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   >> That's how long ago that part of the conversation.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   >> So Leo, what were you just interrupt for a second?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   >> Yes.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   >> Frank, Comcast Care says that he'll talk to us and explain burst on the show right now if we wanted to get a hold of them.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   >> And I wonder how I get them on.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   >> Well, let me send a note to them in the background and get a strike.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   >> It's kind of what a Skype handle is and we'll add them in.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I'd love that.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   We were talking before the show and actually might have been during the show at this point.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I have no idea what the show, when the show began or what it is.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   But we were talking about this burst mode, which is what do you call it?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   What do they call it?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   >> Power boost.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   >> Power boost.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And I've got Comcast business here and I was kind of blown away when I did a speed test.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It was 22 megabits down and 3 megabits up.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And what are you getting in Houston?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   >> Well, I'm on the puny 6 megabit residential service and I get about 10 to 11 megabits when I do that speed test.net.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   >> So your assertion was it's only for a limited period of time.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   >> Right.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   As they've told me here, because I covered when Time Warner switched over to Comcast in Houston, it's on the first 10 megabits.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And there's also a power boost going up too on the up street.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   So don't get fooled by that.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   So while we're getting Frank, who is Comcast cares on Twitter, by the way, I stopped following him because it was just all these messages to people about,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   "Oh, we care. We care."
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Really, we care.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   >> Yeah, he's worse.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   >> Scoble.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   >> He's terrible.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It's awful.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   But if you need him, it's good to know he's there.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So you wrote a bit on your blog on the Houston Chronicle asking, "Quaring whether you think 1.8 billion is too much for CNET?"
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   >> Yeah, it just strikes me, you know, that's a 44% premium.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   The only thing that, you know, that Jason talks about the advertising, and that's a good point.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   But the other thing is, is they have a lot of domains that have not really lived up to their potential.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   >> That's what Patrick was saying, that there's some value there.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   >> And CBS.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   >> Television.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   >> Right.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   TV.com.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   CBS now owns TV.com.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   >> And in the 3.com.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   That's a lot of potential there.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   CNET was really squandering both of those.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   >> What is TV.com?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   >> I don't know if they were squandering, but they just never managed to get the kind of traction they wanted.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Because they got MP3.com from our favorite Linux developer, P.P.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   >> Right, Michael Rogers.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And that just never, that just, you know, they were trying to do something to make it as competitive with any other music service,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and it just never quite gelled.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   >> Do you think that, you know, it's like a television news, I mean, it's news about television and clips and so forth.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   It's really, it's almost like a TV guide.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   >> I'll be honest, that would make more sense to me.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I can't understand what CBS would want with a tech news site or tech reviews.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   To me, that's the last thing the network would ever want, but that makes sense that they want MP3.com and TV.com.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   >> But they've been acquiring a lot of other properties though.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Right, they picked up a lot of other properties.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   >> Metacritic, shout out.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   >> They have, Wall strip.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   >> And remember, in the early on, they had one point owned market watch.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   >> No, they got partners.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   They never actually owned them.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   >> It was, it was a CBS market watch.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   >> Yeah, it's called CBS market watch, but it was kind of a joint venture market watch has own share prices.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And when they finally did, tried to do a deal where CBS was going to buy market watch completely.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Dow Jones came in with a better offer and that took them over.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It wasn't like they ever really had that much.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   It wasn't like CBS sold them to Dow Jones.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   >> So is CBS interested only in the online advertising and these little kind of mainstream sites that have been underutilized?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Are they going to gut the tech side of it?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   >> Well, they also, CBS said that they were interested also in their global reach.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   CNET has got a strong foothold in China.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   >> Right.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   >> And they were very interested in that.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   >> Should Tom and Molly be worried, Patrick, you think?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   >> No, not at all.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   >> Because I mean, >> Not about that.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   >> Well, what should they worry about?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   >> Well, I mean, there's, I mean, one, they're a pretty successful story on the channel in a number of ways.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And two, CNET has a very good ad sales team.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And three, there's still millions of eyeballs shopping up and making buying decisions based on CNET recommendations.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   It gets interesting is if CNET or CBS comes in and says, you know, all these product reviews cost too much, you have to reduce costs.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   You know, there's a bunch of ways to reduce costs through, you know, eliminating a lot of the in-house development because CNET just developed a lot of software over the years rather than buying it from out of house.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   There's obviously, you know, duplicities and, you know, the accounting and finance department.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   >> I think duplications, there may be duplicities, but we know there's duplications.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   >> Right.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   >> They're counting, they're counting department.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   There may be duplicities.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   You never know.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   >> I assume that was a misstatement and not an accusation.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   >> I liked it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   >> I mean, but to get to the point though, is there's a bunch of ways to reduce costs and there's some really interesting core operations.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I just hope they don't start taking out some of the funding for the reviews program over there.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   >> Right.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   >> So, you know, we have a lot of friends in the tech side there.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And I just, you know, I watch what happens when mainstream media take over, you know, properties that some of the properties is tech.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   They just, they don't seem to care that much about the tech side of it.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   >> I don't know why they buy a company like that.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I mean, that's, they're still, they're breading butters to tech side.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   >> You said, though, it sounds like all this other stuff is what they're interested in.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   >> No, that stuff can't be, I mean, come on.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I mean, I've talked to people over there where I can affect the, uh, me, the offices right up the street so I'd wander by.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And there's, there were those things are, are you set for the tech republic, which is another tech site.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Those other things aren't, aren't, you know, adding much to the bottom line yet.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   >> How about their gaming sites? They have gaming, don't they?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   >> Game spot.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   >> Game spot.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   >> That's one of the three biggest gaming sites on live.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   >> They have a really large auto site on one of the biggest auto sites.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Do you remember what it is?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   >> See, it sounds like a pretty good deal when you put it all together.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I mean, 1.8 billion is like what Google paid for YouTube.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   >> No, I think, I think Jason had it right when he said there's a lot of underutilized stuff.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   >> I know the guy who did this deal, his name is Quincy Smith.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   He's also an investor in Mahalo.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And he previously worked at Allen and company and seen that's been on the market for a long time.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I was approached to be the, you know, senior management in a takeover bid by some private equity guys.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And I've looked at this asset a number of times.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And you have to have a theory when you buy one of these as to how you're going to double triple the revenue.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And when we looked at it for different things as a standalone company, unless you were going to invest a couple hundred million dollars, I couldn't come up with the theory.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   The theory that CBS has is they have television, radio and outdoor and radio, especially radio.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Especially radio are very good at driving traffic to online assets.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Radio is awesome because people aren't looking at something, they're typing, et cetera.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   They're in front of the computers listening to the radio.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And they can push a lot of traffic to these brands.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And that's what they're going to do.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And then the advertising people over at CNET are going to be doing group buys.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   So you have all the digital people who will be able to sell up to advertising and the online advertising and radio.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And billboard people are selling down into packages with digital assets.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   So when they talk to Nokia, they can put Nokia on TV, on a billboard, in radio and online.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   It's a very compelling package.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And CBS isn't so huge that they couldn't make that happen.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   CBS is sort of a tweener.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   It's not quite as big as Time Warner, but it's not tiny.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   It's got 14 billion in revenue.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And this is adding 400 million.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   So this is an acquisition.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   They can actually do well.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And a lot of these small com they own.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   They could really blow this stuff out.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And they could do television shows based on GameSpot or radio shows based on GameSpot.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   This could be a beautiful, this could be what the Time Warner AOL merger was supposed to be.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   I think some of that's okay.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   But come on, the radio shows and TV shows, I mean, look, they got the G4 network to compete against.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I guess maybe they can take people off.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Nobody wants to watch technology.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I mean, it's just, you know, it's not in the millions.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   It's in the hundreds of thousands.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   It's because most of the people will go ahead.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Imagine the imagine the imagine the person from Cnet.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Imagine Molly being on the early show, which gets through the early show.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   And then you're like, I'm not going to go ahead and see what happens.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And your television business is drying up, which it is.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And you want to spend a billion dollars to bootstrap yourself into more online than you've been doing.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Who else are you going to buy?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   What else are you going to do?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I know what else you could do.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   What?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Improve the crappy product that you already have.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So the newspapers do.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   I want to see Molly.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   They cheapen the product.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   They cheapen the product and they start losing readers.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And then they wonder why it's unbelievable to me.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   But you know, so the TV business is not doing well.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And they want to bootstrap it.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.480]   They want to give themselves a quick way to improve the online business since they know that's
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.760]   their future.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   What are they going to do?
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.240]   They've got to do with an acquisition.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.840]   Who else could they buy?
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.240]   Who else is out there?
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   I think so.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.440]   There's no person after seeing them.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.320]   After that, it drops down 400 million in revenue to like 50 or 100 million.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.800]   That's like we have a great idea here.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   This was a good deal.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   It was the right deal to make.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.400]   And it was probably close to the right price.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   I think Jason's right.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.760]   I think the 45, whatever his percent premium is not so bad for this.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.760]   It was undervalued.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.560]   It's been undervalued for a long time.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.360]   It's been on the market for two years.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.960]   I mean, it's Janet Partners has been pushing there when a minority holder, right?
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.560]   And they've been pushing for a while to shape up seen it.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.800]   They've been saying, well, it's seen that's not well run.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.960]   The problem with it is they're doing too many different things.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.280]   No management team can be running a food site, a tax site, entertainment site at this site
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.120]   gives it's too much for one one management.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.360]   Can can Leslie Moonves be the guy to whip it into shape?
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:12.120]   If you put a lot of managers on this, like a lot of mid level managers on each project
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   and give them each budget.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.080]   Yeah, because that's a bigger scale company.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.720]   Aging thousands of employees.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   All right.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.080]   Let's add Frank Elias and he is Comcast Cares.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.920]   I don't know what the I'm for some reason I'm getting a lot of Tokyo Metro sounds in
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   here.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.920]   Hello, Frank.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   Are you there?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   How is everybody today?
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.960]   It's Comcast Cares, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   He speaks.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   Hello, Frank.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   Thank you.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.880]   So welcome to Twitch.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.080]   You are we've we found out about your last one.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.280]   There's about 140 characters.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.040]   Yeah, you can you can actually use longer sentences now, Frank.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.680]   Frank is Comcast Cares on Twitter.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.200]   And that's how we became aware of him last week.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.400]   We talked about it on a Twitter.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.800]   And now we wanted you to come in here for one simple thing to explain what this power.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.040]   What does it power boost?
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   What does it do?
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.240]   How do it work?
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:08.360]   Well, first of all, you have power boost, then you have blast power boost does up your
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:14.280]   speeds for the first 10 megabytes or so as you were as was pointed out earlier, that's
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:19.480]   available for people that have usually the eight megabyte point megabyte plan as well
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.840]   as the six megabyte plan.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   Okay.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.080]   But then blast, which is what we set John up with is 16 megabytes.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.720]   16 to is his speed, then he blasts his on or power boost on top of that.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.080]   That's why like for myself, I was actually rich during 30 a few months ago.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.680]   Now Frank, this power boost increase your 16 megabit per second only basically it only
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.080]   gives you additional bandwidth on your cap.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.400]   If the server at the other end is capable of sustaining it, right?
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   That is correct.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.960]   The thing not only is the server on the other end is capable of it, but also what is going
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.360]   on within the nodes that you're in.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.800]   Is it allowing if there's available bandwidth at that time for you to take advantage of?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.760]   So that's why it's very effective.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.440]   Hey Frank, are you in the New York subway walking past a buster?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.360]   No, it's music.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.640]   Get closer to your mic.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.520]   That music that you're so lovely hearing is the swing.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.480]   I have a two month old baby who is swinging behind me.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.000]   Oh, I love that.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.760]   I have one of those in my office actually.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.320]   You know, they make them adult size now.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   Two month old babies.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   So let's get back to this.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.880]   Now Frank, so I got the 16.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.960]   So it bursts up to high numbers just for it, but it falls back to 16.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.080]   If I can get 16, is that what you're saying?
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.240]   It will fall back on sustained downloads.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.280]   If nobody else is using your node and the server at the other end can support more than
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   16 megabits.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.240]   You're going to be taking care of it.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.120]   So it's not going to increase your split on the local node versus the other clients
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.240]   on the node unless it exceeds your existing bandwidth cap.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Right.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   And everything's available.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   That's exactly it.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   Okay.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.640]   So the likelihood of any of us ever seeing power burst, you know, between the hours of
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.000]   like six a.m. and probably three a.m. or pretty slight.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.440]   No, to be honest with you, I almost always seen pretty good speeds most of the time.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.680]   The only times that especially those of you like John in the Bay Area where we've done
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.040]   a lot of upgrades in doing those upgrades a lot of splitting out some nodes that were
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.600]   overloaded.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.760]   And so you will see in those areas much better sustained.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.360]   What song is your swing playing?
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.720]   I am trying to figure that out.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   I don't know.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   It's very beautiful.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   I know.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.600]   I only I tried to use a microphone instead of the one on the computer.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.920]   So I'm like, that's fine.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.960]   My mind plays a my planes metallic as enter sandman and I really find that very rest.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.160]   He was also attracted to shiny objects.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.560]   It sounds like Zamfir the pan flute actually.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.080]   Frank, I have a question for you.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.240]   What's your official title there at Comcast?
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.280]   What do you what are you really doing your day job?
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   What is my job?
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.840]   I really know my job is changing quite a bit.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   Thanks to.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.880]   Did you was this was this your idea to go on Twitter and to say let's do some customer
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   service on Twitter?
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:18.120]   No, actually what happened I started with Comcast in September and at the time I started
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:24.560]   to get information off the internet and then within a few days doing that start reaching
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.360]   out and calling people and we started seeing success with that.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.480]   So my job is kind of involved into doing online social media work.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.480]   That's interesting.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:42.160]   And then about two months ago, someone who's on Twitter came up with W Scott W three.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.920]   He's actually an ADP for Comcast in New Mexico.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   He sent me an email and said, you know, you really need to check out Twitter.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.320]   And so I started watching Twitter.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.160]   My head was spinning.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.520]   So we were watching it quite a bit.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.640]   And then about a month or a little over a month ago, Michael Arrington, we reached out
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   to him.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.840]   We reached out to others on there too.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.600]   But because of the publicity with that, we I decided the next day to start actually
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.720]   writing on that's going to her too.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.320]   So it's been actually great.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.880]   And how has Comcast reacted to what's going on there?
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.760]   The reaction has been extremely positive.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.880]   In fact, you know, just that brought on seven people to join a group that I'm putting together
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.600]   for social media and to get more involved.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   It's actually been very much embraced.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.440]   You know, but at the same time, I have to kind of show people what Twitter really is.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.040]   Because a lot of people don't understand it.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.840]   Hey, Frank, could you help me out because I'm only 19 people ahead of Kevin Rose right
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.680]   now on Twitter.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.320]   If you could just send some of your followers my way, just say, you know, Leo, the poor
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.280]   nice guy, follow him, unfollow Kevin Rose.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   I'd appreciate it.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.000]   Leo, you've already passed up Barack Obama.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.680]   I'm trying to catch up.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.640]   No, but I don't want Kevin Rose to beat me.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.160]   This is the part where we all have our own.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.680]   Okay, everybody give out their Twitter and then we're going to end it.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.640]   Frank has Comcast cares on Twitter.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.800]   Patrick, you are Patrick Norton.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Right?
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   John C. Devorek is the real Devorek.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.200]   Dwight, are you D. Silverman?
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   What is that?
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   I'm D. Silverman.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   D. Silverman.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Yeah, that's D. Silverman.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   You're talking to him.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   V. D. Silverman.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   Boy, it's great.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.760]   I've been following for a long time on Twitter.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.560]   Jason is Jason Calicans.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.960]   And Doug Kay, I think you're not on Twitter.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.960]   Oh, I'm on Twitter.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.880]   Just Doug Kay with a knee on the end.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.560]   Oh, I can't believe I'm not following you.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.800]   I'm the best kept people on Twitter.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:45.400]   Including a -- did a column a couple of weeks ago on a woman who was crying out for help
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.360]   out of Houston for Comcast and he wound up taking care of her.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.640]   It was really interesting.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:57.080]   We have comments under our stories on the website and the comments from people who basically
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.960]   said, "Well, Comcast doesn't help me."
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.640]   And then Frank jumped into our comments and started helping folks in our comments.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.120]   So he goes where he's needed.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.720]   Frank, do you think this is going to be a trend among other corporations?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.840]   I mean, I think that not just Twitter, but using these social networks for customer service.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   I actually do.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.520]   I think if you look at the Dell model from a few years back, and everybody remembers Dell
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.640]   help, and it really started perfecting the reaching out on the internet.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.440]   I think most companies are actually eventually find their way there.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.600]   But I think most companies are like -- the executives are showing.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.160]   You need to show them what benefits are.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.640]   And I think people have someone who works for them that actually just does it.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.360]   And we'll see the similar phrase that we've seen.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.040]   And the executives will say, "Well, why aren't we doing more of this?"
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.040]   So I think it's going to be a ball.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   I think the publicity we've seen, I think it's going to force some evolution.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.160]   Frank, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.280]   I hear your baby waking up.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.760]   So I'm going to let you go.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.280]   Well, thank you, everybody.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   Great to talk to you.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   See you, Frank.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   Frank Elias and who is Comcast Cares.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.880]   So does anybody find it ironic that he had the worst connection of all of us?
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.360]   It wasn't his bandwidth.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   It was fantastic.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.640]   It was purely the microphone because he had to reach over and push that swing.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.240]   I've known when the batteries die on those swings, it's a real pain.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   I hate that.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.480]   Go Colleen, wind me up!
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   Okay.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.920]   So, there you go.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.720]   Does that answer your question, John, about what --
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.120]   So when you have the 16-2 service, that means it bursts up to some high speed for sure.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.480]   Well, then drops back to 16.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.240]   But if you think about it, that's really kind of mostly what you want because when you're
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.720]   loading a web page or something, the first 10 megabits are the most important.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.560]   That's true, but at 16, I mean, I don't think I really need any more of a burst, you know.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.200]   But the other thing is I'm not getting 16.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.680]   I mean, I'm getting 16 on the test, but there's nobody's delivering 16.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   No, no, outside site.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.440]   No, they don't deliver 16.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   So why would they?
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.280]   Well, the content delivery networks do.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.680]   If you go to Akamai, Lyme, might anybody --
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.160]   Very rarely, very rarely do they get that high.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.560]   I'll tell you, when you download our podcast -- I noticed because we're on several different
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.640]   -- we're on CashFly, we're on AOL, and then we're on just kind of a regular Internet
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.600]   service provider DSL Extreme for the radio show.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.040]   And I'll tell you, I could see the difference.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.720]   AOL and CashFly, those are both CDNs.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   It comes in fast.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.720]   Yeah, we've also --
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.960]   We've benchmarked Fire out of a limelight, and Amazon S3.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.120]   Both of them are capable of extremely high and sustain levels.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.280]   IT conversations is on Limelight and S3.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.960]   We've used both right now, all the contents on Limelight, but we've used S3 in the past
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.520]   for some of our other stuff.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.560]   Did you do that on a consumer account?
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.600]   Did you benchmark those on a consumer account or a corporate account?
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:50.520]   We had to do it on multiple accounts in order just to get enough bandwidth to soak it up.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520]   Right.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.480]   I mean, because I'm on Comcast in the Bay Area, too, Patrick.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.600]   And I've got one of these power boost accounts, and I have the same things you get, which
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.360]   is it's great for a few seconds, and then it slows down.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.640]   Well, one of the things I found is you can find -- if you can find college students with
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.080]   Internet2 connections, we had one guy who would help us out because we were having some
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:15.400]   issues with Limelight, and he could basically max out anything because they had the most
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   insane routing.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.000]   They had some of the shortest routing I've ever seen.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   That's the thing.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.480]   It's so complicated because it's who's peering with whom.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.600]   It's how their routing goes.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.600]   How many hops?
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.040]   There's so many variables, you can never really be sure where the issue is.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.160]   Oh, you can.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.800]   You can be really, really sure if you take the time to trace it down.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   Do a big trace route.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.840]   You start with a trace route, then you do individual files, and it's a pain in the ass,
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.080]   but you can figure out a lot about where it slows down.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.400]   It wasn't that long ago that your average server only had a 10-megabit connection to
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.560]   its internal network.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.720]   And so there's no way that it's going to service even a single person any faster than
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.120]   10-megabits.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.800]   Now they've got 100-megabit and gigabit connections, but if you think about how fast
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.280]   can you literally get the stuff out of a box, you're limited by some of those physical
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280]   internet connections.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.480]   It's just a matter of time before the hard drive speeds are going to start limiting you.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.040]   Well, now everything's being cached.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:13.080]   So you're not subject to the disks, but you do have an issue of once you start to download
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.600]   a file, all of that file comes from a single server.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.440]   You can't typically switch servers in the middle of a download.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.840]   So how fast can you get it out of the box?
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.840]   That's an issue.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   You can always get overrun.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.600]   And we're dealing with that with streaming video.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.360]   That's a very demanding thing as well.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.920]   You'll find in a lot of cases also is that when they're sniffing the packets, they're
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:38.200]   taking a pretty close look at what type of file it is and what the source is.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.440]   And I've actually seen pretty heavy.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.400]   It's enough evidence where it's going from circumstantial onto pretty likely that a
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.640]   lot of consumer ISPs are throttling video traffic and throttling traffic from certain
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.640]   CDNs.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.040]   Oh, that's not just BitTorrent, but from certain CDNs as well.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:04.560]   Well, it's in some cases one of the justifications for it is imagine if you have a huge number
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.720]   of teenagers in your particular local ISP.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.640]   You just have it, it turns out like...
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   I have mixed feelings.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   I didn't want to put Frank on the spot.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.320]   It's not his job to defend Comcast's peer-to-peer policy.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.120]   Yes, it is.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.520]   Okay, let's get him back on.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.000]   Let's get him back on because we...
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.800]   We'll get him back on some other time.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.280]   Yeah, well, I'll be now.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.200]   But I'm not even talking about peer-to-peer.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.080]   I'm talking about straight HTTP downloads.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   And it's actually...
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.080]   I mean, it's kind of amazing.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.760]   You start looking at the way packets are handled.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.600]   And there's some really interesting stuff that you can't really...
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.360]   When you basically start tracking the speed or tracking the ping times between servers,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.680]   and you start looking at people who can download from site A at 5 megabits for second-end site
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.680]   B at 300K.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:59.080]   I see you use this really great piece of software out of Israel called download accelerator,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.280]   which was number one on download.com, which is a CNET property, for a long time.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.200]   And what it would do is it would open multiple FTP connections to servers, download four
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.440]   streams at once, and then put it together.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   That's cool.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.040]   And then it got so popular people started on blocking it.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.760]   Yeah, because you're basically ending around and arounding their bandwidth limiting techniques
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.560]   because you're opening multiple connections to them.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   They handle the server.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:30.160]   Yeah, but I could download Doom 2's trial, you know, an aliphos.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   I use it too.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.320]   I remember that it was actually other software that was really bad, which what it used to
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.320]   do is...
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   32.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:44.840]   Pre-caching it with every time you load a web page, you would open up the first 20 links
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.400]   or something in the background.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.040]   Firefox does that now.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   Firefox too.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.960]   That's the problem with Firefox too, is pre-caching all the pages on the page.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   Really bad.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.840]   That seems to me to be a very bad internet policy, you know, citizenship, I don't think.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.920]   You know, it was a good idea long ago, but now with all these pages loading up with all
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.680]   kinds of ads and going through double click and...
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.160]   Well, it doesn't load JavaScript.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   It doesn't load JavaScript.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   It doesn't...
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.320]   We have fast enough connections.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.720]   It makes sense if you're on a 300-baud connection.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.120]   It doesn't make sense on a broadband connection.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:22.080]   By the way, a German company, the Max Planck Institute, I'm glad that Max Planck, one of
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.360]   the great physicists, quantum mechanics, there is now a Max Planck Institute for Software
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.160]   Systems.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.480]   And what great important deep subject are they studying?
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:39.720]   Comcast and Cox are slowing bit torrent traffic all through the clock, all times a day.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.520]   They use more than 8,000 nodes worldwide to test biz-torrent blocking.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.080]   Found the Comcast was interrupting at least 30% of bit torrent upload attempts around the
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.080]   clock, contrary to what Comcast has said, which is that we're only doing it during peak
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   hours.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.160]   At noon, Comcast was interfering with more than 80% of bit torrent traffic, 60% at other
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   times.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.280]   Because noon's actually one of the noon Eastern standards, one of the heaviest times.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.000]   Yeah, everybody does it at work.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.280]   Cox is interfering with 100 Cox, which is another cable company, smaller cable company,
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:15.240]   interfering with 100% of bit torrent traffic, 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 5 a.m., so all around the
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.840]   clock.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.280]   So is this, I mean, it's kind of funny that this same ISPs that don't want to be held
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.960]   accountable for being able to control what's on their network, which would make them a
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.760]   publisher, which would make them liable for, which would open to all sorts of interesting
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.960]   lawsuits, are finding themselves, finding it the necessity.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.520]   Either out of fear of the RA and the MPAA, or because they just don't want their network
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   saturated or throttling.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.560]   I'm a little sympathetic as a user of a broad, I have four different broadband, five different
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.400]   broadband connections in here.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:51.480]   If some kid down the street, all of a sudden decides to download the entire Arnold Schwarzenegger
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.400]   or, I don't want to have to suddenly, you know, shut down, to it live because I can't
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.120]   get the bandwidth for it.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   But I mean, the flip side is, you know, don't you want to be able, if you're paying this
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.840]   monthly fee, don't you think they should be honest about what you're actually getting
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.560]   for this monthly fee?
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:13.760]   Well, the ISP business has always been based on aggregation of traffic.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.760]   Back when it was modem pools.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.640]   I mean, no one has ever been able to supply all of the maximum bit rates of all of its
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.640]   customers.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.960]   So that's just the name of the beast, I think.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   Right.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.640]   But I think a lot of places outside the US that have bandwidth caps here in Australia,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.000]   people have bandwidth caps that are pretty onerous.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.560]   And what they really should do in the US is they should offer one rate, which is for
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.760]   with a bandwidth cap.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.400]   That's cheap, 10 bucks, 15 bucks, and they should offer an unlimited, which is 75 bucks
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   or something.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.600]   I know that sounds crazy.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.760]   People don't like that, but these providers do have to pay for this bandwidth.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.440]   They do have to pay for this infrastructure.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.160]   Well, so they're peering, Jason, they're all peering.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.880]   I mean, the major ISPs are all peering and they're not paying for the bandwidth, which
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880]   is what they're paying.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.160]   They're protecting me as a customer by saying no one customer could be a pig.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.160]   No, Joe.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.520]   Leo, they're not protecting you as a customer.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.120]   They're shutting off other customers' ability to do what they want to do with their neck.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.240]   Yeah, which is in some cases being piggy.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.600]   Throttling is one thing.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   You're right.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   They're blank.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   You're right.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   They're completely different.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.600]   You're right.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.600]   That's true.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.600]   That's true.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600]   That's true.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   That's true.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   That's true.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   That's true.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   That's true.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.600]   I have no problem with throttling.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.040]   You can tease like, well, they actually get the bandwidth you think you're paying for.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.640]   You have to go for a business account.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   Right.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   Okay.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   And that's how much.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.720]   We've been downloading the entire Arnold Schwarzenegger-Ervra for the last four days.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.600]   We'll find out what Comcast really cares.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.720]   I have no problem with prioritizing and stuff.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.920]   I just don't want to see them shutting down.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.400]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.160]   What they're doing by turning off bit towards, regardless of how much you've downloaded,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.640]   I mean, they're cutting the seeds.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   That's a whole nother thing.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   And I think you're right, Patrick.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.480]   That is entering into the editorial realm, saying, well, bit towards bad.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.800]   And the next thing you know, suddenly you're getting sued in various states for allowing,
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.360]   you know, obscenities to cross your network.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   You're a suit.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.160]   You're not seriously built through this stuff.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   No, you're right.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.360]   The ISPs are starting to look at doing tiered pricing in the United States.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.200]   Prime Warner is trialing it over in Beaumont down the freeway here.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.160]   And but primarily with new customers.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.280]   I think it's probably going to come even Comcast has said they're looking at that.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.200]   Well, it's tiered in a way.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.120]   I mean, you know, you pay for power boost, right?
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.640]   I mean, it's not something you get automatic.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.080]   No, you do get automatic.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   You do.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   Our boost is free.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.080]   Power boost is a bonus.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.080]   It's a gimme.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.280]   But as a business class user, I had a choice between two tiers and I opted for the higher
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   tier.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.760]   And so I'm tiered.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.160]   Maybe and maybe maybe home users aren't yet tiered, but I think that's actually there.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.360]   There are tears.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.560]   We're talking about bandwidth cap tiers, tiers based on the amount of.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.760]   Well, that's what we've been talking about.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.480]   This 250 gigabyte per month cap.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.400]   Yeah, we talked about that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.600]   I had to pay extra for power boost.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   What did I do wrong?
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.840]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   So you don't always have to.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.400]   Are you confusing power burst with power boost with birth?
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.520]   Because power boost is something that basically ups the bandwidth for the first, you know,
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520]   10 megabits of a download.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   Where it's from?
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520]   It goes all the way.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.320]   First is a product that's basically a tiered level of service.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.680]   No, I got the first thing.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   I got it about a year ago.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.240]   I called them up and they said, for an extra $10 a month, we'll double your download and
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   upload speeds.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.800]   I said, how long will it take?
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   When do I have to make it?
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   When do I get that?
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.720]   He said, well, no, we'll do it in about the next two minutes.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.160]   And sure enough, two minutes later, my download speed was up.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.520]   That's not power boost.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.720]   Oh, that's not okay.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.840]   Yeah, that's basically magic.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.280]   Power boost is applies across all the tiers of services.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.920]   What you did was basically is you bought the new cool guy.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   I'll tell you one thing.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.360]   We're just glad we are not customers of the fabulous Paul Allen Charter High Speed Internet
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   Service.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.800]   Not that we have any issues with Paul Allen.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.120]   Not that we care one bit.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.560]   By the way, Patrick, happy 10th anniversary of ZDT.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.200]   Oh, you weren't at the beginning there at the beginning.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   So it's not.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   Actually, I was there at the beginning.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   I started at March.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   I started for the launch.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   May 11th.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.200]   You just weren't on the screensavers yet.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   May 11th, 2000.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.200]   I'm sorry, 1998.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   Because I moved to San Francisco March.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   I feel right.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   I feel right, you're right, you're right.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.120]   You came with Jim Latterback and you were kind of more in the lab at first.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120]   Yes.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   I was bringing products and actually helping solve some of the production issues with
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   computers on your set.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.240]   I was one of the little people.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   I didn't notice you then.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   I had yours.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   Yes.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.240]   I didn't know who you were.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.240]   You kept confusing me with some intern named Roger.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.040]   We look alike, you see.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   Oh, no.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   Look at that.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   And John C. de Vorek did.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   Were you a Silicon spender?
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.040]   Did that start at the beginning of a technical?
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   Start up show.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.920]   So May 11th, 1998, we didn't mention it last week.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:52.120]   I was remiss, but it's the 10th anniversary of the founding of ZD TV was one week ago.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.280]   Okay.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   Not that it means anything.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   I just thought I'd mention it.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.480]   It's really in many ways.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.160]   What quit is is as a successor to that, what you're doing in revision three and with
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.480]   Tekzilla Patrick is a successor to that.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.840]   I'd say it had a pretty dramatic impact on my life and your life.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.440]   John's life, not so much.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.400]   He was already famous.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   What did you think of the dash unit, Leo?
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.960]   Oh, I'm going to get to that in a second.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.480]   I just want to talk about this charter thing and let's talk about dash because I think
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.920]   they're doing something very interesting and they are not an advertiser, by the way.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.440]   No, but we'd welcome their money.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:30.520]   Charter, Charter, which is doing deep packet inspection is using it for a unique purpose.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   And I love the spin on the charter website.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.920]   They have an FAQ that this is the answer to the question.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.600]   And I know I get this question a lot.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:43.640]   What enhancements are coming to Charter's high speed internet service?
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.320]   While continuing to deliver the same fast and reliable internet service you've already
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:53.040]   received, innovative new technology in the field of online advertising enables Charter
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.440]   to provide you with an enhanced online experience that is more customized to your interests
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.840]   and activities.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:05.240]   As a result of this service, the advertising you typically see online will better reflect
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.080]   the interests you express through your web surfing activity.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:13.200]   Translation, Mr. Norton, would you like to translate that marketing speaker?
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.680]   You seem very good at that.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.920]   For all eight of you out there in Charterland that use our browser and our interface every
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.840]   time you log in much like the AOL of your, basically they're just tracking and targeting
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.840]   ads.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.800]   It sounds like they're going to insert ads into sites.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.120]   Yeah, that was why I was wondering.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.600]   I want to know if they're basically talking about the classic AOL style filter for the
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.040]   internet's, you can opt out of this.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.720]   But it sounds like they're going to, yeah, you can opt out of it, but it sounds like
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.840]   they have this at AOL through the to code acquisition.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.800]   What they do is, and some other people are doing this, you want the ISPs, there's third
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.040]   parties that take the ISP data, then they sell it to other advertisers.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:01.640]   And then those advertisers say, okay, if this person has been on these 100 technology
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.560]   sites before, then give them technology ads.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.520]   The thing I think about it is I think it's anti-competitive.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.640]   I think there's a lawsuit waiting to happen, which is it's interfering with the ability
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.160]   of those sites to sell advertising.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.240]   So if I was running WebLogs Inc and somebody was going to people saying, I can sell you
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.040]   Engagit readers, I could sue them.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.080]   I think that's what's going to happen.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.280]   Yeah, that's absolutely where this is headed.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.240]   And the thing that I think the giveaway is, and people out there should know that we were
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.840]   talking about this before the show began, but the fact of the matter is there was some
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.680]   discussion, maybe you can find it in this document where they said you will not get
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   more ads.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.480]   No, you'll just get the same.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.880]   The number of ads, but they'll be more targeted.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.600]   Yes, they'll be bumping somebody off.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.680]   If you've got a page coming in with five ads and you're not going to get more ads, how
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.840]   does that work?
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.760]   So you download Mahalo pages instead of getting ads from Mahalo, you're getting ads from somebody
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.320]   else who's buying.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.840]   No, no, no, the way it works is they will sell this data.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.120]   So it's not going to happen for all advertising.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.600]   They basically go to the advertisers and to the double clicks, and to those kinds of
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.560]   people and say, if you would like to buy our targeting service, we've targeted these
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.560]   users on our network.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.240]   So then it's not inserting ads in.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.080]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   So they can work with existing ads.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.720]   Oh, that's really important.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.560]   But they'll say, they'll say the Yahoo, when our users are using Yahoo, we'll let you know
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.000]   what they've been looking at recently.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.040]   So Yahoo gets better results.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.040]   Right.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.920]   So they publish this by this service as well.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.400]   And so it's like, Tocoto also tried to do this, which was they tried to get us that
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.800]   Engadget and Auto blog when I was running it to put tags on our page and then they would
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:41.280]   give us 30% of what those users made for other advertisers on other publisher sites.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   I'll take that.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:47.160]   So when there was an ad on another site, they would say, let's say Gizmodo was part of this.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:51.480]   Gizmodo would get 60% the advertisers, and then we would get 30% and then Tocoto would
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   get 10%.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.720]   Let's say it's absolutely not.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.720]   Why not?
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.720]   This is a win for everybody.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.720]   No, it's not.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.080]   Because what happens is that you have more people selling your inventory, and I wanted
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.480]   there to be only one place to get the inventory at a high price.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.320]   And I don't like people being able to buy my inventory through somebody else like that.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   No, I agree with you.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.200]   You know, a charter actually got a couple letters from Congressmen on Friday too.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.920]   Yeah, no, there was that's because they were confused.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.400]   I mean, if the Twitter panel is confused, the Congressmen are going to be lost.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   All right.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   So I feel better about it.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.200]   It doesn't sound quite as nefarious as I thought.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.120]   I thought they were replacing ads as I was surfing.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.120]   No, that would be totally illegal.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.440]   They would be like at hijacking.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.160]   They're selling the data to other publishers to target ads.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.560]   And how do you think consumers feel about that?
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.560]   The consumers might.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.200]   I mean, don't they win because they're going to get ads that are more targeted to their
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   interests?
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   The answer is consumers don't care.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.280]   You know, they see the same number of ads.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.960]   If they're more targeted, it makes them frankly, when they're more targeted, it makes them feel
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   better.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.360]   So it's not an issue there.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.360]   It is an anti-competitive issue, and there is going to be some issues about that.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   All right.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:03.160]   More importantly, Houston is being overrun by ants that are eating electronics.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.160]   Can you fill us in on this, Dwight?
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.400]   This sounds like a terrible, terrible problem.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.120]   Well, it's these little tiny ants.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.440]   They're called Raspberry Crazy Ants.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.440]   Oh.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.520]   They're named for the guy who discovered them in the US.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.480]   Apparently, they came over on a cargo ship into the port of Houston, and they started showing
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.840]   up on the southeast side of town.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.480]   Although I've seen them, I saw them several years ago, I used to live up by the compact
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.960]   campus on the northwest side of town, the old compact campus, and I saw them there.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.680]   But they don't move in like the straight little lines that you see ants move.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.240]   They move kind of haphazardly almost randomly.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240]   They're crazy.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240]   They're crazy.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.720]   They're crazy.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:50.240]   And they can cover more ground this way and find food quicker is the theory.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:56.560]   They also are very attracted to electrical current as are a lot of ants.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.000]   In fact, fire ants in the same way.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.680]   I don't know if there are fire ants where any of you guys live.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.040]   They're a real problem down here in the southwest.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.640]   Fire ants are soft.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.720]   They're awful.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:12.280]   And you'll see sometimes, like you'll see the green underground electrical transformers
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:16.200]   around here, you'll see a lot of times a fire ant mound piled up against it.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.040]   So ants are used to that.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.960]   Or all ants are interested in electrical current.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   But here they've been getting into people's computers if they get in the home and essentially
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   gum them up.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.360]   They'll get into the fans.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.600]   They'll get thick enough in there that they can cause heat problems.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.920]   That's disgusting.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.680]   It is disgusting.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:42.920]   We had in a townhouse I was living in in San Antonio years ago, we had fire ants get
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:48.840]   into an outdoor air conditioning compressor and gum up them.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:55.760]   Sorry, I was envisioning fire ants being shot through your AC at high.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:02.040]   This is worse when the repairman came to take the compressor apart.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.080]   He pulled the motor out and it was sticky.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.760]   So this happens a lot down here.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.400]   So Dwight, my understanding is with these ants.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.200]   And by the way, there's an ant in Hawaii I've seen before that has the same characteristics.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   I don't know if they're related.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:24.120]   But anyway, I understand that these ants take on the fire ants and push them out.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.360]   Ant fight.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.000]   They eat fire ants.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   So that's good.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   Yes.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   Do they taste like raspberry?
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Mmm.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.920]   I don't know.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.720]   Let's pause for a moment for a word from our sponsor audible.com/twit.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.840]   You know audible is the home for great audio books.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.320]   I'm thinking probably on that flight to Sydney.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.160]   By the way, Jason got recognized.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.240]   Oh, beautiful.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:51.280]   He got recognized on the flight to Sydney by a twit listener.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.520]   And you said, I said, now I know what it's like to be like be Kevin Rose.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:59.920]   It was crazy guy was sitting next to me is like, Oh, how you doing?
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   Ways are not?
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   Where's the not?
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.160]   And I love when you in Devorak and how's the Tesla and he means the guy had every piece
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.320]   of information about our lives and it was awesome.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   He's like, can I take a picture?
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.080]   I was like, yeah, of course.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.480]   I was like, wow, can I sign your booby?
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.400]   You know, like it's okay because you're in first class.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.280]   You're not going to run into the low life.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.120]   So actually, I don't.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   Okay.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.720]   So I remember where you were traveling with me back with the cattle on on Virgin America.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.320]   Are you taking a mirror to Jason?
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.920]   Jason, Jason and I ended up seated next to each other on a flight back from Vegas.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.640]   No, that was a fluke.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   That was a flu.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   How did that happen?
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   Oh my God.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.640]   I can't play the bass.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.560]   Hold out the first class carpet.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.800]   I'm sitting in the back.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.600]   Did you see the guy who's suing JetBlue?
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.080]   There's a, we'll get back to the aisle by in a moment.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.920]   There's a guy suing JetBlue.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.040]   He gets to the counter.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.520]   The counter, the person says, I'm sorry, the flight sold out.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.880]   And he says, Oh, no, I got to be on this flight.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.520]   So there is a JetBlue employee who's deadheading on the flight.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.920]   You know, she's going to ride no seat.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.400]   She says, I'll give up my seat and I'll fly in the jump seat.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.400]   So the guy says, thank you.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.240]   It gets on JetBlue.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.080]   Gets a regular seat about two hours in the flight.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:16.280]   The captain comes back and says, I'm sorry, the, our employee is really uncomfortable.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.480]   She wants her seat back.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.160]   You can sit in the toilet for the rest of the flight.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.720]   The guy is suing because he says, I'm sitting on the John on this flight for three hours.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   There's no seat belt.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   The turbulence.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.440]   I'm getting very scared.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.120]   He's, sounds like he's got a good case.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.000]   I can't believe a captain would do that.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.960]   That seems pretty awful.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.560]   Maybe you really liked the flight attendant.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   I don't know.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.720]   Anyway, that's, that's neither here nor there and it has nothing to do with audible.com.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.560]   Did you listen to any audio books, Jason, on the flight?
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560]   Interesting.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.360]   You mentioned that, Lou.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Confessions of an economic hitman.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.840]   It's a book that's been recommended to me like over and over again.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.280]   And, you know, I'm a busy guy.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.040]   I don't have a ton of time.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.200]   And I went out on Audible and lo and behold, on Audible.com, confessions of an economic
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.200]   hitman.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.920]   And I'm listening to that great book really intriguing.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:13.240]   It's about how these economic hitmen have gone out and loaned money to all these countries
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.880]   around the world.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.640]   Then the money goes directly to American companies to, what's happened over the last
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.160]   couple decades, to build out their infrastructure.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:25.080]   And then they owe that money back to the United States and the United States can then go put
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.320]   military bases and whatever.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.240]   And it basically just, it was like,
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   Yeah, I just wore that.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240]   I recommended this a long time ago.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.240]   John's been, but.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   What did he?
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.800]   He has a new book, the economic hitman guy.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   Doesn't he?
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.280]   He's got a new book coming out.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   John?
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.480]   Well, you know, the guy is, you know, the problem is, there's a couple of things about
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.240]   that book that are interesting.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.240]   First of all, I think it's accurate in some funny way, but the guy's been discredited.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   That's what I think.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.520]   I'm wondering if it's just like, you know, Carlos Castaneda writing about.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.600]   No, no, I don't think it's that at all.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.640]   I think the guy's been discredited for other reasons.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.160]   I think the idea is that you don't want to, you know, anybody taking this book too seriously
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.040]   because then you start re-evaluating, you know, what you see when you take it, when you
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.640]   in the analyze what's going on.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640]   So.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.280]   And we talked about this last week with the, with the discipline and investor, Andrew Horowitz,
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.480]   who suggested, and I think this is true, that it's being turned, this exact ploy is being
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.160]   turned on us with the Chinese.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.880]   That their economic imperialism against us now.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.760]   Well, yeah, that's made, there's possible.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.280]   But anyway, the point is that I think it's an enjoyable book.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.000]   You should just read it and then take it and then consider it.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.880]   But his newer stuff is not going to be the same.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.960]   This was a one-shot deal.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.800]   Do you think he's, so you don't, you don't think he was making it up?
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.760]   You think he's been discredited because it's too dangerous.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.440]   Well, I don't know about how dangerous it is, but it's not the kind of thing you want
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.600]   to, you want everybody.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.080]   The entire American public should not be believing this because it's not in their best interest.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.480]   It's very profitable and they don't want it stopped.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   They.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.280]   It's like serious Xbox stuff.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.880]   It is Xbox, yeah.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   If you believe, if half of it's true, it's really disturbing.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.800]   It's totally credible.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.200]   You don't think it's true?
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   I do.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   Who knows if it's true or not?
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.200]   I mean, I think so far it sounds pretty realistic to me and it seems, anyway, let's
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.600]   not ruin it for everybody.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.960]   Everybody go to audible.com/twit.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960]   Get the book.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960]   Jason recommends it.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960]   The Vorac recommends it.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.200]   This is the only time we're going to agree about something.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.800]   So you have an obligation to go support to it and buy the book.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.480]   I was going to recommend the Chronicles of Narnia.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.280]   No, it's a very nice book too.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.840]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.840]   Anybody die?
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.560]   Where's the jacket?
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.160]   I think Prince Caspian is really cool.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.240]   All right, so we have a, we have a, we have a consensus.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.160]   It's a, at Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.440]   It is our book of, it's really our book of the year.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.320]   I think we started our Audible commercials a year ago recommending this book and thanks
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.880]   to John.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   It's resonating, John.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.760]   And you know, I think what it is, because nobody heard of this book till you started
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.920]   recommending it, I think you.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.680]   I heard about it at a conference too.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.120]   So this is the thing about, you have to love about Audible is you can just take the recommendations,
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.920]   put them on your iPod, whatever device you want, burn a CD, whatever, leave it in the
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.000]   car, leave it in your travel bag.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.200]   And then when you have that downtime, you can do something with your brain besides ruin
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.640]   it on junk food like television.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.640]   I agree.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.320]   It was, it was actually a New York Times bestseller about two or three years ago.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   Oh, well, okay.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.840]   And his new book, which you say is less credible than secret history of the American.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:31.640]   What rarely gets to participate in international conspiracy and write about it twice Leo.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.160]   The next book's probably not as scintillating because we're not taking our countries in it.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.920]   I have to, I will read the next book and send and I'll have an evaluation some other time.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920]   They're both on Audible.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.040]   It's called the Secret History of the American Empire.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.320]   John Perkins is the author, J.O.H.N. Perkins, P-E-R-K-I-N-S.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.760]   You either want to be a great listener and you can get it free just by going to audible.com/twit.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   We love Audible.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   We really love the idea.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760]   I love the idea of audio books.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.760]   We love it.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.760]   Jason, so great.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.360]   I don't fully understand why you do this, Jason, but I thank you for it.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.560]   He's a, he's an economic hit man.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   I'm a fan.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.960]   Listen, if I wasn't a fan, I wouldn't do it.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   We're all fans.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.960]   We love it.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.960]   Tell me Comcast is the sponsor and I'll tell you, I don't know.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960]   Tell me Audible.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960]   I tell you, I know that product.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960]   There you go.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960]   You're a free year.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   It's a great product.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   I'm honest.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   There you go.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960]   I appreciate it.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   Thank you for your support.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960]   That's awesome.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   That's awesome.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   Move along to the dash.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.560]   Now, this is something that, again, I owe you, Jason, this one.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.680]   I didn't know anything about it.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.040]   I'd used Garmin new V's, which I like, Magellan's, which I liked.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.120]   Tom, Tom, I know you're a Garmin fan, Patrick.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.600]   In fact, I really learned about GPS from Patrick who used them early on.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.080]   Garmin, and next day, I really like Mio at the low end.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   Mio's good.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.480]   I know that I hang around my neck.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.000]   That's kind of a walking GPS, and I really like it.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.720]   But I have to say this dash is interesting because, first of all, it's got Wi-Fi.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   It's got GPRS and Wi-Fi.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.560]   It's downloading new maps all the time.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.360]   Here's the thing I think is super cool.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.040]   It sends anonymous information about your travel times up to the server so that when
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:18.720]   you have traffic from other dash users and the travel times are constantly amended so
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.000]   that they're more accurate.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.640]   So when it says it's going to take 15 minutes to get somewhere, it's not just based on some
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.600]   calculation on a map.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.400]   It's based on other dash users, which I think is very cool.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.200]   You can also send your location of where you're going from the internet.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.560]   So that you have to pay for, which that's like $10 extra a month.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.120]   You can go online and say, "Okay, I did this the other day.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.200]   I said, 'All right, I need to go somewhere in Santa Rosa.'
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.800]   And it sends it so I don't have to enter it in the car, which I love.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.800]   Awesome.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   That's a great feature.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.960]   My assistant will be out and my assistant will be like, 'Oh, your next meeting is here
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.440]   at this place and then you go in here tonight and I send them to the dash.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.640]   I turn on my car, boom, it's already there.'
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.480]   Your assistant could do it for you.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   She does and works great.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.160]   So they just opened the platform, which I think is really interesting.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.480]   It's going to be like the chubby of GPS devices.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.480]   Let's open it to you.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.120]   Here's another feature.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   It has Yahoo!
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   Search on it.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:19.520]   So if you search for Starbucks or pizza, it then gives you in distance order the Starbucks
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.880]   or pizza around you, click it and boom.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.400]   And so you can just like, it saves you a thousand clicks on trying to find something.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.920]   And it's pulling data from what I understand from like the internet data sources for traffic
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.480]   data and the units are creating this whole real time traffic.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:40.840]   So every time I leave my house in Brentwood, I have the option of taking the 405 to work,
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.480]   which takes four minutes if there's no traffic or the streets which take 12.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.520]   And I never take the 405 because you know how that can be in Los Angeles, it could be
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.920]   on there for an hour.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.960]   Now when I leave, I look and I say, 'Oh wow, it's green or it's yellow.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   Okay.'
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.160]   And what I think is going to happen is people will knock it on the road when they see red,
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160]   right?
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160]   They just won't.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.360]   If it's like a Saturday or they're going to go to the airport, they'll just change
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   their travel plan.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.040]   I think it's going to have the effect of people not getting on the road when there's traffic
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.040]   jams.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.200]   You know what I didn't realize is what I was using.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.680]   Yeah, you're using OpenMOCO, which I didn't realize.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.800]   The OpenMOCO open source platform.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.000]   They better be really, really, they better be very careful that this doesn't become popular
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   with bicyclists.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.200]   Suddenly it will look as though traffic is really slowed on all the bike paths.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200]   That's a good point.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.200]   I never thought of that.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.640]   I don't think they have cigarette lighters on bikes though yet.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.000]   Well, then they should have had a battery.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.320]   Generated by the wheels.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.160]   So if there's no, if a lot of people in a particular given area aren't using the dash,
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   then I wonder.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160]   Yeah, that I wonder.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   And how popular is this thing?
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   I mean, is this right?
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.600]   Then exactly how accurate is that data that you're getting?
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.320]   I think they only need 50 to 100 in an area to have it be pretty accurate and they've
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.600]   preceded a lot of the major cities and they get the information from the traffic services
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   online.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   So you at least have that.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   And then over time more of these mesh network of dash units will come online.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   Is this the first product?
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   Houston and LA are huge.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.840]   Houston is 600 square miles.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.560]   So you have 50.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.560]   That's not going to do much.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:26.280]   You're going to be relying on the traditionally available IP available traffic data for a long
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280]   time.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.600]   It would take a huge number of these devices in the market.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.200]   I think to make any appreciable impact and accuracy.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   No, not true.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.840]   Not true in the major cities.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.560]   It's already effective in Los Angeles.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:45.280]   Well, yeah, but yeah, LA maybe because you're mostly dealing with the five and the four
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.840]   oh five is the decision half the planets trying to make there.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   I think for San Francisco and Houston where you've got a lot of competing arteries, Manhattan
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.680]   or Jersey, I don't think it's going to help as much till there are a lot of units.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.440]   I think they're preceding it and they're going to give out a bunch of these.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.720]   How long have they been selling this for?
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   I don't know.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   I got mine.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.000]   I met the CEO and I gave him some blogging advice.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.280]   So he sent me a couple of units for free.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.280]   That's why I sent you one.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.280]   Thank you.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   It's an incredible product.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280]   I'm a big fan of it.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.480]   I was going to actually buy it for my other two cars.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yeah, they're four hundred bucks of ask, dash and Amazon for review unit and they haven't
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.840]   sent me one.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.000]   They have communicated to me and that they're interested.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.520]   So it could be that they now have enough people in Houston to make a difference for
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   me to see something.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   That's interesting.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.320]   Yeah, maybe they're holding off until they've got a good story to tell in Houston.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.040]   They also need to sell out their initial shipment to make a difference.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.880]   I have to say, it works pretty well in Petaluma.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.520]   I don't know where it's getting the information from, but I mean, there can't be many gas.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.240]   You're getting traffic information in Petaluma?
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.400]   Well, you're getting the 101 information.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.360]   No, I'm getting street traffic.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.120]   Yeah, it's a street traffic.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.680]   It will tell me cross streets like D Street, which is historically pretty busy.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.280]   It's actually been fairly accurate on how busy D Street is, which is pretty surprising
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280]   to me.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.080]   Maybe there are a lot of dash units there.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.880]   Also in cities like Houston and also in California where everybody has the electronic
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.080]   toll pass here, they call them easy passes.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.400]   In Houston, they read those all along the freeway.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.880]   So in order to do the traffic maps, that's how they do a lot of it here.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.480]   And I suspect that that may be what's happening in the cities where they don't have a lot
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   of dashes yet.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.920]   And I'm reading the traditional traffic agency data that's coming out.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.520]   Yeah, but D Street and Petaluma, I find fascinating that we've actually had.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.280]   I don't know how it knows.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   And you know what?
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.480]   It's funny, as soon as you get, there's a certain point on D Street where it opens
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:43.400]   up because you're getting out to the country and immediately it goes from orange to blank.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.160]   It doesn't have any, it doesn't, it's fine.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   It doesn't have any information.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.560]   Does it basically do a color overlay over the street on the street?
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   Yes.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.320]   It's red, green, orange, yellow.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   I don't know exactly.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.280]   And so you're getting that for streets in Petaluma.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   That's fascinating.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.280]   Isn't that why?
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.280]   I'm actually...
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   I'm telling you, this thing is really intriguing.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.920]   I love it that it's based on OpenMOCO.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.720]   That was the cell phone design that everybody's, oh, we're going to make a cell phone that
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.360]   will compete with the iPhone and everything.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.640]   I don't know where OpenMOCO stands right now.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:18.920]   But the fact that they're basing it on an open source platform like this really is intriguing.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.800]   It's also less expensive.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   But it also means when they have it, they now can have a developer platform, right?
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   That people know how to develop for.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.800]   You're able to put your own applications on there.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.720]   So for example, I don't know, Yelp could make an application for it.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.920]   And so you could just say, click over to the Yelp application and be like, here's what's
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920]   going on.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.280]   Or somebody who's got like, upcoming.org could show you events going on, like tonight,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.160]   on the map and take you to them.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   I think they should...
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.680]   There's an argument when you think about planning in cities and stuff like that in traffic and
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.920]   congestion problems, the cost of making every car have one of these for a similar device
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920]   might be less.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.520]   We must have a dash.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:06.480]   Yeah, it might be actually less to have this than to actually build out roads because in
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.920]   some cases, because the problem is...
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.920]   Just be more efficient.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   More efficient.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.920]   More efficient.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.840]   I've gotten off the highway in LA and taken one of the...
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.080]   Because that's the other thing it does is it's like, by the way, there's alternate
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.400]   route on the street is faster than the highway route.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.960]   So you just switch over, boom.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.600]   Well, they'll actually have data that they can sell back to municipalities and others.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.160]   They should just give it away.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.160]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.240]   It should be like, mandatory building to cars.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.240]   Good.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.520]   So I think what's, to me, what's also interesting about this is it's the intrusion of social
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.960]   networking, which is clearly very powerful online, into devices.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.360]   And boy, you can really see some value.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.120]   I think you and I, Patrick, were talking about the notion of this, of cars talking to one
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:48.440]   another and talking ahead of time about what's the conditions like up ahead.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.560]   This is an implementation of exactly what you were talking about.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.800]   Imagine if they put a thermometer in it, you could actually get the exact weather in different
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   locations.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.800]   As you're getting them.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.320]   Like on a across the entire mesh network, you know, like here's a temperature everywhere.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.360]   It'd be like having 100 million thermometers hooked up to a network.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.720]   You could see an overlay of the entire country's weather.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.560]   Yeah, though the...
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.800]   As long as they position the thermometers in the right location.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   Right, I like R.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.400]   I'm gonna ask you guys a little bit about this.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.200]   The Orphan Works Bill, have you been following the Orphan Works Bill?
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.800]   This is a copyright law that has been hotly debated.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.880]   The idea, by the way, they're using Twitter to do the, to do markup on this thing.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   Which is pretty...
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.880]   Yes.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880]   Theo, I'm sorry.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.880]   I gotta take the baby and put him down.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.880]   All right.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880]   Put him down.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   No, don't do it.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.880]   Don't do it.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.640]   Another poor choice of words.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.840]   I apologize to all the parents in the audience.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.240]   Although some of them overlay more than others.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.760]   Now he just, I gotta put him down.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   How's he doing?
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.240]   How's he... he's a sweet little boy, I bet.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.720]   We've actually had a diaper change while we've been on and he's just got...
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.720]   He has put some dot holiday.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.880]   It is common, isn't it?
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880]   Molly's changed diapers.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.680]   They changed John's diapers twice actually.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   Yeah, and she's a couple.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.480]   Three times, you get over it.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.680]   It's like a NASCAR pit crew over there.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.920]   John, I had the Tesla for a week.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   It was incredible.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.480]   I thought you bought one.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.160]   Patrick, we'll see you later.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.160]   Thank you, Patrick.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.160]   Take it easy, guys.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   Bye-bye.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.920]   Before the Tesla conversation starts because Patrick won't want to leave then.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.320]   Yeah, they loaned me the...
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   Did you buy...
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.440]   Somebody said you bought the number one's car.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.880]   No, I wish I could.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.560]   I have one of the cars over a hundred.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:34.440]   But the number one car, I know the chairman of the company, one of the investors, and he
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.240]   loaned me the first production model for almost a week.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.440]   And it is unbelievable.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.440]   It is so fast.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.160]   It is like driving like an X-Wing fighter or something.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.000]   It's unbelievable.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.040]   And it's totally quiet.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.040]   And it's faster than the car.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.040]   I want one so badly.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.040]   I just...
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   You said you...
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.840]   Let's go forward the topic at hand.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.840]   We're going to get back to it.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.040]   I'm just saying, I wanted to just make just where John knows that they are shipping them
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.440]   now and there's a showroom in Atlanta.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.840]   Yeah, so you have yours?
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.240]   All right, John.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.760]   You may have been right about Microsoft a couple of months, but Microsoft is still going to
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.240]   get Yahoo, probably.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240]   And I'm going to get my Tesla.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.240]   He's going to get a Tesla.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.240]   And to be...
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.240]   Just wait.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240]   Just wait.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240]   Sorry.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.640]   Do I get to get a ride in it or what?
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.640]   Absolutely you're going to get a ride in it.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:23.040]   I can just have to make sure they have a defibrillator, defibrillator, ratchet for you in case something
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.040]   happens.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   We can restart your car.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.440]   It's a good one.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.440]   All right.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   You're just killing me, Jason, with this material.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.440]   All right.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.440]   Thank you.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.440]   I'm here three more nights.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   I'm trying to build Sydney, Australia.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.000]   And you sit on the stage.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.240]   Are you at the chuckle hut in Sydney tonight?
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.760]   I'm at the chuckle hut in Sydney opening up for Carrotop.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:50.720]   So the orphan works is a new copyright bill, which has been hotly debated.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.760]   The US Register of Copyrights, Marabeth Peters said, "This is why we need it."
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.760]   People will go...
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   She used this as an example.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.000]   They'll go to a photographic shop with a photograph.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.280]   An old photograph, they want retouched.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:10.360]   The photographic shop will say, "No, you have to produce evidence that you own this photograph,
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.040]   that you own the copyright to it before we can are allowed to retouch it."
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:19.840]   Or there are many, many previously copyrighted works that no one cares about.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.840]   No one's claiming.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.080]   I remember Larry Lessig very famously introduced the idea of having a copyrights renew, but
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.800]   you have to pay a dollar for it just to assert that somebody cares enough about this.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:40.720]   So the idea of the orphan works copyright law is that a photo or a book or some sort of
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.120]   artistic work that is presumably still under copyright, because the copyright has gotten
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:53.840]   so long, is an orphan work if no one steps forward and says, "Yeah, we own the copyright."
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.400]   It can go out, in effect, go out of copyright prematurely if no one asserts that they want
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   it.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.880]   The photographers are very upset about this.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:11.640]   I think Howard Berman and Patrick Leahy introduced us, "The orphan works act of 2008, allows new
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.400]   creators to use old works without fear of lawsuits provided they've made a good faith
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.760]   effort to fight out if the work is copyrighted."
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.600]   It seems to me a sensible law.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.960]   Has anybody ever been following this, John?
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.240]   No, I've been following the basic trends.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.240]   Look at the close.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.640]   I mean, I mean, I've talked about this a number of times.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.400]   What does Larry Lessig think of this?
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.120]   He thinks it's a disaster what we have, which is a bunch of orphan works that are floating
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.880]   around out there that nobody knows who owns the copyright.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.680]   The person may have written a thing is dead.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.240]   The publishing company's been bought and sold and bought and sold a half a dozen times.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:51.320]   You don't even know who, if somebody did own the copyright, it's impossible to figure
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.560]   out who, and there's probably a lot of publishers out there right now that don't even know they
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.480]   own some of these copyrights.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.440]   Meanwhile, the fear is that, yeah, you could probably republish some of this stuff or use
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.600]   the material over time, but the real problem is that the one guy out of a hundred that
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.400]   you roll out his thing, nobody could find that this guy even lives.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.600]   And the next thing you know, he's suing you for $100 million.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.600]   You're at an extreme risk to do any of this stuff, and there has to be a law to prevent
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.280]   this because the public domain is very important and it's very valuable.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.280]   It's our commons.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.080]   It's our, now I'm going to give you Dwight, I don't know if you want to argue on the
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.640]   other side, but your colleague Nick Anderson, who's an editorial cartoonist at The Chronicle,
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.800]   is very upset about this.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.560]   He says copyright, this is basically flushing copyright law down the tubes.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:41.080]   He says, you know, this legislation imposes an onerous burden on copyright holders like
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.640]   me to protect my work.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:53.120]   Yeah, he's taking the issue that, you know, if you have a work that you're not diligently
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:20:00.880]   sitting on that somebody can claim that they have done the due diligence that's required
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.800]   by the law and then take it and do what they want.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:09.640]   And you know, I'm not familiar enough with the law to know exactly what it's saying constitutes,
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   you know, the good faith search, but it seems to me that it does leave a lot of room for
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.000]   somebody to just walk in and say, yeah, I looked for this and here's documentation to
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.120]   prove it and I'm going to go ahead and use it.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:28.000]   I don't think, on the other hand, you have, it's particularly a big problem with software,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.760]   particularly with old games and older programs.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:35.600]   As John said, where people have traded or have acquired companies and sold companies,
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.960]   who owns it.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:44.680]   It is a real big issue with software people online trade as wares, you know, software
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:49.120]   like this and who knows whether it has any ownership or not.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.880]   Public knowledge is behind it and, you know, we get the real issue here is getting Larry
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.880]   Lessig.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.280]   Now, Larry is taking the month of May off.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.960]   He's off the grid until June.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.640]   So we will get him on to talk about it as soon as he gets back.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.480]   But the problem is this is moving pretty quickly.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.560]   The bill is, it just came out of committee.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.320]   It's sailing through Congress.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.040]   Congress seems to really want to pass this.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:18.600]   There's kind of unilateral support from the registrar of copyrights and public knowledge
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.440]   who are usually at odds over this stuff.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.920]   And yet a lot of copyright holders, including a lot of photographers, illustrators are very
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920]   upset about this.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.480]   Well, what's the period of time?
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.680]   Leo, what's the period of time for the, that it has to lay fallow before it becomes available
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.680]   under this?
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.920]   What, what's the timing of it?
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.600]   I'm, you know, that's a, okay, that's a very interesting question.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.960]   I think that you just have to, let me, let me look and see.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.000]   How often do you have to, you know, you don't have to re-up.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.240]   I mean, the, the point of what Larry's.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.280]   I think what they need to, what they want to do is create a database that you could
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.280]   search.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:57.560]   But there's so many things that are, I mean, that's the internet age where it's so easy
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.760]   to create something that's just unrealistic.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   The internet is the data.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:05.480]   What copyright holder does emerge later, you can, you know, he can pursue it.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:11.240]   He just, he can't, he can't seek a punitive damages.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.000]   So the statutory damages are over, which is really a big problem.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.080]   These damages are massive.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.920]   You can, you can claim compensate reasonable compensation.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.040]   Is it going to be very dangerous because a lot of copyright holders will enlarge large
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:31.040]   archives of work and the burden to catalog all this stuff and then submit it and, you
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.600]   know, it's going to basically create all these ambulance chasing kind of people or people
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.640]   who try to basically deliberately steal stuff, knowing that the penalty is going to be low.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.320]   We already have a massive problem with people stealing stuff.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.120]   We don't need to give them any excuse.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.120]   People misinterpret.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.320]   Well, before you, before you use them, you have to file a notice of use with a copyright
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.400]   office.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:55.560]   You have to provide whatever attribution information about the original owner you can find.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:02.000]   There is a special orphan works symbol that would be put on these uses.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.160]   So that if you see your picture used and it has this orphan works symbol, you have, you
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.640]   know, you have some recourse to say, no, it's not an orphan works, but you can't pursue
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   statutory damages.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   Right.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.480]   So if you took my orphan work, it was an orphan.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.520]   I did, as I said, he used it in a magazine, the normal use.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.960]   Yeah, you have to give me market value for it.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.400]   God, I could see this just overwhelmed in the copyright office with claims.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.920]   I don't see it that way.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.640]   You know, you're making sense of people out there looking to steal content left and right
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.200]   because they can.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.600]   When fact of the matters, this is mostly about stuff that is, nobody wants to be floating
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.120]   around in the public domain.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.840]   It's not about, you know, taking something from one of this, this guy from the Houston
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.680]   Chronicles, a photographer or illustrator, whatever he is, who's their old paranoid,
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.240]   those people because they do get ripped off a lot.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.480]   But this usually by the people, their publishers, will not buy that, you know, somebody out
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.200]   in the middle of nowhere.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:58.160]   And if something became really popular, then it wouldn't be a big deal to pay off the guy,
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.480]   you know, at the normal market rates.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:05.240]   The fact of the matter is in publishing today, there's a lot of accidental plagiarism that
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   takes place.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:11.400]   You get somebody that comes in and they sell you something and you put it in, it turns out
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.520]   they stole it from somebody else and you can't have any recourse and then the original author
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.520]   comes along.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.960]   Typically in publishing, they do a deal.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:21.720]   There's no big lawsuit that's involved if you're not trying to screw somebody.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.880]   You can use the sentence.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.520]   We had a definition in my telecom book that I wrote back in the 1980s, that first one.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.000]   And there was a couple of definitions in there that were apparently taken from somebody else
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.280]   and it went from hand to hand to hand and ended up in the book.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.760]   And so it was just in the glossary.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.160]   And the publisher, it was like a $10 deal.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.680]   We gave him a check and that was the end of it.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.200]   I mean, that's the way it works.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.120]   Yeah, I don't know where I sit on this.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.200]   I really want to hear from Larry Lastic.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.160]   It sounds like something that Larry has been in favor of in the past.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.200]   I mean, it's very clear there are a lot of great orphan works out there that are nobody
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.440]   wants but because of the copyright law.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:06.520]   And part of the problem is that the copyright law, the Disney extension, as long as Walt
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:11.000]   Disney asserts the copyright to Mickey Mouse, that copyright law will continue.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.320]   So anything after 1924 is copyrighted.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.080]   And a lot of 90% of that stuff nobody wants or cares about.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.640]   But it's not in the creative comments.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.520]   It's not in the public domain.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.000]   It can't be used by anybody.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   And that's what Larry is pointing at.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.560]   I think I never say, I mentioned there's a cost to filing that document, which then
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.880]   I would have to agree with John's point.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880]   That would be a burden.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:31.880]   Because that would be a massive throttle.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:37.880]   You know, like nobody's going to steal stuff that they put in $150 or $400 paperwork.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.480]   You know, but on the other hand, artists are creating, oh no, or claiming, oh no, there's
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.680]   going to be a price for a registering our stuff.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.240]   So that would put a burden on the rights holders or maybe an unburdened, undue burden of diligence
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.680]   anywhere on the rights holders to protect their copyright.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:56.080]   You know, it's a there are definitely two sides to this.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.680]   It is it is difficult.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680]   It's something we have to address.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.160]   And again, I think Larry, because he's the bin, the point man on this stuff for so long,
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160]   he's missed.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.840]   He needs we need him in the conversation.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:09.280]   So when he gets back from his month long vacation, he does that every year.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280]   Smart guy.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.880]   We will address it.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.880]   I'm going to go to the zoo.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.640]   Are you going to the zoo, the Sydney Zoo?
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.480]   Yeah, I'm going to go or either that.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.960]   I'm going to go to breakfast at bills, which is a famous place at breakfast there yesterday.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.120]   It was great.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.840]   And I saw Mark Pesci, if you remember him.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   Really smart guy.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.840]   I had breakfast with him.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:29.840]   He's down here.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.840]   He's in Sydney now.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.760]   He's in Sydney and he does a TV show that's like the dragons den in England where they do
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   like inventors and stuff like that.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:37.760]   Oh, cool.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.760]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760]   That's great.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760]   Any tips for Sydney?
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.760]   I was only in Tasmania and I'm sad I missed Sydney.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.000]   I would have loved very much to see more of it.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.840]   We have to do a twin road trip at some point.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   I want to get awesome.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.680]   We get like four guys to go somewhere.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.680]   Deal.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.840]   And I think that I know for a fact that we would be we're invited to Australia to do
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.000]   that for sure.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.080]   The problem is getting all you guys to go anywhere at the same time.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   Is this plan an out six months, six months ahead?
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.240]   I would make a trip out of it.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   It'd be fun.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240]   It'd be fun.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   Me and John and Sam.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.040]   You could have a cage match every Sunday night.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.040]   Share with Cheryl.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.040]   Real with me.
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.040]   Be correct.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.040]   Two beds.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.480]   And if it's okay with you, I'll carry your bag.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480]   You bet.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.480]   That's right.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.520]   Hey, don't ever we can take my bed if you want.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.560]   Are you going snorkeling?
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.440]   Are you is that what you're down there?
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.480]   No, I'm given the keynote at seabed, which is a sort of becoming a big deal down here.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   And then I'm going to go for three days to the Great Barrier Reef and dive the reef.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.760]   So if I could take him by a shark, it's been nice knowing you guys.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760]   It's been a blast.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.760]   We'll call him one.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760]   Oh, come on.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.920]   We're not going to get that lucky.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.560]   Do I get the cards?
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.560]   I want to tell you.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.600]   I'm going to leave my Tesla into John DeBora.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.080]   Hey, what about me, man?
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.080]   I'm going to leave my jazz unit to Leo.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080]   Thank you.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.040]   All right, Jason, have a great time in Australia.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.040]   Enjoy your trip.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.040]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.360]   I'm really pleased we get you on.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.440]   We didn't we didn't know if it had worked from Australia, but it did.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   Jason Kallen.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   I'll see you later, Mike.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.320]   Mahalo.com, M A H A L O dot com.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.480]   Doug K is at IT conversations.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.680]   Now you sold your company, right?
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.680]   No, no.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.680]   Well, we had a for profit company.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.680]   We sold to Padanga.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.680]   We're not a company.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:11.680]   We had a product.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.640]   We sold to Padango, but conversations network is a 501 C 3 nonprofit, the host of IT conversations
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.080]   and a scoop for your Leo and family listeners.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.080]   Yes.
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:24.320]   0 8 conversations dot com, a new site launching today.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.040]   Actually, it's our nonprofit coverage of the election in combination with or in collaboration
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.960]   with the public radio exchange.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.600]   Oh, that's we need that.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   That's wonderful.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.600]   0 8 conversations dot com.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   That's the easiest.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600]   There are lots of URLs.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.600]   That's the easiest one to get.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.600]   So you've just got our first show just went up today.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.640]   It's a 10 minute piece about Ron Paul.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   Ron Paul, the loneliest Republican.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.280]   Well, that's a good way to start.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.120]   Certainly he's got a lot of internet fans.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.120]   That should be interesting.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.600]   We'll be doing, we'll be getting some programs from independent public radio producers starting
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.200]   one a week and then ramping up as we get towards November.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   Excellent.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.200]   Doug, that's exciting.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.200]   I'm glad you could announce that on the show.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.200]   Thank you.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.480]   0 8 conversations dot com.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.040]   Doug K, really a pioneer in this business.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.520]   I thank you so much for being here.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.520]   A pleasure.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.520]   I'll tell you a little bit about the development of the show.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.

[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   I'm going to talk about the development of the show.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   My little gauge here on the name dropping dropped to zero.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.520]   Now the machine is not working as well.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.520]   It's a counter.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   You have a little counter?
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.520]   Every time he drops the name.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.520]   Sometimes if spin is really fast, you don't need to --
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.520]   I think it's up to 150 tonight.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   Jason's a character.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.520]   Just send me some followers, John, because I'm only 52 ahead of me.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.520]   Hey, what's the deal with that?
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.520]   How did Kevin Rose start catching up to you?
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520]   I had 17,000, by the way.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.520]   I was the one who was following me because now I did.
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.520]   I found out I'm in some Derby.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.520]   Yeah, we're in a Derby altogether.
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.520]   If you go to twitterholic.com, they have a link to it.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:12.520]   Twitterholic is one way to follow.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.520]   It doesn't update as much. I like twitter, twitdir,
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.520]   T-W-I-T-D-I-R.com.
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   Twitterholic shows you who's on top.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.520]   They started a hub dub.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.520]   They started a Twit Twitter Derby.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   Kevin is currently 67% chance to be the most followed by midnight,
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520]   and he's only got a fifth.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.520]   You're only have 11% chance.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.520]   I only have a 19% chance.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.520]   I don't have a shot at Kevin. He's headed me by 10,000.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.520]   You're number three.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520]   You're number three on this.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.520]   Jason Calicanis has 19 -- no, he's number three.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.520]   He has 19%.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.520]   Yeah, you have 11.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.520]   Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. Jason has 2%.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.520]   Robert Scobel has 1%.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.520]   Will Harris 0%.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.520]   This is betting. People are betting on this.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.520]   Kevin is currently --
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.520]   I'd have to be like that horse in the preakness.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.520]   We need a surge.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   It says, "John C. de Vorak, coming from the back of the field
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   and not the youngest in the pack, but could be one to watch."
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.520]   Old horse.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.520]   Well, hey, they say for me this --
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   That horse that said horse.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.520]   This gray may be a late starter, but should demonstrate a powerful finish.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.520]   No, no, no. I think Kevin's going to take you.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.520]   Well, he's bribing people.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520]   He says --
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.520]   He saw his Alex. They're both bribing people.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.520]   We're doing it legitimately.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.520]   Well, I was thinking of bribing people.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.520]   I was feeling terrible now.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.520]   I don't want to lose.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520]   Kevin's like nipping at my butt now.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.520]   What's he bribing them with?
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.520]   I don't want to tell people.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.520]   I'll tell them now, because I said he's bribing them.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   Why don't you just do the same thing up the end and make it 2?
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   Well, it didn't work for Jason.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.520]   Remember, Jason was trying to give away a MacBook Air.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520]   Kevin says, "I'll give my old iPhone --
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:46.520]   I'll give my iPhone away -- my old iPhone away to some follower
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   when he gets a new iPhone."
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.520]   I think that's lame. That's lazy.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   That's totally lame.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.520]   And I don't know what is Alex giving away.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520]   What do you get if you follow Alex?
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.520]   He's giving an Xbox -- his old Xbox.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   Say, "Let's give away used equipment."
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   I mean, they're getting people.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   Okay, I'll sign up.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   It's the Dignation Crowd.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   Where's the Twit Crowd in all this?
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.520]   Don't you guys care?
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.520]   You're going to let Dignation beat us on this?
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.520]   Most of them -- most of the Twit Crowd -- I don't think are Twitterers.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.520]   They take their approach to that.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520]   What is this? It's crazy.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.520]   The kids love it.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   The Dignation kids love it.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:19.520]   I don't -- that surprised me, because all the young people on your tour --
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   All the people use it.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.520]   Yes, mostly middle-aged people that use it.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.520]   That's what I find.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   I think the Twitter --
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   It's a bunch of old surfers.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.520]   Maybe that's it.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.520]   Maybe it should give away a surfboard.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.520]   Hey, man.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.520]   Do you reckon Twitter?
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.520]   Twitter.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:36.520]   So what could I give away?
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.520]   I don't want Kevin to beat me.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   Well, it has to be something big and interesting.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   You know, one of the things we're going to do on Twit Live --
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.520]   because we did this when we first started Tech TV ten years ago --
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.520]   Kate and I built the Ultimate Gaming Machine,
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   which in 1998 was a Pentium II 350 with 128 megabytes of RAM.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:00.520]   You know, it was like $12,000 because we had a big, wide-screen monitor.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.520]   What if we built -- I was thinking maybe for Twit Live,
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   we'd build the new Millennium Ultimate Gaming Machine,
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.520]   and then maybe give that away to one of my followers.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.520]   But don't I have to -- aren't there legal rules about contests?
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.520]   Yeah, there are, but they're not that hard to figure out,
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.520]   and you can get a lawyer to help you out.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.520]   These other guys are, I think, you know, going to get thrown in jail.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.520]   We can only hope.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.520]   But anyway, we beat -- but I'll tell you what,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.520]   if you want to opt the ante on that, why don't we do it so we have the main Twit crew.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.520]   For one thing, I need some followers, too, so I'd have to be part of this.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.520]   Oh, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   You want to be in that, too.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.520]   We'll do an autographed case with your signature of mine, Patrick Norton,
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.520]   and then maybe we can trick Kevin into signing it before he knows.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.520]   Yeah, we'll do that. Don't tell Kevin.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:51.520]   Kevin, and we'll give the computer away to some lucky winner that's chosen.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   So we'll choose at random from the followers pool of Leo Laporte,
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.520]   John C. Devorak.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.520]   Who else?
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.520]   I think that's just the -- Patrick Norton.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.520]   We'll make Patrick.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.520]   Patrick's not in the Derby.
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.520]   He doesn't make -- Oh, he's not in the Derby, because this has to be by May 25th.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.520]   So you and me, baby, Jason could give away a test.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   I mean, the best I'm going to do is come in fifth,
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.520]   but at least it'll push me up a little bit on the thing.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.520]   Yeah, you really like down there.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.520]   That's not right. That's not right.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.520]   Well, I got a late start.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.520]   You're a late starter.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.520]   You're a mutter, though, and if it starts raining, you're going to be great.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.520]   All right, John, thank you very much.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.520]   Devorak.org/blog, everybody.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   We'll figure this out.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.520]   I like the idea of building this thing and giving it away.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.520]   So that's what we'll do.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.520]   We'll give it away to a follower on Twitter.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.520]   So we'll choose randomly from somebody following either me or John May 25th.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.520]   I don't know what the value of this will be.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.520]   It'll probably be pretty valuable, right?
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.520]   We're going to make a night.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.520]   We're going to -- and the way we're going to choose the components is we're going to let you guys choose.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   So we'll be doing this on the air.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.520]   Week one will be the CPU week.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.520]   We'll figure out which CPU week two will be motherboard.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.520]   And we'll work our way up, and we'll debate it.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.520]   We'll hash it out with your help.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.520]   So we'll figure out -- so you're going to get what the consensus agrees is the best gaming machine.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.520]   We're going to build it.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.520]   We're going to make it work.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.520]   And then we'll send it to you autographed by everybody on Twitter.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:24.520]   And all you have to do is be following -- should I say -- but not following Kevin?
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.520]   Should I say that?
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.520]   That would be really mean.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.520]   All right.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520]   Colleen's egging me on.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.520]   So it'll be somebody who's following me or Devorak.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.520]   No, you have to follow both.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:34.520]   So here's the deal.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.520]   I'm going to choose a random from somebody following me on May 25th at midnight.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.520]   I will choose a random name from one of those -- whatever -- thousand people.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:46.520]   If that person is following Devorak, okay.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.520]   If that person is following Kevin Rose, that's it.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.520]   You're out.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.520]   And I go to the next person at random.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:56.520]   And Alex Albrecht, if you're following Alex Albrecht -- no, sorry.
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:59.520]   You've got to unfollow both of them.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.520]   I think that's -- okay, it's a little competitive.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.520]   Is it mean?
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.520]   I don't know.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.520]   I'm all alone here.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.520]   Oh, you and me, Doug.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.520]   Do you want to be part of this, Doug?
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.520]   Hey, listen.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.520]   I picked up, I think, 26 new followers since we've been doing the -- I love them.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.520]   I didn't know you were on Twitter.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.520]   I'm following you.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.520]   Thank you very much.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.520]   That much more popular.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.520]   Thank you, dude.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520]   I appreciate it.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.520]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.520]   It's always good to talk to you.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520]   Come up and see us at the new studio soon.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.520]   You know, I was going to come up today.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:28.520]   This isn't a good time.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:32.520]   I want you to wait until everything is just so.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.520]   All the cameras are in so we can get a close-up of Doug.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.520]   We can get a close-up of me.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.520]   I want -- I'm going to do it.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.520]   I'm going to make a special Doug K transition.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.520]   Uh-oh.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:41.520]   You know, it'll be blue.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.520]   And then I'll bring up the good bottle of wine.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.520]   Deal.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.520]   All right.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.520]   We're close.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.520]   We're only a few weeks off from that.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.520]   Yeah, good.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.520]   Thank you, Doug.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.520]   Thank you.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.520]   Thank you all for joining me.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.520]   Don't forget we do this live every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Eastern.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:54.520]   That's 3 p.m. Pacific.
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.520]   That's 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.520]   10 p.m.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:57.520]   UTC.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.520]   I guess we don't say 10 p.m.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.520]   2,200 hours UTC on twitlive.tv.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.520]   You can watch the video.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:09.160]   Listen to the audio and, of course, always download it afterwards because we need your
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.800]   downloads too.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.520]   Through iTunes or through Twit.tv.
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.520]   I'm Leo LaPort.
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.520]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.520]   Another twit is in the panel.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.520]   Going down another at home.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.520]   I didn't mean to.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:27.520]   Seems like we've lost control, but that's the way it goes.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.520]   Another day with Leo.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:34.520]   And then again, just watch you back.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:36.520]   Well, try me see.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:40.520]   Forget us back or check and I'll feel a bit spunky.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.520]   I missed another jump in long game.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:47.520]   I know everything to do with it.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.520]   I'm on the inside.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.520]   And if I miss one, I have a fit.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.520]   I'm a twit.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.520]   Hey, Frank from Tom Castier.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:04.520]   I'm checking out the rock bands.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.520]   Yeah, you can do a 10, 20 megabits, whatever you want.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.520]   We just scrambled a bit for our packets if that's what you would think.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.520]   Because it's not a right.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.520]   It's not a right.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.520]   We use it by BitTorrent, HTTP, HTTPS, and IRC.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.520]   We only block like 12 quarts, 15 Macs.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.520]   It's Kevin Molly Patrick and he's got a wheel of cattle.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.520]   Can I just carry on and cut?
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.520]   You are a murder man.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.520]   It's cool.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.520]   And for will, bring or whiter, scumble, and don't worry.
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.520]   The list is getting longer.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.520]   Don't forget, have a great.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.520]   We're going down, another at-hole, it didn't mean to.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   Seems like we've lost control, but that's the way it goes.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.520]   Another day with Leo.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.520]   I know everything to do with it.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.520]   Round the inside, yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:13.520]   And if I miss one, I have a fit.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:22.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:39.520]   Yeah, I'm a twit.
