[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.920]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, the show that covers
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.640]   the tech news of the week.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.840]   In a unique idiosyncratic, sometimes bizarre fashion,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.200]   I'm Leo LaPorte, joining us in studio today for his first Twit
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.800]   ever.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.520]   We have the lovely and talented Mark Millian
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.960]   from the Los Angeles Times, a youngster
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.880]   just graduated from college.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   So he's going to give us the youth perspective.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.800]   Isn't that-- do you hate being that youth ghetto?
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.960]   No, it's actually a pretty fun role.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.760]   You don't mind.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.600]   No, not at all, especially since I look like I'm 13.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.360]   Works out well for me.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.640]   I was given him a hard time.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.760]   Well, it's nice to have you, Mark.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.600]   I really appreciate you coming in.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.560]   And Mark actually does really excellent coverage
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.200]   for the LA Times.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.880]   And I have to say, in some ways, I
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.600]   think that having a young guy is probably a do-re-gir.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.680]   Wouldn't you say these days?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.880]   I mean, I hope so.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.520]   The old farts aren't really capable of covering these stories.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.240]   Or are they?
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.800]   I don't know.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.400]   Anyway, welcome.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.360]   It's good to have you and Steve.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.320]   I'm really happy to be here.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.960]   We'll find some young stuff for you to cover.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.520]   The youth beat.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.560]   How about that Neopets?
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.000]   Those are hot, aren't they?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.560]   Also here, there's the chuckle of Frank Barnico.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.440]   Good to see you, Frank.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.520]   Somebody a little closer to my age.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.200]   I saw some chia pets in the store this weekend.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.280]   They're coming back.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.680]   They probably saw snuggies at Costco.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.040]   Oh, how funny.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.800]   Yeah, the snuggies.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.520]   Now they have pet snuggies.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.800]   Yep, and they're retail boxes.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.920]   Retail boxes, 1995, Costco all lined up suitable for framing
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   or giving stories.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.320]   Why?
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.800]   Why?
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.000]   Why?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.400]   I don't understand that one at all.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   B-A-R-N-A-K-O.com for Frank's blog.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.040]   Long time observer of the scene with MarketWatch
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.000]   and elsewhere.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.760]   Also here, Mr. Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.400]   Howdy.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.840]   Seen that's weekly daily, you show about--
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.640]   I am neither young nor at old media.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.040]   You're kind of in between.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   Yeah, I'm just sitting on a fence.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   Pick a side writer.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.760]   One or the other.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.160]   Tom and Roger Chang, my other cohort from Tech TV
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.600]   and another one of my cohorts from Tech TV
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   do a great show called East Meets West every Sunday
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   right after Twit on the Twit Network.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.920]   So you can watch them do that show right after this show,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.200]   which we do live every Sunday at 3 p.m. Pacific.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.520]   11 p.m.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.920]   UTC, I guess you don't do p.m.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.160]   2300 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.560]   So I think one of the big stories--
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   there are a bunch of big stories.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.040]   One of the big stories of the week,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.280]   of course, the success of the Droid phone
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.640]   and an interesting number of geeks embracing the Droid phone.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.800]   In fact, I'm ashamed to admit that after reading
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.920]   all these positive posts from even from people like Dave
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.480]   Weiner, my friend Annie Anaco in the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   I actually just ordered a Droid phone.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.840]   Tom--
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.160]   I got pretty close to it.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   Yeah, I don't want to get out of my--
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.920]   I don't want to pay for two contracts right now.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.560]   That's the only thing stopping me because I am attracted
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.440]   to the Droid and I want to try it out over a few months,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.720]   you know, rather than just pick it up.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.880]   Yeah, you can't review it in a week.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.680]   It's kind of weird.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.000]   You can't review it in a week.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.120]   You just can't.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.480]   Because I know that-- I know the network's
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.440]   going to be great here because I use the Verizon
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.480]   Wi-Fi all the time to get data onto my iPhone.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.040]   Well, and there's some really nice features, which
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.880]   I want to talk about in a bit.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.400]   But before I do that, I do also want to welcome.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.480]   He's just joining us now.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.800]   Mr. Will Harris from Channel Flip Resolve.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   Yay.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.640]   Were you having trouble?
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.080]   Well, you know, for all the billions being pumped into Skype
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.200]   this week, it still seems pretty hard to get a reliable
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   connection time.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.440]   I thought the internet might be down in England.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.480]   Well, you know, that happens sometimes.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.160]   No, get some leaves on the lines.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.120]   The tubes get clogged.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.440]   But no, made it finally.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.800]   Yay.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   So lovely to be here.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   Good to have you on the show.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.640]   Welcome.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.680]   Let's see if I can get a shot at you.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.320]   Yeah, there he is.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.160]   In all his glory.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.800]   So we were talking about the dried.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.880]   The dried will not--
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.200]   is a CDMA phone and Verizon here in the States.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.120]   But I saw that O2 Germany is going
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.640]   to sell it as the milestone in Germany.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.960]   So I presume O2 in Britain will sell it as well.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   Well, maybe.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.840]   But I guess we don't have any CDMA networks over there.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.000]   No, no, I'm saying they have a GSM version called the Mihasone.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.280]   They have a GSM version.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.720]   Well, O2 is kind of odd because they've kind of put themselves
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.440]   out as the smartphone network.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.840]   They were the first network over here to have the iPhone
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.120]   because the iPhone's just got multi-network now.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.840]   And they were-- they're the only companies still to have the pre.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.120]   So I guess if they get the droid,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.720]   it'll be kind of three for three.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.920]   Is O2 Germany-- I mean, if they have it,
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   does that mean O2 England will have it or is it?
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.880]   Yeah, usually.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.920]   Should it be the meter stone?
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.800]   Not the milestone?
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.200]   The kilometer stone.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.600]   Kilometer stone, right.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.720]   Yeah, what does a milestone mean in Germany?
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.400]   It means nothing.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.680]   Demutr stone.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.800]   Because droid's so confusing.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   I don't care why they change the name,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.840]   unless there's some copyright thing.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.280]   How much do you think Lucas is making off of droid?
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.400]   Every ad says, "Droiders' registered market book
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.080]   was film limited use with reserve use with permission."
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.840]   I can't believe that Apple hasn't done the obvious thing,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.080]   which is this isn't the droid you're looking for.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   Mmm.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.280]   Too obvious, I guess.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.680]   Mmm.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.520]   Is it too obvious?
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.360]   I don't know.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   That's pretty good.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.240]   They're not reacting to the droid
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.840]   because that would legitimize it.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.480]   They can react to the PC because that's well known
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.640]   as the PC is dominant, right?
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.840]   But if you react to the droid,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.720]   doesn't that legitimize the droid as the competition?
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.000]   Here's the interesting thing with droid.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.920]   Right at the time when you start to think,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.360]   oh, I'd really like this and, oh boy, that two year thing.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.280]   Verizon raises its early termination fee
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.080]   from $175 to $350.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.040]   So, didn't they lose a lawsuit in California
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.560]   over this early termination fee?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.800]   Mark, you must have covered that.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.960]   What?
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   That gives us a good idea about
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.400]   how much they're actually subsidizing this phone.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   They're probably--
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.240]   That's what they're saying.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.960]   They're saying, well, it costs us so much.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.800]   Right.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.920]   We have to charge you.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.840]   I don't know if that's just bad business.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.680]   I'm not sure if that's even fair practice.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.240]   It seems whatever, you know, what other business--
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.640]   if you leave your dry cleaner after,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.000]   you know, I want to go across the street
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.200]   to the other dry cleaner will,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.240]   I'm going to have to charge you an early termination fee
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.440]   because I gave you a bag.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.240]   I don't know of any other business
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.080]   where they charge you to quit.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.360]   It seems like that should be illegal.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   It's one of those businesses.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.120]   This is a very little competition.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.600]   That's how Monopoly's acting.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.320]   You're saying, Tom, you want to defend them?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.040]   Go ahead.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.560]   Well, yeah, if there's a defense for them,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   it's that you have a contract, right?
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.640]   It's that-- and that's why there's a termination fee
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.560]   because they counted on a certain amount of revenue.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.400]   Yeah, they--
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.240]   If you want to get out of the contract.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.600]   You were supposed to make us rich, dammit.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.760]   We gave you that phone, that $500 phone for $200
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   because we were going to make $600 off you.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.080]   So-- Well, wait a minute though.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.640]   Now, let's look at this really though.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.680]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.040]   The droid your plan is going to be about--
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.440]   The plan I signed up for is $100 a month.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.880]   That's including not even unlimited texting.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.440]   If you want unlimited texting, even a little bit more.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.600]   And so that means every month I give them $100
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.320]   over the two year period of the contract.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.840]   That's $2,400 plus the $200 I gave them for the phone.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.280]   So they make $2,600 on a $600 phone.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.920]   And OK, so maybe their services are costing them something.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.600]   But there's some good profit in there.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   It's not like they're not making money every month off of me.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.720]   They want another $350.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.680]   You signed the contract.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.760]   You also signed the contract with--
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.200]   Is your signature, Mr. Little?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.720]   Yes, it's my signature.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.400]   You also signed the contract when you sign up for Facebook.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.800]   That doesn't mean they can slip in there.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.920]   Things like they own your content.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.840]   Right.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.720]   I mean, I mean--
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.360]   I mean, I like--
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.560]   I guess they can do that, unfortunately.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.920]   What is it, Frank?
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.760]   You know, I just wonder about the marketing
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.640]   of the Droid phone.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.000]   It seems like, from the ads I'm seeing,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.360]   it is all aimed at folks who already have the iPhone.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.720]   And isn't that a smaller market that's available that--
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   Droid, you go after them bigger market.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.160]   New people who are trading in all sorts of phones,
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.120]   not just iPhones.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.840]   I mean, these ads are very specific to people
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.880]   who have iPhones who understand that the iPhone is limited
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.240]   and running a number of apps at the same time.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.520]   Well, and they're not just advertising on the fact
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.800]   that it's a smartphone, Frank.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.520]   You've seen the-- they're going right after AT&T.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.920]   In fact, AT&T sued them on these coverage map ads.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.800]   And it has not slowed Verizon down.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.280]   Gizmodo announced today that there
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.920]   are three new Verizon ads that attack AT&T on the coverage.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.200]   So it is not just going after the iPhone.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.680]   It's going after AT&T.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.160]   And you're right.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.440]   I mean, what about Sprint users?
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.640]   What about, you know, T-Mobile users?
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.000]   I guess in a way, if you say, hey, our coverage is better,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.600]   that's something everybody benefits from.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.000]   I think that's actually Verizon's best defense against AT&T
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.880]   and the iPhone.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   Yeah, everybody wants to be in Verizon.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.840]   Right.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.240]   And everybody who's already on AT&T basically says
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.320]   the service is terrible.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.480]   Right.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.600]   Yeah, it could be going after the people who are in the middle,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.240]   too, right?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.960]   And I'm off contract.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   I'm ready to switch.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.280]   I'm thinking about the iPhone.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.800]   But then I see this commercial.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.840]   And oh, wow, that coverage looks pretty awful.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.920]   Maybe I won't get the iPhone.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.760]   This droid thing.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.400]   You know, that might be what they're thinking is,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.200]   let's try to get those people, the switchers,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.400]   to pick the droid from the get-go.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.320]   You know what I think is really going on, Frank,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   is that Verizon is still stung by the fact
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.560]   that they turned down the iPhone.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   So--
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.880]   Well, all the talk about the droid has made me look up
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.840]   and find out when my contract for the iPhone
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.360]   expires.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   Uh-huh.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.120]   The operating system and, especially that GPS,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.800]   that free GPS product, makes the droid look very attractive,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.520]   just on the base of its basic applications and capacities.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.840]   Have you used the GPS?
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.520]   Oh, I used it to get here.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.120]   You did?
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.280]   No, here's something they said.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.000]   Now, tell me that this happened because John Belmont
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.800]   told me that this happened, that when he got to--
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.120]   it says you have arrived, you destination--
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720]   it pops up the street view of--
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   It does.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.280]   So you see that you're here.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.040]   I'm really hoping that--
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.920]   because Google said that they submitted this to the iPhone
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.280]   App Store, that they'll have this free version built
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.040]   into Google Maps.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.320]   Like, Apple's going to allow it.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.040]   We'll see what happens.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.800]   I really hope so.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.320]   Apple has a clear reason not to, though, especially with--
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:06.640]   what is it?
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.240]   Garmin is selling their--
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   $99.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   $99.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   $99.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.760]   And it sucks.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.360]   People are saying it's terrible.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.400]   Hey, Steve Jobs, this is Tom, Tom on the phone.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.240]   About that Google Maps app.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.920]   You're not going to let that go, right?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.840]   No.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.320]   I think what's really interesting, looking at the amount
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.000]   of coverage that the Droid has got,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.320]   is that it really highlights just how pretty much rubbish
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.560]   everything else is on the smartphone market.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.160]   Because I think the iPhone killer has been sort of
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   tagged it for a long time.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.680]   The Droid is a good phone.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.560]   But I've recently had some terrible experiences looking
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.640]   at phones like a new Samsung Tocker phone
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.240]   and a new LG phone.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.720]   And they're all touchscreen phones.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   But they're all absolutely terrible.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.240]   And I think one of the reasons certainly I see that the
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.360]   Droid is pretty successful is that it's an iPhone--
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.440]   it's a touchscreen phone that isn't a complete disaster.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.840]   Because I have to say that there are very, very few of
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.080]   them around.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   You're right.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   There's so little competition.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.640]   I posted a review of the Droid and said it's the second
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.720]   best, if not the best, smartphone on the market.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.680]   Oh, now see, everybody's saying second best.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.000]   Why do you say if not the best?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.480]   What does it that makes it better for you?
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.000]   I mean Verizon's network just from what I--
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Just the network, right.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.880]   And everybody says the iPhone is the best personal
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.920]   computer I've ever owned, but not the best phone.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.040]   Interesting.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.800]   I wouldn't say it's the best personal computer, but--
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.720]   I definitely use it more as a handheld computer than I do
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.760]   use it as a phone.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.600]   I'll give you that.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think what really is compelling about the
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.400]   iPhone is the apps.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.600]   And the way you can use the apps, depending on what you
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.960]   want to do, not obviously turn by turn.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.600]   But things like just when I travel, the ability to kind of
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.360]   blog and post and keep in touch with people, find rest--
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.120]   it's great for travel.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.240]   We were coming home today from State College, as I
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.880]   mentioned, Leo earlier.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.640]   We were coming home from State College and listening to
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.800]   the broadcast of the Redskins game all the way from
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   State College.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.200]   I turned to my wife and said, do you love the Apple pod now?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   That's what she calls it.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:20.800]   The Apple pod.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.400]   The Apple pod.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.200]   As we're listening to streaming radio.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   And she says, this is great.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.400]   And I said, well, you know, it's all part of the monthly
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:27.840]   package.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.640]   It's not data.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.560]   It's just stuff.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.440]   And just that one app almost sold her on her own.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.320]   But try and use that droid out of the US.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.960]   Try to use it when you travel and you're going to have
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.480]   another thing coming.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.240]   That's a negative over Verizon.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.880]   It's CDMA.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   It's not going to work out well.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:43.960]   That's true.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.760]   You'll have nowhere to go.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.800]   It's not a travel phone.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.640]   Somebody's telling me that Orange will have the droid in
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.800]   the UK.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.000]   So does that--
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.440]   does that's attractive?
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.960]   Is that good?
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   Well, it doesn't-- I mean, although I might get kind of
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.000]   blamed for saying this, there isn't really a vast amount
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.200]   of difference between the networks in the UK.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   Because in the US, I guess the coverage is the major
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   differentiator.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.800]   You just hold a little tight little eye on that.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   It's so small.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   You put up one inch.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   That's the whole--
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.240]   Most of the networks in Britain have pretty much 100%
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.160]   coverage.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.160]   And it'll go up and down.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.600]   I mean, O2 in particular has slightly suffered from the
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.960]   same thing that AT&T has suffered from in the past
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.120]   kind of year, which is that the popularity of the iPhone has
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.720]   led to dreadful 3G coverage in certain places.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.240]   I mean, there are areas in the center of London where the
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.040]   3G coverage for the iPhone is just appalling, which I kind
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.240]   of feel is like--
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.520]   I hear that the same is true in San Francisco that it's not
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   so great.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   That's the same.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.880]   And it's because of the 3G.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.600]   It's not that the coverage is bad in San Francisco.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.320]   Coverage, if you look at that little blue map, is actually
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.320]   very good.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   But the cells get overloaded.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.880]   Well, the amount of people in central London just accessing
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.600]   iPhones nonstop is unbelievable.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   So I think the--
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.080]   I think Verizon still might get the iPhone here.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.400]   Well, the rumor-- and as long as you mention that, there's a
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.720]   rumor out that they're going to have the iPhone Q3.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.800]   Which one thing I noticed about these new commercials that
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.640]   Frank was mentioning, none of them have the droid in them.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.920]   They all plug a different phone.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.640]   There's one that has that droid, Aris, the $99 version.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.920]   But they're really positioning themselves as, we're not
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.960]   better than the iPhone.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.160]   We're better than AT&T because we have the better coverage,
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.760]   which they have the map and all those ads.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.800]   But we also have all these amazing phones.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.720]   And granted, the phones aren't really that amazing.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.960]   But they're trying to come off as, look at all the phones we
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.400]   have, look at the better coverage.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.120]   Why would you ever pick AT&T?
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.000]   And getting the iPhone would fit right into that.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.360]   If they could come out next year sometime, maybe in the
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.000]   summer and say, and we have the latest iPhone, now Verizon is
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.920]   the only place to go.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.200]   You want the droid from Google Android.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.560]   You want the iPhone.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.240]   Whatever you want, we've got it.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.400]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   This is the stealth commercial.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.600]   I love this stealth.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.800]   Did you see this stealth commercial?
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.880]   I didn't realize it was a droid ad.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.400]   Is it a droid ad?
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.000]   Because I thought, oh, this is the new sci-fi channel or
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.200]   something.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.400]   It looks like a booty or something.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   So stealth planes flying over all over the US.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   They dropped some sort of payload.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   Alien invasion?
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   Looks like an alien invasion.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   That's what I thought.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   And the first time I saw this ad that didn't identify it,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   it just said, I want it coming soon or something.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   It's V.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   It's V.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   That's why I thought it was an ad for V.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   The new ones are all Christmas oriented or holiday.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   Yeah, they're the coverage map ones.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   I thought this was one of the best produced ads I've ever seen.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   I mean, it just blew me away.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   And then the little capsule opens.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   And then that's all I saw.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   There's an eye.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   And it says drop date 11, 609.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   Oh, there it says Verizon.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   I missed that part, right?
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   At the very, very end.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   So that's the aress or is that the droid?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   That was the droid?
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   I think it was both dropped on the same line.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   Product line.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   You're right that those are some of the best produced commercials.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   Not necessarily so.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   Totally over the top.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   Totally.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   I think that marketing that they're doing with this is just so stupid,
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   though, because they're making it seem like this ominous dark
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   device.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   And I mean, there's a lot of people who are scared of Google already having too much information.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   And they're making this out to be this like rise of the robots, give all your information.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   This will be your personal robot.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   We talked about this on this week in Google yesterday.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   For the first time I can remember in a long time, Google had an ad for the droid on its front page on November 6th.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   So, so you go to Google's front page and you see, you know, get the droid.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   It points to a Google landing page first, but I thought that was wild.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   And it was as good as the ad for Elmo, though, right?
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   Yeah, it was also an ad for Elmo.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   Did you get that in the UK too?
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   Yeah, it was fantastic.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   For the last time.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   They're still doing this.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   They're still doing it.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   If you go to Google.com, which nobody does, I know anymore, but if you go to Google.com today, you'll get Elmo.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   They've been doing this for all week.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   I've never seen such a crazy thing.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   I bet there's a website that seems like a lot.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   Oh, although Google cartoons.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   Little cartoons and so forth.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   And I would think there must be somewhere going years back because they've been creative for years back with just the home page and those illustrations.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   There's another.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   Google that.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.400]   Yeah, Google that.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   Here's one of the, you want to see the Christmas ones?
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   Which ones do you like Tom? The Misfit Toys, Blue Christmas or Elves?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   What do you reckon?
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   The Elves one's pretty good.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   The Misfit Toys is very nostalgic if you like that rank and bass stuff.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   So one of those two.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Oh, they should have burr lives.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   You can only show.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.400]   The Misfit Toys.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   Hey, check out the new guy.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   What are you doing here?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   You can download apps and browse the web.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   People who love you.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   It's an iPhone.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   Then they show the 3G coverage.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   Right in here.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   The world of Misfit Toys.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   5G coverage in AT&T.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   Verizon Wireless is your destination for British?
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   It is.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   HTC Windows phone like the Imagio.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Or the Drogo by HTC for just $99.99.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   So now it's not just the droid that they're advertising.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   But isn't this what they were getting sued over? Is this coverage map thing?
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   I think AT&T might have a legitimate complaint there too because it's 3G coverage.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   And not everybody really understands what that means.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   It's not falling coverage.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   It's not falling coverage.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   It calls in the middle of Montana, which you may not be able to.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   But every Verizon CDMA tower is 3G.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   Not every AT&T tower is 3G.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   But you know what?
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   If this was reversed, right?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   And AT&T came out with a map that had 3G and Edge.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   And they compared it to Verizon's map of just 3G.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   And it looked better for AT&T.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   And AT&T Verizon would sue AT&T for not having a comparable map.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   So what Verizon's doing is technically the exactly right thing, which is 3G versus 3G.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   It's apples to apples.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   AT&T says these ads are causing it to lose incalculable market share.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   That actually doesn't mean a lot.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   It just means we can't figure it out.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   By the way, if you go to google.com/logos.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   Google has it.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   Remember they had the crop circles ones that nobody could explain.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   Look at all of them.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   And this is including stuff that you don't see in the US.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   Yeah, it's all the foreign ones in the US you wouldn't see.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   Day of the day, Mexico was November 2nd.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   We didn't see that one.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   The Halloween candy one was good.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   This is great.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   It goes back in time a long way.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   Rampa Oedigawa's birthday.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   Of course.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   That's an important holiday.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   It is an campaign.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   Awesome.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   So let me play, I gotta play the elf one.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   I mean, as long as we're playing ads.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   They're not paying me for this, by the way, folks.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   But I'll do one that day.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   Get out of jail!
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   Nice.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   These are the elves.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   You can't cook.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   Nice.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   So every elf, okay, let me explain this for people listening.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   Gosh, that's creepy.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   [laughter]
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   Oh my God, is that a creepy still?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:48.080]   Okay, so the elves, particularly creepy looking elves, are loading up presents and they're checking
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   off names and each one as they put the phone, I didn't know Santa made cell phones, but
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.400]   as they put the phone in the package, shows the coverage map.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   And of course, it's the Verizon wireless 3G coverage map which is spreading like blood
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   all over.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   Uh oh.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   You got AT&T.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   Naughty.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   Look, brows in the web, but that one.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   With five times more 3G coverage.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   Hmm.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   Yeah, I might be a little peeved if I were AT&T on that one.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   Doesn't this also give you some hint of how big the cell phone market must be?
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   All the money spent for those ads?
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   Those are incredible.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.000]   AT&T argues its customers can quote, "fully use" is exactly what you said Mark.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.760]   You fully use their wireless devices outside of a 3G coverage area and undisputedly we
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.640]   have coverage in areas depicted by white or blank spaces on the maps used in Verizon's
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.640]   advertisements.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.000]   They say the maps they're using are wrong.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.760]   So they ask for a temporary restraining order.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.240]   I haven't received it so I'm going to keep running those ads.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.520]   Um, interesting.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.520]   I guess the ads are running.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.760]   Have you seen them on TV?
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   I haven't.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.120]   I've only seen them on gizmodo.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.480]   Thank goodness for the web.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   It's kind of a weird thing, isn't it?
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.960]   I mean, most people, I tend to feel like most of the ads that I see that people talk about
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.040]   are ads that I've seen on the web, not actually on TV.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.880]   I mean, when was the last time you saw an ad on TV that was kind of so controversially
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.480]   wanting to talk about it?
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.240]   It doesn't, you don't even, you can spend all the money on making the ad, put it on YouTube,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.280]   and you never need to make an ad buy.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   That's good.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.920]   That's what Caddy does at the time, right?
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.120]   Those kind of two hot for TV ads.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.280]   Oh, yeah, go do D.P.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.440]   Ad pretend they were going to put it on TV and just put it on a website.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.960]   Geez, I hope Audible never thinks of this.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.560]   Well, there was that study recently that said people actually watch a whole lot more ads
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.920]   on their DVRs and their T-vos than they expected.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   They don't whizz through them.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.640]   Yeah, they're not, not nearly.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.120]   I mean, some people do obviously, but not nearly in the numbers that was feared at one
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   point.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   Yikes.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.200]   Actually, let's take a break.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   Now I want to come back.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:04.720]   I went to a salon that was sponsored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation over the couple
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   of days ago.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.280]   John Perry Barlow had it, but all the EFF board was there.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.440]   And they were asking for help from the community in solving what to them is an intractable
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.440]   issue.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.320]   Barlow said even that the board, the EFF board was like struggling with this to the point
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.600]   where they're almost in fistfights over what to do about net neutrality.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.520]   So I'd like to maybe ask all you great big brains in a moment what you think.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.720]   But before we do that, I do want to welcome a brand new sponsor, not only to this show,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.560]   but to the entire Twit Network.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.920]   You sound unhappy, Frankie.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   Okay.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   No, I'm fine.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   I'll just swing back.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.920]   Oh, another one.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   What gives me hope is a breakdown.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   DVR skipper.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   He's going.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:54.360]   Where do I, how do I skip this part?
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.800]   No, don't skip this part.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   This is, I'm really excited.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   I have been, it's funny.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.480]   We were supposed to talk about this last week and there was a delay.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.440]   It's been really hard for me.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.760]   As some of you know, I got a new car about a week ago and I haven't, I haven't had to
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   bite my tongue.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.400]   I actually had to bite my tongue.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.840]   I got a Mustang and it wasn't that I couldn't talk about the Mustang or about Ford.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.120]   It was that I couldn't talk about what was in the car and that's the advertiser.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.320]   It's Ford Sync.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:28.000]   You might have, I saw this first at CES a few years ago, Microsoft's Sync stuff.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.600]   And now that I have it in my car, let me tell you, this stuff is great.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.880]   It's hands-free calling.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.240]   Some of the stuff you may have already seen in other systems, you know, you press the
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.040]   button on the steering wheel, it goes boom.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   You say phone, call Jennifer at home, very, by the way, very good voice recognition.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.120]   You never have to take your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel to do any
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   of this.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.720]   But you can also do things like play, bare naked ladies.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.440]   You can tell it what songs to play is if you're listening to a song on your iPod, you could
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.280]   say play similar songs or next you can get turned by turn directions.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.040]   Even if you don't have a GPS, this is kind of cool.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.480]   You can get serious mobile traffic information.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.600]   It's got, I, every 5,000 miles I have it set to set in the vehicle health report to my
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.040]   phone and put it up on the web.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   And I know exactly the status of about, I think it's about 10 different engine systems.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.400]   It's got 911 assist.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.160]   If the airbags deploy, it calls 911, plays a recorded message, gives me a chance to override
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.880]   it, of course, or to talk to 911.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:44.320]   But if I'm incapacitated, it makes the call and uses the GPS to tell 911 where I am.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.600]   You get news, you get sports, you get weather.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   It knows your route.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.440]   So if you're on a route and you want traffic reports, it tells you what the traffic is
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.880]   on your route as you're going.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.440]   I mean, this thing is so cool.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.280]   I got in the car and I said, "Where's the CD changer?"
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.040]   They said, "Well, I'm just put the CD in."
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.240]   So I put a CD in.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.400]   It goes to CDDB, gets the name and information about the CD, and then rips it to the internal
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   hard drive.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.600]   You could put 2,400 songs on, they call it the jukebox.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   So you don't need a CD changer.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.760]   You take the CD out and you're done.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.880]   You don't need to bring it in the car anymore.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.680]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   There's so many cool features to this.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.160]   You can say, "Play the New York Times front page.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.480]   It'll read you the news."
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.440]   If you have a phone that can handle it, this is a new feature of Bluetooth, it will read
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.440]   text messages as they come into you and you can send them.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:41.080]   I can say, "Hey, text Mark that we're looking for him on Sunday at 3 at the Twigcottage."
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.880]   And it would transcribe it and send it.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   That's awesome.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   It's a pretty smart car.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.480]   I feel like I'm in the kit.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.080]   What was the name of that show?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.080]   I feel like David Hasselhoff.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.480]   Kit, yes.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   It doesn't talk back.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.040]   It does talk back to you and a female voice is very cool.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   So I want you to take a look.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.360]   Here's how this works.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:10.600]   You can go right now to a Sync My Ride podcast.com and find out all the details and enter to

[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   Oh my God.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.480]   I love it.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.120]   And I paid for the Mustang Mike Harrington.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.840]   I paid for it with my own money.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.640]   Didn't even get at this account.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.640]   Let's go.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.080]   Oh, let me tell you.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.800]   This time time you come up here, I'll take you for a ride.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.760]   This thing is so fun.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   What color is the Mustang?
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.280]   It's a little embarrassing.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.640]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   I didn't know.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   It's but is it silver?
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   Like everything else in the world?
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   No, it's bright red.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   It's not pink.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   It's bright red.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   Alright.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   Bright red.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   Oh, no, that's this.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.640]   I know why you think that's embarrassing.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   That's fine.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   My wife said, "What color?"
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   Just tell me it's not red.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.440]   I said, "Well, come on.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.080]   She's a little mad that I bought this."
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.280]   But then I took her for a ride in it and she kind of, she said, "Wow."
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.520]   And then I let her drive it and now she doesn't mind.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.960]   She love this, the 2010 Mustangs.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.240]   This is not the ad, by the way.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.640]   This is not an ad for Mustangs.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.960]   I'm just telling you, I love the 2010 Mustang.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   It is fun.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.240]   I've never had a muscle car, so I'm having a blast.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   Just don't speed because they pull over the red cars first.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.200]   That's what somebody told me, but I am a very careful driver.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.520]   But we live, you know, the area we live in is perfect for something like this.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.760]   There's twisty roads out to the ocean.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   There's a lot of country roads.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   It's really fun.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.520]   I mean, the handling on this, I really haven't a blast.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   It's beautiful out here.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   Isn't it nice?
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.080]   So I'm in the city of L.A. and you live.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   I'm right in the city.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.920]   I'm a southerly guy.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.520]   But you went to school in Maryland.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520]   Right.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.920]   Another lovely, country-fied area, right?
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   Not so much.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.520]   15 minutes from D.C.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.520]   No.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.520]   Not so much.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   No.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.040]   So this net neutrality thing, there's so many stories and this one is really not a story, but
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   not a breaking story.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.160]   We mentioned last week that there's a bill in the house and a bill in the Senate, hands
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.280]   off the internet.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:34.760]   But there's also FCC regulations, which is something Obama promised to keep the cell
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.720]   phone and the phone companies and the cable companies, all these companies from kind of
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.920]   managing the internet.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.320]   And now we get this story, which is a little bit of a shocker so close to this.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:52.840]   The Comcast, the second largest US cable television and internet communications provider, has
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:58.320]   installed a new traffic throttling scheme that is now working in all markets.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.880]   If you are a Comcast customer, you're being throttled.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.560]   Remember, Comcast got in trouble with the FCC.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.120]   In fact, got fined by the FCC for blocking a bit torrent traffic.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.680]   In fact, disconnecting bit torrent connections.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.000]   The FCC said you can't do that.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.520]   And as I guess it's part of the deal, Comcast has to tell the FCC what it's up to.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.600]   They've put in new hardware and software technology at their regional network routers
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:30.000]   to implement a two-tier packet queuing system.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.280]   There are two trigger conditions.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.240]   The first throttling condition, I'm reading this article, Robert Monroe, writing for the
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:40.000]   Inquirer, the first condition.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.960]   And I've thought this is going on for a long time, to be honest with you.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.840]   If you use more than 70% of your maximum downstream or upstream bandwidth for more than 15 minutes,
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   it slows down.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.080]   I think it's been doing this for a while.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.160]   I've noticed.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.040]   It seems to know how much bandwidth I'm using and slows me down.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.640]   The second trigger is tripped when the cable modem termination system you're hooked up
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:09.840]   to, that is your head end, gets congested and they blame you.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.560]   It's your fault.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.400]   And either you'll get throttled for at least 15 minutes or until your average bandwidth
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.120]   utilization drops below 50% for 15 minutes.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.960]   So now this is by throttling, they take you from, I can't remember what the acronyms are,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.120]   but like best effort preferred down to best effort or something like that, right?
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.600]   There are two ways you could be.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.640]   You could be priority best effort.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640]   That's the fault.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   That's it.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.400]   And then the lower priority is best effort.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:47.560]   But you know, this just sounds like what the FCC would allow, reasonable network management.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.040]   And there's the hole.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.720]   They're not looking at particular protocols.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.640]   They're not saying, oh, he's using Skype or BitTorrent.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.040]   They're just saying he's a bandwidth hog.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.800]   So you don't think this is a problem?
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Frank, what do you think?
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   You're talking to me?
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.920]   I certainly, yes, I certainly think it's a problem.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.040]   This phrase of reasonable management and then watching what you're doing, if you're going
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.840]   to give me access to the internet, let me do what I want to do and let me go to those
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.360]   websites and let me use it the way I want.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.200]   Now, I have no quarrel.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.120]   In fact, I buy a tiered service.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.080]   I have no issues with tiered services.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   Yeah, I don't mind paying more if I want more.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   Yeah, and that's fine with me.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.880]   And that I think should qualify as reasonable network management opportunities for that.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:43.400]   For the ISPs and revenue opportunity slowing me down in the middle of what I'm doing presumably
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.280]   within the constraints of that tier because that's the pipe you've let me lease for the
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.840]   moment.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   Leave me alone.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.000]   Yeah, I'm with you on that because I bought whatever I bought.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.840]   I bought 15 megabits down and one megabit up.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.200]   I should get that.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.120]   I should be able to use that full time, right?
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   That's what I bought.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.680]   What I think that's the key here, right, is that they tell you in advance, all right,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.320]   you're getting 16 megabits per second, but you only get to use 70% of that.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.840]   So it shouldn't be called 16 megabits per second, right?
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.920]   And they should tell you upfront.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.680]   And if you go over 70% for 15 minutes, you're going to get throttled.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   You may not notice.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   You may.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.360]   It depends on what you're doing, but that should be upfront.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   And these things aren't upfront.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.280]   They're in FCC filings, but they're not in your user agreement.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.560]   They don't say 16 megabits per second actually means 10, 12 megabits per second all the time.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.600]   And it's only 16 as long as you're not doing it for more than 15 minutes.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   So here's my question.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.800]   That now leads to the net neutrality.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.040]   Which is worse, having the government regulate the internet or letting these guys decide what
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   to do.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   And they're both bad, right?
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.360]   And this is the battle that the EFF is having even at the board level is, well gosh, we don't
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:02.120]   really want to say, well, come on, help us FCC because boy, that's a slippery slope.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   And yet at the same time, who trusts the phone companies to do or the internet service providers
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.680]   to do this right?
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.320]   So I'm just curious what you guys think.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.680]   What is the solution to this?
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   Anybody?
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   Bueller?
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.680]   Competition.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:21.240]   I think the solution is to get in there and encourage more choices because all of the
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.080]   arguments about not regulating say, well, if you don't like the ISP, you have, you move
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.080]   to another.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.440]   The problem is most people in the United States don't have another or at least not another
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.920]   five place to go.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.720]   That's exactly the problem, isn't it?
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:39.120]   I totally agree with Tom though that they should certainly be more upfront about it.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.280]   They should offer like a little utility.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.000]   You can download that tells you this is how much you've used and this is when we're going
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.320]   to cut you off.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.360]   If that's going to be their policy, they should certainly be upfront about it so people can
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.640]   decide, well, I don't really like this policy.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.360]   I'm going to hop to a different carrier.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.720]   Yeah, but then I think that's exactly it though, isn't it?
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.280]   They want to make sure that it's as obfuscated as possible.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:09.200]   They want to be able to offer unlimited internet but sort of restrain, keep the right to shut
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.000]   you down when they're not too happy about it.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.080]   I mean, over here we've had massive problems with companies advertising unlimited internet
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.600]   where in school print is unlimited is less than five gigabytes and like, well, how can
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.400]   you possibly say it's unlimited?
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400]   Just say five gigabytes.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.120]   Yeah, well, I just happened to me.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.920]   I just bought the droid and it says, you know, over 30 bucks unlimited internet.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.000]   Yeah, as long as you go over five gigabytes.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   How can they call it?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.840]   How do they even get away with calling it unlimited?
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   I have no idea.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.400]   And as long as you don't tell them.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   So, yeah, no care.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   Yeah, I'll look at the answer.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.360]   Don't use it and it's unlimited.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.040]   Don't use exchange.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.840]   It was that, well, legally over here anyway, because there was a big stink about this.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:56.520]   You can call it if unlimited if for 90% of the users they won't notice any caps.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:04.800]   So if 90% of the user base won't encounter any caps, you can call it unlimited.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.360]   Who the heck that's a bill Clinton type of waffle.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.440]   Who the hell wrote that regulation?
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.360]   No kidding with syrup.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.160]   I did not go over five gigabytes with that data.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.800]   I think you just fell off your couch there.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:29.040]   I wonder if this has any precedent in buffet law and stay with stay with you.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   Yeah, all you can eat.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.360]   All you can eat buffet has been in court before for saying we can call it all you can eat
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.760]   as long as most people will be able to eat all you can eat.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.640]   But we can stop people if they're abusing and eating too much.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.960]   It's the potato salad exemption.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   Of course Tom.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.480]   It might be.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.240]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.440]   There's case law.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.680]   I used to eat at Perry boy smorgi.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.480]   You don't know how long that stuff has been sitting there though.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   That's the problem.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.120]   I can't remember the name of the one in Illinois that I grew up going to.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.680]   But that stuff was there all day under that hot thing.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.080]   You don't want to eat there after two o'clock.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Well, so you've been a huge fan of private companies and Tom's idea that competition will
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.040]   rule or may well be the solution.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.400]   I mean, yeah, who wants the FCC to regulate the internet?
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.760]   That's a terrible at the same time.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:31.000]   I'm imagining the Yulahs, the user agreements that will come with these tiers of service.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.600]   And you know, I know they'll hide the salami somewhere.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.440]   Speaking of hiding the salami, they're telling me it was the old country buffet, Tom.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   Is that does that ring a bell?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.520]   I know the old country buffet, but that was the one that I went to.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   There was a different one.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.000]   They came with a D I think or something anyway.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Golden Scott.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.240]   Who might know?
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   I don't know.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   Golden coral?
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   Oh, can corral?
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   Corral.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   Corral.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.720]   These are all good buffet places though.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.960]   I mean, I know we're supposed to be talking about net neutrality, but a good buffet recommendation
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.280]   is very valuable.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.320]   And it does metaphorically relate to net neutrality.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   Do you want the FCC coming in and telling you how much the data salad you can take?
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   Exactly.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Exactly.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.840]   There's a, this is now talking about a rat hole.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.080]   There's a Chinese restaurant in town, which was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.640]   And I have a feeling they're not doing very well because they recently put out a poster
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:26.240]   that said we also have Mexican, Chinese, French, Italian.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.080]   You want, we got it.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   Ponderosa.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.080]   Ponderosa.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.760]   Thank you, Jay Toshiba.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   That was the one.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.480]   And then Dr. Mario says Ponderosa is terrible.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.320]   Yes, it is.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.000]   But do they hide the salami?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.800]   So are we all in agreement that the, I mean, last week, I really went on a, on a, on a
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:53.440]   a podium in there and said, savetheinternet.com, go there, let your Congress member know what
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.080]   the, what, what, because these laws that John McCain was sponsoring and then, and then
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.360]   one in the house that said, you know, there shall be no regulation on the internet really
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   worried me.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.440]   But at the same time, maybe that is the right answer.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.880]   But how do you encourage competition?
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.760]   I mean, right now, even though there is no law requiring it, every cable company in the,
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   in the, in the US has a monopoly.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.600]   There's one and only one.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.520]   And there's usually only one telco.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.280]   So that means basically in most regions, there's two companies competing for your internet
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   dollar.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.520]   So I mean, how does it work compared to utilities like water?
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.800]   Like who guarantees that if you pay your water bill, you get water.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   It's the same thing.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:42.560]   It's a municipal monopoly, basically the, the, the local municipalities in effect, it's
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.040]   not by law, but in effect, pick an incumbent, a cable company, they pick an incumbent water
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.080]   company and that's, that's the water.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.200]   That's the, if it's not publicly run, that's the water.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   It's certainly true of cable.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.640]   Now the phone company, I don't know that, that goes back to AT&T's breakup.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.720]   I mean, that, that was when, that was when the courts decided that AT&T should be divided
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.480]   into regional bells, which they've slowly recompiled.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.360]   I mean, we used to be Pacific Bell, then we were Southwest Bell when they united with
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   Southwestern Bell.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.600]   Then 18, and now, and now, yeah, and now it's AT&T here in California.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   So.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:31.640]   I mean, I, I, I've been a big attacker of the crazy attacks on the FCC policy here.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.720]   And I, because I don't like it when people use FUD to defend their point.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.680]   And there's been a lot of ridiculous things said about what the FCC wants to do and the
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.840]   effects that it'll have, it'll ruin poor people.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.240]   It'll allow a fairness doctrine to go to a place.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.240]   None of that is true.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.640]   But at the same time, I'm very concerned about the language that the FCC will use and what
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   the FCC is.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.400]   Do you really want to get a right organization to do this?
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   Do you really want to give them the power to say what's okay on the internet?
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:06.000]   If it's, if it's kept very strictly to the ability to say, look, you can't as Comcast
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.800]   degrade all the videos that come across your internet connection, except for Comcast Sports
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   Network E and G4, because you own those, then yes, I'm for that.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.200]   I think, I think that should be a policy, maybe a law.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.040]   I think there should be some way of guaranteeing that.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.160]   But what's the best way to go about that is, is what's being debated.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.600]   I'm not sure I know the answer.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:35.880]   I mean, at this point, having the FCC do a very limited policy seems to be the best compromise.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880]   It's very difficult.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.600]   I could see the EFF's difficulty here.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:45.400]   It's really too, you know, a collision of two different, of two strongly held beliefs.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.480]   But I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, it's a Hobson's choice as well, isn't it?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.000]   It is a Hobson's choice.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.160]   Because you don't really feel like there's a great outcome either way.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   Right.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.920]   There's not, I think the ideal solution would be to have increased competition, but the
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.600]   barrier to entry is just so massively high, how's the company going to lay all of the
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.920]   pipes and all the wires?
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.880]   I think wireless might be the solution.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.840]   It could be the principle for slow.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.200]   Leo, maybe it shouldn't be the FCC.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   Who should it be?
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   Carbers?
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:20.600]   Well, who runs, let's try Department of Commerce, which right now oversees icon, right?
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   Right.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.080]   So, is there a possible way, if Department of Commerce has already got there, is already
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.760]   working with the internet, is already involved with the internet, isn't that a way to have
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   a government agency?
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:41.360]   I know we're on that issue again, but a government agency try to handle neutrality rather than
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.760]   the FCC, which can begin talking about, you know, decency and what you can and cannot
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   do.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.440]   But Department of Commerce might be, might be a thought.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   They're already there with icon.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   Do you see?
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.480]   And I say that if I think most people sort of, or sort of on the panel seem to be agreeing
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.040]   that if in an ideal world you could have more competition, that would lead to a degree of
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   self-regulation.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:09.680]   But actually, I think wireless is one of the great hopes for this because, you know, you
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.960]   have to imagine that 3G speeds are fine for 90% of the people, or, you know, okay, maybe
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:21.320]   it's a bit strong, maybe for 60% of the people around who just want email and internet and
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.920]   really standard kind of stuff.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:30.720]   And actually, the provision of sort of YMAX and 4G services in the next 5 years could massively
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.680]   change the way that we think about internet connections and their utility because if we
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:42.120]   get to a stage where the cable is not necessary, then that suddenly opens up a whole ream of
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.640]   competition options.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.120]   I've got two issues with that because I've been in that same place where I thought Fort
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.000]   YMAX is going to save us or LTE or one of those.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.680]   But the things that hold me up are it always seems like wireless doesn't perform as well
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   as wired.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.080]   You know, no matter what protocol you're talking about, there's always something that's not
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.480]   quite there, the service is a little irregular or whatever.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   Maybe that will get worked out because every wireless protocol gets better than the last.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.800]   But the other side of it is, will we end up with the same issue with wireless where,
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:21.200]   okay, you have slow DSL, fast cable or fiber and a wireless provider.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.160]   I mean, is it going to give us enough competition, I guess, is what I'm asking.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.040]   Majority of people are wireless now anyway.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.280]   I haven't hooked up my computer to an ethernet cable in forever, so I'm going over Wi-Fi
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.600]   at the very least.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.200]   And 3G, you'd be surprised how fast it is when the-
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.960]   Wait, you see 4G, the new 4G.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.520]   Oh, they're rolling it out next year.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.960]   Yeah, it's doing it in a few cities, right?
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.360]   Verizon is rolling it out next year in a limited rollout.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.680]   And that's going to be fast as fast as you're cable.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.760]   Maybe that's the solution.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.800]   Yeah, and you're right.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.400]   For most people, Wi-Fi is going to be fine.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.960]   I mean, I end up going with wired for reliability when I'm uploading video or streaming video.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.520]   Well, we ask people who are skyping with us to go wired.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.240]   All you guys are wired because Wi-Fi drops every once in a while.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.120]   So for some things like watching video, you know, are you on Wi-Fi?
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.720]   I can tell by the way, you drop it out all the time.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.440]   That's what I can tell.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.040]   You're killing me.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.120]   You're killing me.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:23.440]   So, Meckman, I'm sorry you got booted for pasting the response from your member of Congress to writing.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.000]   I asked him.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.960]   He wrote to them about the net neutrality issue.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:36.520]   And his Congress member, who was named L-L-C-11, I think.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:42.160]   Yeah, Senator Carl Levin wrote, "Thank you for contacting me regarding internet regulation and
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.880]   network neutrality.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.840]   I appreciate hearing your views on this matter.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.360]   The internet has become an indispensable tool that has spurred innovation, provided virtually
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.920]   unlimited access to information and commerce, and increased communication through websites,
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.360]   e-man and blogs.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.000]   It has become increasingly difficult to imagine life without the internet as we know it,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.080]   a system that is open and unrestricted.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:00.720]   That's good.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.480]   Like that so far, Carl.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.760]   But let me read on.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.160]   He says earlier, this legal legislation was introduced to maintain the longstanding
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.040]   regulations that pre-detect against discriminatory network practices.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.200]   Ed Markey introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.240]   Markey's smart.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.760]   This bill would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish a national broadband
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:32.720]   internet policy, including parental control features, aspects of access, consumer choice
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.680]   competition, content discriminatory.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   Bill would direct the FCC.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.880]   Now, this is one of the issues is the FCC, some say.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.840]   It does not even have standing to do these regulations.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:50.960]   So this bill would direct the FCC to protect the internet, to establish net neutrality
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.760]   rules to codify and supplement existing internet openness principles while maintaining the
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.200]   ability of ISPs to engage in reasonable network management.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   Oh, man.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.720]   You see in the sausage being made now, kids.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.400]   Among other things, the proposed draft rules were prohibited internet access providers from
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:12.160]   preventing its users from sending receiving a lawful content over the internet.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.120]   Of course, who decides what there's lawful, right?
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.720]   Prohibit internet access providers from preventing users from connecting lawful devices and would
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:27.560]   require ISPs to treat lawful content applications and services in a non-discriminatory manner.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   What do you think?
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   I have to say--
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.560]   Senator Stephen S. Lives.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   Markey's smart, though.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.960]   Markey's one of the few guys who I think really gets the internet.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:42.240]   But boy, I tell you, every time you see-- I hear this idea of regulation, I'm getting
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   nervous.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   By the way, can I--
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.240]   Go ahead.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.400]   These are the four principles that the FCC is using now proposing making a permanent
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.080]   policy.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.640]   Entitlement to access the lawful internet content of your choice.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.160]   Entitlement to run applications and use services of your choice subject to the needs of law
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:04.120]   enforcement, entitlement to connect your choice of legal devices that do not harm the network,
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.680]   and entitlement to competition among network providers, application and service providers,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   and content providers--
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.680]   I can get behind that.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.680]   --that.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.520]   Those seem fairly uncontroversial as written.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.040]   I think everybody's freaked out about, well, what do they do next after that?
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.080]   It's the camel's nose in the tent.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   Not that camel.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:27.200]   I don't think the FCC has nowhere else-- anywhere else to go from there.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:32.120]   I mean, they're not like this all-seeing government organization that can do everything.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:39.200]   When they probed into Apple not approving Google Voice on the iPhone, they-- I don't
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.840]   really think they had the authority to do anything.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   They were just asking.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   They were just asking.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.840]   I'm just curious.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   I'm just asking.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.840]   Here's an interesting article.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:51.880]   Somebody in the chat room has sent me, "Want 50 megabit internet in your town?
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:56.720]   Threaten to roll out your own."
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.480]   This was up in Minnesota, right?
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:05.760]   Monicella, Minnesota, TDS, which is a regional telco, is offering 50 megabit service over
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   fiber optic cable.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:17.440]   They don't have files, but they can get this service from $50 a month for 50 megabits.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.800]   I don't know if they're a regional bell or if they're some sort of subsidiary.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   I'm not sure what they're--
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.520]   Oh, a whole telco or something.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.840]   The idea was they weren't offering anything good.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.240]   The city went and said, "We're going to build our own fiber network."
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:37.960]   And the telco got upset, sued them, said, "The government should not be allowed to build
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.120]   a telco network."
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.760]   Because that's anti-competitive.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.960]   They went to court, dragged them through court long enough that they could get their actual
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.240]   fiber network up and running.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.880]   The town won the court case, but by the time they got out of court--
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.120]   It was too late.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.400]   The telco had their own product out there.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.640]   So the city probably will just say, "Okay, we'll never mind."
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   Right?
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   Right?
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.480]   At this point, they got the effect of what they wanted, which was 50 megabit per second
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.480]   fiber.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   I see.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   Well, that's fascinating.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   They went in the Minnesota Supreme Court.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:14.720]   Interestingly, I've been informed by a chap called Ross on my Twitter feed that it's not
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   a Hobson's choice.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.720]   It's a Morton's fork.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:25.360]   Hobson's choice is two unpleasant decisions, which lead to two equally bad.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.680]   But it's different outcomes.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:31.280]   Whereas Morton's fork is a choice between two unpleasant alternatives that lead to the
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:37.600]   same unpleasant conclusion, which is the exact opposite of the Beridin's ass, apparently.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.040]   Who's ass?
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:46.840]   So Beridin's ass, which is the paradox, which is that if you put an ass between two equally
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.280]   sized bales of hay, it will starve to death because it can't make a rational decision
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.880]   to do either.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.880]   Fascinate.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   Fascinate.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.880]   Hence, the term acts.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.080]   Who makes this crap up?
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   It's obviously a Brit.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.080]   Right?
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.920]   I mean, who else?
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:06.040]   When Morton's fork, the expression originates from a policy of tax collection devised by
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.760]   John Morton, Lord Chancellor England in 1487.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   There you go.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   Under him.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   Oh, it wasn't Morton's fisherman then.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   Okay.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   The Morton's of Gloucester.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   Let's take a break and just collect our thoughts about Beridin's ass, Morton's fork, and Hobson's
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.760]   choice.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   What is it?
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   Beridin?
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   Beridin's ass.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.760]   How do you spell it?
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   B-U-R-R-O?
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   No, B-U-R-I-D-A-N.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   Do we have an episode title?
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.760]   Beridin's ass, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   I think picking the episode title is a Beridin's ass.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.160]   It's going to get harder and harder is what it's going to get.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.160]   All right.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.160]   Let's take a break.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.320]   We're going to talk about audible.com.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:51.200]   Come back with more of our great panel, Mr. Will Harris from the UK, providing us with
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.280]   a little education here.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.480]   Tom Merritt of Buzz Out Loud at CNET.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   Always glad to have Tom on.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.600]   He'll be on again a little bit with Roger Chang for East Meets West.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.640]   Frank Barnico of MarketWatchFame and Barnico.com.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.160]   And in studio with me, Mark Millian, who is from the LA Times, The World's Youngest
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   Reporter.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.920]   You are literally a cub reporter.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.920]   You're like Jimmy Olsen.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:21.040]   Yeah, it's actually not as bad though as the connotation carries with that.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.520]   No, I think it's good.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.720]   I think the LA Times said, "If you're going to cover social media and technology, you
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.680]   better get somebody under 30 to do it."
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   Right.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.280]   Makes perfect sense to me.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.480]   The show brought to you by our good friends at audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:41.440]   We were talking about the copper bracelet that's still available to Twit listeners for $9.95,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.480]   but I'm going to tell you how you can get any book free.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:48.600]   But the copper bracelet deal, by the way, if you're a member or not, doesn't matter.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.480]   Here's for folks who are not yet members of Audible.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:56.040]   I don't know how you could possibly have managed not to become a member of audible.com.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.720]   But you've got to join audible.com.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.720]   It's the place to go to get your audio books.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:08.400]   If you commute, if you go to the gym, if you spend any time in the day when you just can't
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:14.920]   hold a book because you're busy, your arms, your hands are busy, Audible is such a wonderful
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   solution.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.240]   I'll tell you, for years Audible saved me.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.720]   It allowed me to listen to great literature.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.160]   I've read hundreds of books on Audible when I had the commute.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:32.120]   I still do because Audible is the most, to me, wonderful kind of entertainment.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.400]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, right now you can sign up for the platinum account.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.600]   That's two books a month.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.040]   Your first two books are free.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:44.000]   And even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep those books.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Cancel it anytime.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.140]   The books are yours to keep for your life.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.320]   Have you been seeing the promos for this movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats?
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.320]   I cannot wait to see this.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.320]   I don't know.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   It might be a terrible movie.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.320]   I don't know.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.040]   It just looks hysterical.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.800]   It's based on a novel by John Ronson.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.040]   A Brit, I believe.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.320]   It's Britain's funniest and most insightful satirist reveals extraordinary military secrets
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.520]   at the core of Bush's War on Terror.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.560]   Have you ever read this?
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.920]   Will Harris?
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   I haven't.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   Do you know who John Ronson is?
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:15.920]   Do you know who John Ronson is?
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   Will John Ronson?
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.420]   I'm not educated enough to know this stuff.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.900]   Let me play a little bit of this here.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.500]   Ooh, it's got music.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:27.500]   This must be the beginning.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:36.700]   Okay, well, we'll have to skip that.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.700]   They've obviously...
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.900]   It doesn't sound very British.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:41.180]   They linked the wrong sound file.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:43.700]   Do I need to put my glow stick away now?
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.700]   I think so.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.820]   It's like being an array, wasn't it?
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:52.280]   In 1979, a secret unit was established by the most gifted minds within the US Army, defying
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.180]   all known accepted military practice.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:59.040]   And indeed, the law of physics, they believe that a soldier...
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.920]   This is true, by the way.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.320]   This is not fiction.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.000]   I mean, the book is funny, but it's true.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.560]   They believed a soldier could adopt the cloak of invisibility, pass cleanly through walls,
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:19.360]   and perhaps most chillingly, kill goats just by staring at them.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.960]   This is not a joke.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.640]   The man who's stare at goats, John Ronson, but this is just one of many, many books you
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.840]   can get at audible.com.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   That's the thing about Audible.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.680]   You know, before I see a movie, I always listen to the book because it's like a movie
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.040]   in your head.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.480]   Get it, get two books free.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:40.760]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and yes, the copper bracelet is still a great deal at Audible
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.520]   for $9.95.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:47.400]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   Please give them a try.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.840]   And by the way, it works great with the Ford Sync.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.840]   It's so cool.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:58.120]   I have the books on my iPhone, and I've linked the iPhone up with the Ford Sync.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.640]   And so by Bluetooth, so when I get in the car, it starts the book.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.040]   When I get out of the car, it stops the book.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.960]   The next time I get in the car, it picks it up where it left off.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.040]   It's like spooky.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.160]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:16.840]   Thank you for their support of this week in tech.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.000]   So Skype, we were talking about Skype earlier.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.480]   Skype, boy, this has been a crazy story.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:27.720]   eBay bought Skype for $3 billion, but oops, we left out one little piece.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.760]   You only buy the user and it bought the user interface and the program and the name.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:37.840]   In fact, the intellectual property, the way Skype works, you needn't buy that.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   You didn't get that.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.280]   The Nicholas Sensstrom and Johnus Frees must be the smartest guys in the world, or eBay
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.360]   must have been the dumbest company in the world, because they kept it.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   Well eBay had the license to it for a while, but then they failed to renew it or something?
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   That's even dumber.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.680]   But you want to buy it.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:58.040]   If you're paying a few billion for something, you want to actually get like runs it, right?
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.480]   Like me buying the Mustang, and I didn't get the engine.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.720]   It's like you paid to license the engine and forgot to renew it.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   Oh, I forgot to license, renew the light.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.480]   Oh, we're going to take the engine now.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   You can keep the car.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   It's red.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.560]   You're sure there was a lawyer in the room.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.400]   Well eBay didn't have a lawyer apparently.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:23.800]   Anyway, Zenstrom and Frees sold, or I'm sorry, Skype was sold by eBay, 65% of it to an investment
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.280]   firm.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.840]   And then their little lawsuit started flying.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:34.160]   Actually, it was a consortium of investors and one of the consortium, one of the groups
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.020]   had inside information for people on the eBay board and the Skype board and the Skype
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.020]   chairman.
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:41.180]   You can see what I'm getting confused.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.760]   A lot of the problem was that the big, one of the big investors in the consortium was
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   index ventures.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   Right.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:55.000]   And index had just appointed a new venture capitalist who was the chap that ran juiced
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.360]   for them in Europe.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.360]   Right.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.660]   And who, the juiced guy who the skylight founders had accused of massively defrauding
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.160]   juiced basically.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.960]   And then he goes on and says, I'm going to buy a skylight.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:14.500]   So after being sacked from juiced by these two guys, he then goes and joins the board
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.420]   of index ventures and starts making part of this bid for Skype.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:27.060]   So as part of this deal, he's had to, I got off.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.540]   So now, okay, the lawsuits are flying on Friday.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:36.220]   I'm going to have to get you to explain this, Will, because I don't, it's beyond my, you
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.220]   were, weren't you studying to be a solicitor?
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.380]   No, I technically could do this stuff if I felt like I was there.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.380]   You actually passed.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.700]   We allegedly.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.460]   So this guy could be, could be in court, but instead he's here.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.020]   Sorry.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.180]   So the settlement, according to this gives Skype ownership of critical software that
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:02.780]   had been licensed from Zendstereman Freese.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.580]   So, and it effectively ends their litigation.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:12.740]   Those investors pulled out, Zendstereman Freese get 14% stake in Skype and they agreed
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.020]   to make a significant capital investment in it.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.060]   Some of that billion that eBay gave them, I guess gets, gets folded back in.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.260]   So is Skype safe now?
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260]   Is everything okay?
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.100]   There was also even a rumor that they were going to open source it, but then it turns
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:29.060]   out they're only open sourcing the stuff, you know, the red car, they're keeping the
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.620]   engine close source.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.780]   So, yeah, it sounds like it's safe.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.740]   It sounds like the new company will have the intellectual property.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.900]   It needs to operate Skype and I hopefully think that they license it better than eBay
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.900]   did and there'll be a company that will be able to pursue Skype for itself rather than
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.580]   as some sort of weird add in for auctions.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.300]   Crazy man.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:59.580]   So tell me then what about the open source thing, Will?
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.580]   Is that you're saying that?
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.220]   I don't understand it.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:11.980]   I think the issue is that the guys that wrote Skype, they did the Zendstereman Freese, they
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.740]   basically created one core bit of technology which was this peer to peer.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.620]   That we're using right now that works really well.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.620]   That's what we're using right now.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.100]   And they used that to power different things.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.500]   So they had Kazar first, they used it for that.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.580]   And they used it for Skype.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.540]   And then they used it for juice.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.540]   They used it for juice.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.540]   That's right.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.620]   And they're using it for their new music service.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.340]   So they basically come up with one kind of technology and they've used it to power four
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.380]   different startups worth collectively billions of dollars.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.380]   These guys are smart.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   It's genius, isn't it?
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.380]   Absolutely genius.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   Brilliant.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.620]   And now they get that.
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.020]   So, and then they sell for three billion.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.700]   Presumably they got to keep a lot of that.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.100]   I'm sure they were investors but I'm sure they got a billion out of it or something.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:55.060]   And now they get to buy back in and I mean they got to be living out of the island.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.300]   So they sell it for three billion.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.820]   They pocket a good chunk of it.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.740]   It gets sold back in the exchange.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.300]   They did this clever deal where they didn't sell technology.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.660]   But now they get 14% back again.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.900]   So they're now another few hundred million in.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.460]   All right.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.060]   Does all of us reflect badly at all on Nate Whitman?
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.060]   Yes.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.700]   She's trying to run for a governor here and she was a plus.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.860]   She was a part of this whole deal.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.060]   She made the deal.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.660]   She looks like a complete nincompoop, doesn't she?
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.660]   I mean I don't know how much she had to do with the terms.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:30.700]   But anybody, whoever was oversaw that purchase obviously was not paying close attention.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.420]   She was seeing you at the time, right?
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.660]   She definitely put her pen to the paper.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:40.140]   So Jerry Brown and whoever she ends up running against has a little bit of ammunition.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.780]   That would be a super entertaining thing.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.100]   How can he explain it though?
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.100]   You know what is he going to say?
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.140]   Well let me explain what happened under Meg Whitman's.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.140]   Can you see the hit ad?
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.780]   Meg Whitman bought Skype but left out the engine.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.460]   Is she competent to rule California?
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:02.700]   She might buy Arizona but forget to license Phoenix.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.340]   Do we really want Meg Whitman in the White House?
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.820]   No I'm sorry.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:07.820]   Confusing.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.060]   All right now you really want to have your mind blown.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.340]   This is in the New York Times so it's got to be true.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.900]   You know the Large Hadron Collider that remember this is the thing.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.500]   Oh you know where I'm going with this don't you?
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.860]   So this thing is they're building it outside Geneva.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:34.980]   It's basically a ginormous underground racetrack for subatomic particles.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.500]   And they're really investigating the origins of the universe, the Big Bang and they're
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:43.500]   looking for a very elusive particle that nobody's ever observed but has been hypothesized to
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.300]   exist called the Higgs Boson.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.420]   And they're hoping they could produce a Higgs Boson with a super collider.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.500]   But man it's been tough.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.780]   I mean they were going to start last year and they had power problems and something just
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.460]   recently they had to shut the whole thing down.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:07.100]   It was warming up and a bird dropped a baguette into it.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.500]   I love this.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:09.940]   A bird dropped.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.580]   I mean come on.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.580]   This thing must be very fragile.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.580]   I thought it was underground.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.580]   How could a bird?
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:20.580]   Yeah well for what I read it was not running at the time but a bird dropped a baguette on
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.340]   some vent or something and if it had been running it would have overheated and they
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.540]   would have had to shut it down.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.380]   This is the equivalent of Luke Skywalker dropping a bomb in the Death Star right in
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.620]   the vent.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.780]   How do you design something that a baguette can take out?
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.340]   The same guy.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.020]   See in the future the same guy is going to design the Death Star.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.980]   Well okay now but this is where it starts to get weird.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.980]   The bird turned off its targeting system.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:44.980]   Yeah exactly.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.980]   He just went in.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.740]   He used the force.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.380]   I'm going in.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:55.180]   So two very very well known physicists one of whom basically is credited with string
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.260]   theory.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:02.540]   Holger, Beck Nielsen of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and Masal, Ni-No-Mia of the
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:08.820]   Yokawa Institute for Theoretical Physics in Kyoto have written a paper called for instance
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.900]   there actually is a series of papers one of them was called Test of Effect from Future
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:19.340]   in Large Hadron Collider a Proposal or Search for Future Influence from LHC.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.920]   Now you do the Sword and Laser podcast Tom.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.380]   This is worthy of the finest science fiction.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:33.020]   They think the reason all of these things have been happening to the LHC is because the
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:40.020]   Higgs boson does not want to be discovered.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.020]   Brilliant isn't it?
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.580]   Because the only way to disprove it is to discover the Higgs boson.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.580]   Which you can't.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   Might not happen.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:51.580]   Wouldn't it be interesting if like they know I mean what of course if they get this thing
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.780]   online tomorrow then this paper is stupid or is it?
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:01.780]   If well not just get it online but have the collision and have the data and process it
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.100]   and discover evidence of the Higgs boson all that stuff has to happen.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.500]   But I mean legitimately it's a theory right?
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.300]   It's something that they can defend.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.900]   They've got a peer reviewed article coming out about it so who's to say they're wrong.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.180]   I mean there's weirder stuff in quantum mechanics.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.940]   If you read any of the Richard Feynman stuff in quantum electrodynamics you balance the
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.900]   equations by having electrons go back in time.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:29.460]   So maybe the Higgs boson just doesn't want to be found.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.780]   And if you can't find it does that prove that it exists?
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.020]   And it may be.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:41.180]   In an email Dr. Nielsen says it must be our prediction that all Higgs producing machines
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.780]   shall have bad luck.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.780]   I can't say it has an adverse lot.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:53.020]   He goes on in an unpublished essay he goes on to say one could almost say we have a model
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:08:01.140]   for God and that God rather hates Higgs particles and attempts to avoid them.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.460]   Have these guys got off the deep end or is this brilliant physics?
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.460]   Both sounds like job security.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:12.860]   When you come to that conclusion you should probably stop.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:17.100]   These guys will never be out of a job.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.100]   I just like it.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.740]   They have proposed a test.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:27.060]   They want CERN which is the other big physics operation.
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:31.500]   I mean CERN is doing its own particle physics.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.660]   They want CERN to engage in a game of chance a card drawing exercise using perhaps a random
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:45.020]   number generator in order to discern bad luck from the future.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:50.220]   If the outcome is sufficiently unlikely, say drawing one spade in a deck with 100 million
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:55.020]   hearts, the machine would either not run at all or only at low energies unlikely to
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.380]   find the Higgs.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.980]   This is nuts.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.140]   How does the card game work again?
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.140]   I don't know.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.900]   It's an episode of scam school I think.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:11.700]   I think the idea is that they try to do something that would have a certain statistical probability
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:18.820]   and if something very improbable almost infinitely improbable happens then we know the future
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.340]   is fiddling with the present.
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:28.740]   When you have to tie the card drawing into the process of finding the Higgs party, somehow,
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.980]   the cat is both dead and alive.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.500]   The infinite improbability drives.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.500]   Exactly.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:40.380]   But the New York Times is saying these guys are respectable.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:45.900]   They're not being laughed out of the academy for this.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:50.220]   Einstein once wrote for all those of us who believe in physics, the separation between
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.020]   past, present and future is merely an illusion.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:10:00.260]   Yeah, I mean, if they got the math to back it up, I don't have the shops to find out.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.660]   But you can prove crazy stuff like this with good kung fu.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.340]   It's craziness.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.340]   Craziness.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.900]   I love it though.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.100]   And the Times ends with the story from Kurt Vonnegut, "Sirens of Titan."
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.340]   Have you read that at Soren laser?
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.340]   That would be a good one to read.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.340]   Yeah, we haven't read that one yet.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:24.140]   The theory being that the entire all of human history is really just to help an alien get
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:29.580]   a small piece of metal the size of a beer can opener to his spaceship on Saturn's moon
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.260]   so he can go home.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.660]   It all leads to it's like the mice.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.820]   It's like 42.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   It's like Douglas Adams.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:40.420]   It makes me feel like that scene in the Hitchhiker's Guide to Reach.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.260]   You have been rescued from certain death and probability level of two to the power of
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:48.340]   260,199 to one against and falling.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.180]   Douglas Adams was right.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.620]   Zaw.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620]   Very funny stuff.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.380]   Well, predicted the PDA.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.020]   I mean, that's true.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.020]   Did you see the Beatles?
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:06.820]   I was all excited.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.500]   It is a week of freaky stories.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.580]   This is a really freaky story.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.420]   I mean, come on.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.180]   These guys believe me.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.220]   Judge John Walter, the US District Court for the Central District of California issues
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:22.140]   a temporary restraining order against a company called Blue Beat Capital Records, which owns
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:29.420]   the rights to the Beatles recordings, said these guys can't release this.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.740]   The guys claimed, well, we've remixed it.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:38.380]   It's not really the Beatles' music that we're releasing on here.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.900]   It is a psychoacoustic simulation.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.580]   There's no Higgs bosons involved in this one.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.500]   That's the craziest defense ever.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.500]   It's...
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:55.340]   You know, this guy Hank Risen at Blue Beat, he's been talking like this weirdly since
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.340]   2007.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:01.140]   He wrote a piece back on Huffington Post that is almost authentic technological gibberish
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:05.260]   to quote Mel Brooks.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.780]   He goes on...
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.380]   At that point, just two years ago, he was concerned that streaming was the source of
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:20.940]   all piracy and says he had demanded some kind of possible streaming copyright protection,
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.340]   which Microsoft broke.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:28.260]   And so when he received a letter from the RIA, it wasn't his fault, it was Microsoft.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.260]   He's way out there.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.260]   There's one thought.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.900]   One school have thought that this is all publicity sound for whatever he's going to
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.900]   do next.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.060]   I think he's going to invent cold fusion, I believe, is his next project.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:43.660]   Maybe the conspiracy theory that he was going to win in court with this defense and then
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:48.340]   be the only person who could sell a DRM that could stop psychoacoustical simulation from
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.340]   happening.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.540]   Now, that's the money in there.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.340]   There's gotta be some money in that.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:53.340]   All right, I want to...
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.740]   Oh boy, there's so much weird stuff.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:00.020]   The woman who's going to broadcast her child's birth live on the internet.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.420]   23-year-old Minnesota teacher.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.580]   She's been blogging about her pregnancy on the social network, MomsLikeMe.com.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.300]   Will live broadcast the birth of her child online on MomsLikeMe.com.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.500]   Do not want.
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.500]   Do not want.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.500]   Do not want.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.500]   Please.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.500]   Is this old?
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   Didn't somebody do this?
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.980]   Like when we were on the screensavers in 1999, wasn't a big deal.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   It feels like that.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:23.980]   But maybe...
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:24.980]   I don't know.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.980]   You know, you're pretty much...
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   Pretty much...
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.980]   You can hold.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.540]   You can watch every stage of the life cycle on the internet now.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.540]   There's nothing that's not...
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.900]   There's nothing private.
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.300]   Are you guys excited about Call of Duty?
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.300]   What is it?
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.300]   Five?
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.300]   Modern Warfare 2?
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.300]   Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare 2.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.460]   Is it four or five?
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.060]   Well, technically it's...
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.060]   It's four part two.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.060]   It's four part two.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.060]   It's four part two.
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.180]   Yeah, because Call of Duty 4 was Modern Warfare 1.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.180]   So this would be four part two.
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.180]   It's amazing.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.180]   I saw it in Miami.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.820]   It doesn't come out until Tuesday, right?
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:56.820]   Tuesday, yeah.
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:02.180]   But my local game store had it running yesterday when I went in and I had a bit of a game on
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.300]   it and it was absolutely immense.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.300]   They're using the same numbering scheme Windows 7 is using.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.300]   It's like...
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.300]   Make up a number.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.300]   Make up a number.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.300]   Call of Duty XP.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.260]   So it really seemed like they pushed the graphics to just like a new level.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:22.100]   People are very excited.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.260]   But it does have a terrible twist in the tail.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.340]   Oh, it does?
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:32.340]   Which not many people have picked up on yet, but which is going to become a massive, massive
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.340]   news item next week.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.100]   Oh, we have a scoop, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.100]   Right here.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.100]   You're hearing it here first from Will Harris.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.100]   What is that, Will?
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.140]   Well, I don't want to spoil it for anybody, so I won't.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.300]   But in very broad terms, the game is rated 18 and it's the first Call of Duty game that's
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.300]   been rated 18.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:53.180]   It's rated 18 for one particular scene in the game which appears relatively early on.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.340]   Is this in the mall?
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.340]   Bown-trick-a-bown-wound.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   Is that really?
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   Is it that?
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.340]   I haven't heard about this.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:08.380]   Particularly in the light of what happened last week in the US, in the military base
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.380]   shooting.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.820]   Oh, that's going to be very controversial.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   That's going to be very controversial if they do.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.300]   That's bad timing.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.300]   Very bad.
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.300]   Bad timing.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.540]   And it's one of those things where you just think like after all the work that people
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:25.600]   have put into kind of make computer games kind of more socially acceptable and less
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.300]   kind of controversial, this is going to probably set us back like a decade or so.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.300]   But, eh.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.300]   Oh, bad news.
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.620]   The woman had the baby already.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.620]   You missed it.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.940]   I'm sure we can strip it on demand, right?
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.940]   YouTube would not shoot that online.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:42.940]   Oh, rats.
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:46.700]   Look at the kid too, right?
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.220]   It's like he's going to grow up and it's going to be videos.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.020]   Home videos of him is a baby.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.820]   Ah, Grant pirated videos.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.100]   Call of Duty 2 Modern Warfare.
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:04.500]   Carla of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is expected to be even bigger than Grant Theft Auto 4.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:09.620]   Now the most successful movie of all time.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:14.580]   The record for a movie release in the first weekend was the Dark Knight, 155 million.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.540]   Take a guest, kids, on what they're saying.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.340]   Call of Duty is going to rack up in the first week of its release.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:21.340]   500.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.340]   Fought, you're right.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:23.340]   Very good.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.340]   Oh, result.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.340]   You didn't know ahead of time.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.340]   You just made that up.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.340]   No, I just guessed it.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.340]   That was good.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:33.340]   Half a billion dollars in the first week, which would make it, if it happens, the biggest
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:36.540]   entertainment title launch of all time.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:37.620]   Half a billion dollars.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.780]   No wonder they're trying to write these games like crazy.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:47.780]   PC's Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, it'll be $60 goes on sale in the US midnight, Monday night
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.780]   Tuesday morning.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.780]   That franchise is huge.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.780]   It is huge.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.140]   It came out of no player.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:55.820]   I've played a little bit of the older Call of Duty.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.820]   Son loves it.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.060]   It's been around since the original PlayStation as far as I know.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.060]   Halo, it's taken over Halo.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.060]   Be Halo, be GTA.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.620]   I mean, this is the game.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.860]   Nobody plays anything else.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:07.860]   I'm Madden.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.860]   Oh, you're a sports guy.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.700]   See, that's different.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.980]   I think this is the two games.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.900]   That's a genre of its own.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:14.900]   Right.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.060]   Well, you know, there were huge expectations for Grand Theft Auto the last time, the last
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.940]   issue, and it didn't make those.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.940]   Right.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.620]   I wonder what is it that's going to...
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:28.220]   They could be wishful thinking at this point that they need the dough.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.220]   Look at the economy.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:33.140]   Look at the sales for GameStop and look for the sales of video game makers.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.300]   They've not had good quarters.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.260]   They're finding weak demand locally.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.260]   They're not.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.260]   They're not.
