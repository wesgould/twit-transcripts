[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.400]   gone by. But don't think this is going to be old news. Oh no my friends because we have a great,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.240]   great panel. All ex chromosomes today on the panel.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.200]   Look at yourself. Look at this. Be for yourselves, says Trey Rackliffe.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.440]   Trey Rackliffe is visiting from New Zealand. Everybody's favorite photographer.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.200]   He's just true. Just back from Burning Man. Yes, it was a hard week in the desert, but it was great.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.480]   And his mom lives up here. So he always brings us Fudge from Mrs. Rackliffe's Fudge which is
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.320]   fabulous. We've got to pass this around the live studio audience. You know, we better.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.560]   We better. Would you start this phrase here because we really don't want to have that in front of Leo.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.640]   He's going to eat it all. Doug K is also in studio with us. Doug of course, one of the
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.920]   proto podcasters from IT Conversations and the Conversations Network at ConversationsNetwork.org.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.880]   Now full-time in photography. I am. I am a full-time amateur photographer.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.240]   Yeah, I guess that's the way you go. I like that. If I call myself a professional, I have to pay
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.480]   more for insurance. You were a serial entrepreneur and we really, for a long time, you know, before
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.200]   there was podcasting, you were doing podcasting. So nice to have you back. Thank you. After a long
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.280]   hiatus, I apologize. I have not been on Twitch since you've moved to the new studio. Well, so welcome back.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.760]   Thank you. To your left, Ryan Block of GDGT gadget.com. Good to see you, Ryan. Two weeks from now,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.600]   a newlywed. Yeah, one, one, one only hopes. Oh, that's exciting.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.480]   Oh, that's exciting. I can make it. Is it nerve-wracking and the Ryan Block Veronica Belmont
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.440]   household? Yes, but not because of the wedding, more because of the Apple event this week.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.400]   Are you fighting over who gets the iPhone 5? No, well, I know that we'll both be getting one.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.440]   It's more, you know, preparations and late nights getting ready. And yeah, we put a lot of work
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.120]   into the live blog. And, Brian, are you both going to be on the same network? Are you going to do
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.280]   two separate networks with the iPhones? You know, I'm still deciding if I want to stay on AT&T.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.680]   I think we'll probably both wind up on sticking around on AT&T. I still have the unlimited data
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.120]   plan from way back in the day. You don't want to give that up at the same time. I hear such good
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.600]   things about Verizon LTE, especially in San Francisco, where AT&T is quite congested.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.400]   Yeah, we'll see. Yeah. I'm one of Verizon LTE phone. I don't know.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.600]   You know, and I made the mistake of saying, boy, I got reamed for it on the air that I thought
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.160]   that Verizon's LTE was faster than AT&T's. Never said, no, it's not faster. It's just here in the
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.240]   Bay Area where everybody has AT&T iPhones that you just can't get anything done at all. So,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   that's why Trey Rackliffe has emigrated to New Zealand. And Mike Elgin is also here from
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.720]   Elgin.com. And he's emigrated to he's a citizen of the world. Hey, Mike, good to have you.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.360]   I'm not there. If I was there, I'd be drinking scotch and eating fudge, but I'm here in spirit.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.640]   We try to do that to entice people. And all it did was chase you across the globe. You're wearing
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:31.120]   grease? I'm in Greece. I'm in the Peloponnese in Sparta, Greece. And yeah, it's one o'clock in the
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.520]   morning, one 11 a.m. here in Greece. But it's fantastic here. It's digital nomad. I had no idea
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.320]   you were up at one. I'm so sorry to make you stay up till 1 a.m. Oh, no, no, here, here,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.280]   around here, this is this is when there are bars nearby that don't even open until one. Wow.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.640]   And you know, you wonder why the economy's in the toilet. We know this is why.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:03.920]   When is dinner? Is it like 10? Yeah, 10, 11, something like that. But that's because the
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.720]   climate's warm and nobody wants to be out in the day in the hot afternoon. So you go to bed in the
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.320]   afternoon, you get up, you finish your work, and then you start the evening begins at eight or nine.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   Exactly. And you know, work starts late. It's, you know, all across the Southern Mediterranean
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.560]   from Spain all the way through to Turkey. This is the lifestyle. I think it sounds pretty attractive.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.640]   Yeah, it's a little different from Silicon Valley. For some reason, Trey Rachael, if I get the
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.160]   feeling that you get up at dawn and milk the sheep or whatever it is. Whatever it is you do.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.520]   No, that's not milking. Yeah.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.880]   She told me she was milking it. Yeah, there's this expression where he's saying, no, no,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.800]   I was just helping this sheep over the fence. Are you in sheep country? I am in sheep country,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.400]   but I do get up every day and I chop wood. I chop my own wood with an axe. Do you really
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.880]   lumberjack? Yeah, I might do some Instagram topless photos sometime. You know, I could tell he's
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.080]   been chopping his own wood. Is that what they call it? No, that's another. It is Queenstown for a
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   reason. All right. Now let's begin. Enough, enough silly, bad single on Tondre.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.160]   Ryan said he's getting ready for the event. The invitations went out as true to form Apple
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.680]   waited till one week before the event to say that they are having event long rumored September 12th
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.160]   this Wednesday at the Erbobuina Center. There's the invitation. It's got a big 12 on it for the
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.800]   September 12th, but the shadow it's casting as a five, which is interesting because it is not the
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.480]   fifth iPhone. It's the sixth iPhone rumored to be called the iPhone five. What do you think Ryan?
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.360]   Yeah, it'll be called the iPhone five. I guess so now that we've seen the number. Well, the
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.960]   the, you know, the four S was not the fourth. Right. It was the fifth.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.040]   I mean, who cares? It's five is what comes after four.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   Or is what's out now? Five will be what's I mean? I think I think when that invite went out and
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.360]   everybody really started, you know, getting, I think pretty irritated on Twitter that, that it
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.680]   might be called the iPhone five. I mean, who cares? Who cares? So they won't just call it the new
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.880]   iPhone. I doubt it. They wouldn't put the five in there. They wouldn't put the five in there if
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.120]   they were going to call it the iPhone. No, MacRumors.com app. They have a countdown two days, 18 hours,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.960]   45 minutes. And this perhaps the most bizarre article I've ever read, aren't Kim. He's talking
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.240]   about this is the staging of Erba Buena Gardens, this Erba Buena Center where they'll do the event.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:47.600]   Apple's already hung rainbow curtains on either side of the apple. If you do a little photo processing
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.440]   and squish it down, apparently I find this so bizarre according to rooster nugget and others
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.600]   in the MacRumors forum, you can see icons. Is that ridiculous?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.680]   So ridiculous because because the basically it predicts that the iPhone will have icons.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.400]   Well, it's an extra row. The icons are stretched. Okay, let's I'll give you the semiotics BS or not.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.080]   You can see the game center icons upside down that I don't understand. That's why that you see
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.680]   iTunes. You see a music icon. We don't know what the blue one in the middle. They think it might be
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   the stock icon. Then there's a mystery green blue icon Pandora. Is there Pandora? Yeah, that's the
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.800]   rumor that Apple might be doing a music radio. Yes, maybe that's what that is. You know, if they've
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:45.520]   lost the Samsung suit, we might see totally different icons. I mean, this is this has taken
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.920]   this way too far, but it just shows you how heated the rumor mill gets the day to before the Apple
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.160]   event. Well, I think what's interesting about this particular season of rumors is that all of the
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.000]   information we all feel like we know what this is going to look like. We've seen the cases coming
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.520]   out of China. We've seen videos of this thing. It's it's the same width. It's longer. It has a
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.440]   doesn't have glass on the back. We know a lot about the shape and the case. And we really,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.520]   there are certain things we don't know anything about. For example, we don't know is this thing
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:25.280]   going to have NFC and a huge play for some kind of Google Wallet competitor. There's also speculation
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:33.040]   that it could have fingerprint a fingerprint reader in the button. Apple. That's just a
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:41.440]   cool. Yeah, that's cool. But but if you think about the the logic of a big, if when they do do a big
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.920]   play for a digital wallet, it will probably have some kind of biometric component to it. And they
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.000]   did buy authentic in an awful big hurry for an awfully big price. And so that how long ago was that?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.080]   May, I think, okay. They started it. But I mean, they went in authentic authentic
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.920]   mex fingerprint readers. They make fingerprint readers NFC stuff. They make all kinds of digital
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:12.320]   encryption things. But the speculation is that they're particularly interested in the fingerprint
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   readers. But Apple approached them in a very unusual way. Usually they make very small
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.040]   acquisitions if they do make acquisitions. And usually they kind of hardball them and get a low
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.720]   price and all this stuff. Apple went in there and said, we're going to give you way more than your
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.160]   company's worth. We don't want you having anybody else bidding on this no counter bids. It's take
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:36.080]   it or leave it. And we were really in a hurry. So make up your mind. And it was a really
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.200]   an unusual acquisition that was characterized by a great deal of haste, which kind of makes you
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.440]   think, well, they're really trying to get something into products at the end of the year. So,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.760]   Mike, I don't know about that. I think part of it for Apple is they like to do acquisitions
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.400]   quickly because I don't think that they like to get in a bidding wars. And it's also a lot harder
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.240]   to keep its secret who they're trying to acquire if the talks get long and drawn out. It kind of
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.120]   reminds me of the Anno bit acquisition they did. I think it was earlier this year, maybe it was
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.800]   last year, I can't remember. But it was a half billion dollars. It kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.680]   Nobody had heard about it. Nobody really knew who Anno bit was. And it was just done. And
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.800]   it was kind of over. I think the timeline for getting their technology, for getting
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.880]   authentic technology into an iPhone is still too early. They couldn't make that happen in just a
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.280]   few months. These products get designed a couple of years out. I mean, it's possible. I think that
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.120]   it would maybe be if they were going to have something and they were finger-balling to be
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.080]   their next gen or maybe the gen after that. You're probably right. Every time you think that Apple's
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   going to be extremely aggressive about something like this, it turns out that they're not, they're
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:56.640]   they're very conservative and they're very slow with it. However, I think it's interesting that they
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.400]   paid such an enormous price. I think it was one of the biggest things they've ever paid.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:14.720]   And there's also a lot of movement in the digital wallet stuff. So I think it is a long shot.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.400]   But it is an interesting development and a very uncharacteristic one for Apple.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.480]   And so we'll see what's going to come out of it. But it's an example of the kinds of things that
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.960]   we just have no idea about despite our feeling of familiarity with this iPhone.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.680]   The Apple paid what seems like a ludicrously small amount, even though it's the largest
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.320]   acquisition Apple's ever made, but in things like Facebook buying Instagram for a billion,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.000]   365 million seems like chump change. That's not the largest one they've ever made.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.160]   It says according to a Guardian, it's the,
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   I mean, they bought, they bought Antibit for 500 million. They bought next, I think for,
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.560]   it was 600 million or 700 million. So it's a big one. It's clearly not a
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.640]   for Apple. It's big. Yeah. It's, you know, they don't, they don't buy a lot of companies.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.800]   They're not a company known for acquiring. And I should point out that the sale doesn't close
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.160]   until after the 21st. So I think it's not possible in fact that they'd be, well,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.360]   maybe it is. I don't know. But it just,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   I think it could still be licensing the tech. What I'm really hoping for. So since we, you know,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.880]   as we're going to have, what are we going to? Well, what I'm really hoping for, as Mike said,
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.520]   is, you know, we've seen so many leaks with this phone, we've seen every component from inside now.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.080]   Now the latest thing is it's supposedly not going to have NFC that that thing was just a speaker
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   that a lot of people were speculating was going to be an NFC. The thinking is that a metal back
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.360]   would make it impossible for it to be NFC. Maybe. I mean, you could do the front or, you know,
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.640]   you could do the antenna because supposedly there's the, the plastic, you know, antenna port up at
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:55.120]   the top. Here's my hope. My hope is that this whole thing has been a masterfully played ruse
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.280]   on the part of Apple and that the phone that they're going to unveil looks absolutely nothing
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.360]   like what we've been seeing. I doubt that will be the case, but I would love if they did that.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.800]   If they pulled the wool over everybody's eyes like that, it'd be amazing. Well, in fact,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.440]   they have to, there has to be some wool somewhere over somebody's eyes because if this thing is
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.600]   just another phone running iOS six and it's just longer, then this will be the worst Apple
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.480]   announcement in history. Yeah. But remember, Mike, we thought that with the iPhone 4S, this was
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.320]   such an incremental and you know, I was among others saying, oh, this is sad and all the pundits
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.520]   were disappointed. And of course, it's the best selling iPhone, but they really bumped up the
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.600]   camera in that one. That was a big, and they added Siri. I mean, Siri was, or was that when the
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.080]   four? No, it was Siri. No, that's the essence. Yeah. So they threw like something in there that
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.360]   was huge. And so far, there's not a lot of rumors about anything really significant.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   Yeah, next to a row of icons is not huge. Yeah. Especially since the rest of the world's already
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.480]   doing for, for which and more. Supposedly this will will have LTE. I don't know about that. I'm
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.600]   still a little skeptical about the LTE. Really? Won't they have to have LTE?
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.760]   Doesn't that know? No, necessarily. Does that not hurt them? I mean, even Verizon has said we
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.480]   are gonna sell gadgets that don't have LTE anymore. Yeah, I'm sure Verizon's gonna stop selling the
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:17.760]   iPhone. Positive. They're gonna do that. See, if Apple doesn't put LTE in it, they don't put NFC
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.600]   in it. It's almost to me, it's almost Apple saying, hey, we don't really care. We know you'll buy it
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:32.800]   no matter what we do. But isn't that isn't that the case? Oh, we don't care. We don't have to. We're
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.160]   Apple because I mean, there is a lot of competition now with Apple. I mean, the Galaxy Note 2 was
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.880]   announced last week by Samsung. We're seeing and we'll talk about all of these new Nokia phones,
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.360]   Windows 8 phones that look pretty interesting. I'm not going to say that the new Razer for Motorola
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.560]   is that exciting. But you know, and of course, we're waiting to see what HTC is going to do after
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.040]   the announcement. It's gotten very good. Android OS gets better and better and better incrementally.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:05.280]   I think so. I think Jelly Bean has reached parity. The maps are so good on Android and that has a
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.120]   long way to go on Apple. Well, Apple's dumping the maps. And Tre, you've hit it on the head. The
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.080]   thing that's really exciting about all this competition, besides the larger screens, it's software.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.400]   So we really don't know what Apple's gonna announce along. Yes, we do because they've
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.200]   because we've seen iOS 6. We've seen a few like we've seen apps like the podcasting app. We've seen
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.920]   iOS 6, but we don't know what kind of sort of, you know, that is separate from application software
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   that could go in there. I mean, we've seen passcode and things like that. We haven't seen the apps.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.960]   You're right. It could be apps. But they could throw in some crazy, good apps that, you know,
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.880]   go ahead, Ryan. Yeah, Apple also likes to sneak in stuff for the last minute for
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.120]   a new phone launch as they did this before, you know, Siri. When iOS 5 was announced last year,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.000]   WWDC, you know, there were betas and people's hands. Everybody had it. And then they announced
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.680]   the 4S later that year. The exact same pattern as this where they announced the 4S running the new OS.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.200]   And when they announced that, they also announced a ship date for iOS 5. And oh,
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.960]   they're Syrian side, right? This feature that nobody had seen in any of the betas. So they,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.760]   you know, they like to slip pretty cool stuff in there. I wouldn't assume that just because we've
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.880]   all seen iOS 6 that that is what is going to be the launching feature set. By the way,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:29.280]   a tip of the hat to Jason Calicanis who tweets he's listening right now over airplay in his Tesla
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:36.320]   Model S. Okay, that's a little bit a little bit of geek cred there. Yeah. Somebody in the
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.480]   chatroom said, and I think this is probably accurate that no one knows what NFC is. So not
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:47.040]   having NFC is not going to be a minus. But from the, from my point of view, I would love to see
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.000]   Apple jumpstart NFC by putting it in the iPhones wouldn't wouldn't we? I mean,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.520]   that'd be a chance to take the lead in something as opposed to I don't know if they're taking the
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.560]   lead NFC is available in the Galaxy S3, the Galaxy or the Nexus. But like you say, most people
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.440]   don't know what it is, but they don't know what it is. And stores aren't using it. So
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.720]   nobody uses that NFC. It's there. It's a spec. It's, I mean, there's no NFC story there.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.200]   But if Apple did it, wouldn't there be a story? Well, there could be there could be
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.040]   there would have to be. If Apple is going to do it, they'd have to go real big on it. And you
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.080]   better believe that if they were going to commit to it, it would be something that you get in,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.960]   you know, nationwide retailers, not not at the scale of Google wallet right now, which is actually
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:30.640]   pretty small still. No, I can pay it pizza coffee. And that's it. That's all you need.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.120]   What else is there? More people in town that use square and pay with square than use NFC.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.200]   I just, I think I would like to see the NFC jumpstart because I think the idea of, you know,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.120]   tapping your phone, maybe it's just me against a little paypoint and paying by entering a pin
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.760]   is a great thing. It's cool. That's, that's the way things probably will go. Is it just cool or is
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.640]   it valuable and convenient? It's both. Because that's, it's cool. It's not is enough for us.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.760]   Yeah. Well, if Apple wants to do it, they'll have to do it the same way they did with HTML5
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.360]   and just say, look, this is the future. And they kind of did change a whole sub industry by making
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.400]   that pronouncement. Now, Flash is really effectively dead. And they could do the same thing with NFC
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.560]   if they say this is the standard. I have to say, I don't know if it was Andy Inako. I think it was
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.720]   who said Apple doesn't announce things like NFC. They announce capabilities. Right.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.680]   Exactly. I think the other interesting thing about NFC is that unlike all of Apple's competitors,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.160]   Apple has the credit card of every single customer. They're kind of like Amazon in that respect. I
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.720]   mean, Google, you talk about the number of users that use Google, a huge number of, of, of activations
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.400]   every day that they brag about. Most of those in China, they're all over the world. And then even
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.880]   in the US, most of us have not given our credit card to Google. So, so getting Google wallet off
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.520]   the ground is very difficult. For Apple, they just throw a switch. There was even some speculation
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.160]   that they would use Bluetooth 4.0 instead of NFC. But they just have to throw a switch and they
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.080]   have already got people signed up with credit cards and ready to roll.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.080]   Yeah, I think Mike nailed it. That's that's something that Apple has that very few other people have.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.920]   300 million credit cards. You know how tough it is. I'm always entering my Apple ID though,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.480]   all the time. And if I have to do the gas station and everything, that would be annoying.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.280]   I don't want to enter my password. I would probably keep those safeguards in and that
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.200]   negates the convenience of NFC. Good point. The way that Google wallets implemented,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.160]   you enter a four digit pin, right? I think it's a four digit pin. I've never used it.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.800]   Well, let's get the Apple stuff out of the way. And then we'll go. I really want to talk about
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.760]   Amazon's announcements. Ryan, do you want to make predictions? Do you think you mean,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.000]   is there some secret sauce? And if there is, what do you think?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.280]   No, I think I think you should be prepared for a very straightforward announcement. I doubt there
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.000]   will be NFC. I'm still a little bit skeptical on the LTE, mostly because the chips, that's just
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.560]   chew up so much power. I'm not saying it's not going to happen. It could very well happen. It's just
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.120]   LTE right now is still a little bit immature on the chipset side. They burn off a lot of juice.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.560]   And as we know, Apple is obsessed with managing the power usage in their phones. And if this phone
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.280]   that we've seen leaked does have the battery that we've seen leaked, it's only going to be just a
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.800]   shred more battery capacity than we have now. So a really power hungry LTE chipset could
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.120]   could really blow up in their face in terms of battery use. So I'm a little skeptical on that one.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.520]   Wow. We'll have to see. Yeah, otherwise, you know, I think it'll probably be pretty straightforward
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.720]   release. 1136 by 640 four inches stall. Yeah, I can see that happening. Okay.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.080]   We know that iOS six will not have Google Maps. It'll have Apple Maps. We've seen it.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.040]   Probably Google will still be the search engine, right?
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:51.200]   But they'll probably take out YouTube. It's interesting. We'll get to this, but the Kindle Fire
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   uses Bing. No YouTube, but they'll be in both cases, Google will offer a maps in a YouTube app.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:06.080]   You could download Apple will replace those. Siri, maybe some big improvements with Siri.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.920]   We've seen some in iOS. We have seen. Yeah, they're definitely working to improve Siri.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.760]   I haven't personally played with iOS six yet. So we'll have to see how it goes.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.280]   All right. I personally think one of the coolest things they're going to announce is a new nano.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.120]   I think they're going to really go aggressive and turning the nano into a wristwatch. I think they
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.960]   could add Bluetooth to it, making it an iCloud device, enabling you to control, you know,
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:41.280]   ITV and Apple TV and stuff like that. With the nano? With the nano. Well, who knows? I mean,
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.560]   Bluetooth could enable all kinds of things. Playing music from the nano out through a speaker.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.000]   Would enable you to interact with your iPhone. Look at your watch to see who's calling, to see texts
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.520]   and stuff like that. Talk to Siri when you're wrist like Dick Tracy. I think there's a lot of
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.320]   cool things they could do if they really went aggressive turning the nano into a better wristwatch,
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.000]   making it the form. Right now, it's clean. You know, they have wristbands you can buy,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.800]   but they're bulky and clunky. They make it small and thin. I'd buy an Apple, a new glass.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.760]   I would especially put Nike Plus into it. If I still wore a wristwatch at all.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.840]   Well, I wear the fuel band, right? I mean, that's kind of wristwatch. Do you work for Apple,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.240]   sir? Because this guy's nodding. No, okay, just checking. I thought maybe we had a,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.880]   we had some confirmation here. I thought this was unlikely. You know, John Gruber, John Pachowski,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.440]   and all things D, the, uh, laconic Jim Dow rimple in the loop all think that there'll be an iPhone
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.320]   announcement. And then later, and I've had many announcements in October, Mark Gurman in the
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.120]   nine to five Max is, Nope, we're going to get new iPods, new touches, new Nannos,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.720]   Tweaks shuffle Wednesday. You think that's true, Ryan? Yeah, I think it's definitely possible.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:56.480]   They're not going to do three events. And, um, traditionally they've done one fall event where
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.960]   they launch all the stuff, uh, that is going to go out over the holidays for people to, you know,
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   buy up in, in, uh, droves and, uh, even look either they're going to launch the iPods on Wednesday with
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.640]   the iPhone or they're going to launch it at a, at an iPad event in October. I will say if they
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.840]   don't launch any iPods, uh, this Wednesday, then that is an absolute tell that they're going to
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:27.040]   have another event. Right. With an iPad mini iPad wristwatch. No. I mean, chest plate, maybe,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.280]   you know, either it's this big, I'll wear an iPad chest plate. A little team.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.080]   Another story. This from, uh, the New York Times in a move that could shake up the growing field of
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:46.400]   internet, radio, Apple plans to develop a service to compete with Pandora, sending streams of music
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.720]   customized as a user's taste. Three people briefed on the plan said late Thursday. Interesting.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.360]   Pandora stock tumbled when this came out. I was a big law law user back in the day. I love
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:03.760]   Apple. Yeah. And they haven't done anything with it yet. Maybe this is it. Um, that team must be
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   doing something. Why would Apple do radio? Spotify does it. Mog does it.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.840]   Artio does it. Yeah. It's a revenue. It's a path to more music. Is it a path to revenues? I mean,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:23.520]   Pandora spends as much as 60% of its revenue, uh, sends it to the music industry. Of course,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.800]   that means they keep 40%. Yeah. It also requires, uh, as this article points out,
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.480]   a lot of feet on the ground. You have to have it's the ad sales for Pandora. A lot of local
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.920]   sales is like almost a group on model. I don't, I don't think Apple wants ad sales. I'm not sure
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.600]   they're interested in that. I think that if they were going to do it, they would do it as a, uh,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.400]   as a kind of a premium service for iCloud users, uh, something to encourage, you know, the, uh,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.280]   the iTunes and the cloud functionality that they've been pushing a compliment for match maybe.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:59.120]   Yeah. That that's $25 a year. So maybe if you sign up for match, um, you also get the ability
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.560]   to, you know, stream customize music based on what's in your match library.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.240]   Um, Apple's plans first required by the journal on Thursday evening. The time says Apple service
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.720]   did not seem to be imminent given how long it takes to negotiate labels. So don't expect an
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.120]   announcement on Wednesday could be months away, according to the times. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.800]   I think that, yeah, I think that the most likely scenario is unlike Pandora, which basically doesn't
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.520]   even care what you own just plays. You pick a radio and creative radio station and it, you know,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.280]   brings you all these songs. Um, I think Apple could integrate listening to, you know, using the
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.560]   genius feature and stuff to, to listen to your own music that you own throwing in a minority of
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.440]   the songs being related to that or, you know, based on, you know, what you already own and what
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.160]   you like to listen to as a way of discovery because paying, if you recall, paying was supposed to be
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.200]   a way for people to discover music and nobody uses it. And so right now there's, you know,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.800]   how do you, how does Apple facilitate you discovering new bands, new music? I mean,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.080]   they really other than browsing the, their store visually, it's really not a good way to do it,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.840]   whereas a semi Pandora type thing that occasionally threw in a song you didn't own.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.920]   And, and again, the, the secret sauce here is Apple's ability to negotiate deals that Pandora
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.960]   can't negotiate. And so this could be a really cool thing, but it wouldn't, I don't think it would be
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:30.400]   a separate service like Pandora. I just see it as a way for them to legally throw in songs that
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:37.120]   you're likely to, to enjoy, you know, as a way to get you to discover new music and buy more music.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:43.920]   I wonder if Apple feels threatened by the unholy triumvirate of Pandora, Spotify and Amazon,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.840]   because at least maybe that's just me, but that's how I get my music. If I want to buy it, I'll buy
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.560]   it from Amazon. If I want radio, I love Pandora. I listen to it all the time. If I want to listen
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.440]   to an album that I don't want to buy, I use Spotify. I don't need iTunes. Is, am I unusual or is that
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.880]   kind of the trend? Is that how people are, what do you do in New Zealand? I squeeze a sheep.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.600]   No, I just depend on it, but it's a door. So I have to, oh, you have to fake it. Yeah, I take it,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.680]   pretend like I'm here, but Pandora is great for finding music. And I think Mike is exactly right.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.120]   That could be the music publishers that could be putting pressure on Apple. Like we need to increase
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.520]   our sales. There's no way for you to discover our music. Currently, the only way to discover music
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.880]   is to laboriously go into the iTunes store and click through categories and listen to samples.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.400]   And that's no way to buy music. That's, and I think it's only people in the know, right, that use
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.200]   Pandora and these kind of specialty services. I don't think like normal parents person,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.880]   Oh, I disagree. How do they discover music? They listen, they still listen to the radio in the car.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.960]   Oh, I think people have discovered Pandora. Every business I go into Pandora is on
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.000]   when I go work outdoors on. I think Pandora has been discovered by the real people. Absolutely.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.440]   It could well be that the contracts that Apple's had with these publishers have included
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.960]   something like the ability to put in a certain number of plays. They could have had that in that
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.640]   contract for a long time. That's one of the things the article says is that they will be a little
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.520]   more liberal in their terms than Pandora is you know, you can only skip a few times a day. You can't
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.320]   repeat a song. The Apple service. They're not going to say no to Apple. Right.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:22.720]   They like to say what's what's more powerful though? Is it a customized radio service like
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.680]   Pandora or is it listen to any music? All you can eat for X dollars a month like RDO or Spotify. I
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.920]   mean, for me, you know, I love Pandora and I still listen to it and it's a great discovery tool.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.080]   But that's not how I listen to the most my music. Most of my music I listen to because I want to
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.760]   hear the full album from this artist that just came out last week and what do you use for that?
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:48.080]   Spotify. I use RDO. But I use bottom. Yeah, I know it's six and one. I do both. I do.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.760]   I do. Sometimes I want to listen to the album. But sometimes I'll just do pure Pandora.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.800]   But both of these both poorly for the iTunes model. Yeah.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.440]   Well, the current iTunes. I mean, I think the iTunes model is much more easier to adapt to
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.200]   something that looks like Spotify or RDO than it is. There's something that looks like Pandora.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.120]   Pandora is a very different model. And what she's are bringing in ad revenue and stuff like that.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.240]   It becomes totally tricky. I think if Apple wanted to do the streaming, all you can eat
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.360]   service that we've been talking about for so many years about them doing, they're in a great
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.360]   position too. And right now, I don't think they're being threatened by Pandora. I think if anything,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.320]   they're being threatened by Spotify. Actually, and thank you Wordsworth for this reminder.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:34.480]   According to the Nielsen's, most teenagers listen to music on YouTube. Although radio is still.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   Yeah. If I look at my kids, yes, you bet. They watch YouTube Vivo maybe, you know.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.920]   But radio is still the dominant way the people discover music according to this Nielsen report.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.720]   48% radio. Tips from relatives, friends, 10% YouTube, 7%. But teens, when you go to younger people,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.880]   and that's going to be the harbinger of the future, 64% of teens listen to music on YouTube,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:07.760]   followed by radio, 56%, iTunes, 53%, CDs, 50%. But isn't it obvious why? It doesn't cost anything.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.560]   Right. They don't have a credit card. They're already on YouTube too.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.880]   It's Spotify. You just type in what you want to listen to on YouTube and it's there for free.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:21.680]   YouTube is what MTV used to be for your generation. Absolutely. Yeah, except you didn't have to watch
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.480]   the shows all afternoon in the hopes of seeing one video you've been waiting for. You just type it
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:31.760]   in. Right. And I would love to be a kid these days. And in those stats is the whole shareability
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   question. YouTube is the easiest place to share. You know, my kid, I took the Google TV off the
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.480]   main TV, said we used to, he was watching YouTube on the 60 inch TV in the living room with his
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.640]   friends. That's what they watched. They'd watch YouTube. Because I got two visual artists here,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   Doug K and Trey Radcliffe, just quickly. One more Apple story. The new images of Apple's campus.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.120]   This is exclusive to a nine to five Mac. They got the official blueprints. Doesn't this look
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:07.920]   gorgeous? Isn't this not beautiful? Like a W hotel. Big trees in the background. The only thing I
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.080]   noticed when I looked at these pictures and Trey's got them on his computer. You could just show
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.880]   because Trey's going through them. He figured out how to do this. Now show Trey's. He's got the big
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.600]   stuff. The only thing I noticed on this, do you still have Trey? Maybe not. The only thing I noticed
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.520]   on this is the massive scale. The humans are dwarfed. Look at that. They're dwarfed by the massive
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:35.440]   scale of this building. It's very communist in that way. Well, it's interesting. I don't know.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.320]   It's almost as if the corporation is bigger than the people who work there. What do you think?
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.160]   They look like kind of bugs me. They look like bits running around the computer. Yeah,
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.080]   they're tiny. Have you guys ever worked in a building with really low ceilings?
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.640]   It's not fun. Like John Nakovich. Exactly. There's like the seventh and a half
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:01.760]   floor. It's nobody wants to work in a place that's not airy and light.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:08.800]   But do people want to work in the mothership? They're in college. There's going to be a lousy
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.880]   segment of that donut where the direct sunlight just comes pouring in the window. And it's going
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.200]   to be like working at the church. Oh, no. Oh, Mike, you don't understand. These are polarizable
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.280]   glass windows. You push a button. In fact, forget pushing a button. It senses the amount of sunlight
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:34.720]   passing through and tunes itself to respond. Swipe to whatever. Yeah, darken. I just, it's huge.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:43.120]   But all right, the new five finger gesture. No more sun. Sun be gone. We're going to take a break.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.000]   We've got a great panel. Ryan Block is here from gadget. GDGT.com. You'll be doing live
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.400]   blogging of the Apple event. Yes. That's right. We got a we got a lot going on in the gadget.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.440]   Tell me about the team that you're going to put together there for that.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:01.360]   Well, we have we have a lot of people who work on these things. I go and live blog it.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.400]   When Apple is so gracious, they let me bring along a wingman to help do that.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.440]   Then on the back end, you know, we've got people taking the photos that we're taking and putting
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.400]   into the system. We have our whole engineering and ops team at Rackspace watching and making
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.600]   sure that we're not crashing serious business. It is really serious. And I mean, you do not,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.640]   well, maybe you do understand the the crush of traffic that comes through on Apple. You know,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.720]   it's just I do insane. It breaks the internet. I mean, it is one time at AOL way back in the day
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.920]   when I was still, you know, the editor of Engadget. And I was doing one of these things.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.360]   We actually took out an entire AOL data center because there's so much traffic. It crashed
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:49.120]   and as I understood, completely physically destroyed a $20,000 layer two switch. And it took out an
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.920]   AOL data center. I mean, it's ridiculous. Yeah. It's true. It's our biggest traffic day of the
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.280]   year easily. I mean, on the iPad announcement, we got to 180,000 simultaneous views, which is,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:07.120]   I never even thought we could do. So absolutely, it's interesting though, because this is a new
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:13.760]   medium, the live blog that pretty much was created by Apple, not streaming. It's it's announcements.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.120]   Is there a skill to a live blogger? Is there some is there some new journalistic skill that
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:25.680]   you've learned, Ryan spelling? Fast typing. It's challenging. It is. It is. I can only imagine.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.640]   And you've trained a lot of people how to do it. You're trying to convey the feeling of the
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.200]   event, but you also want the words, right? People are looking for the verbatim words coming out of
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.160]   Tim Cook or Phil Schuller's mouth. Yeah, you do the best you can. It's, you know, it's hard.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.600]   You got to you got to be be doing like 20, 20 things at a time taking photos and transcribing
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.840]   and describing what you're seeing and, you know, writing up the announcements and, you know,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.760]   coordinating with your team and making sure that the site's not gone down. It's creates.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.440]   It's really stressful. We will sleep. 10 AM Pacific is when the keynote begins on Wednesday,
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:07.760]   the 12th. That's 1 PM Eastern time, 1700 UTC. We'll also we won't be we do. We're a little lazy.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.880]   What we do is we watch the live blogs. Tom merits Sarah Lane. I as actor and I will be watching.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:19.040]   We've got Andy Inaco in the event and Jason Snell from Mackerel and they'll be joining us
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.520]   afterwards for Mac break weekly. And we're doing something a little different, Ryan, because we,
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.400]   you know, I like the idea of us carrying the stream and in the past, we've carried kind of
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.800]   pirated streams and there's always somebody who I don't know sits there with a laptop and points
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.760]   it at the stage and I feel kind of guilty rebroadcasting those pirated streams. So we've decided to
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.320]   do something different. I've commissioned puppeteer Brian Hogg, Toronto. He's going to do a Tim Cook
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.360]   puppet. We didn't have time to do Tim, Phil and Scott. Yeah. Next time. I also wanted to
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.200]   statler and Waldorf, which would be me and Dvorak, but we haven't we didn't have time for that either.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.000]   But he's going to be reenacting. So you can kind of get the feelings if you were there,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.520]   reenacting the event on green screen and we'll put the images up behind him and I'll make sure
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.560]   he's reading your immortal words and we'll credit. We'll credit science theater 3000. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.160]   Yeah. Leo, do you remember you remember last time with the with the iPad announcement? I actually
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.880]   went in there with you guys on Skype and I had Skype on my phone and I turned it on the camera
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.200]   like the outside camera and I was showing you the iPad from the event, you know, like the little
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.440]   hands on booth. I guess that's okay because we've done that in the past. No, that's totally
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.760]   legit. Yeah. It's totally we're hoping to do that again with Andy and Aco.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:41.520]   Becky Worley did it for us at the back to the Mac event. Unfortunately, Steve Jobs wanted by
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.320]   and she jumped him not physically, but she said, Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs asked him a couple of questions.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:51.680]   She's never been invited again. So I'm not sure I want to put anybody in that kind of harm's way.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.840]   I think puppets are really the way to do it. So we will also be beginning our coverage
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.400]   and you can watch along with us. You know, we're going to do trade and trade the master of this.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.240]   You the guy who turned me on. We're going to do a Google Hangout. We've started doing Google Hangouts.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.040]   So what I do is I open it to my check journalist circle, which is several hundred tech journalists
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.800]   and whoever gets in there, those nine people become our kind of Greek chorus, if you will, Mike.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.560]   You know, as the as the event goes on. Good idea. Yeah, it'll be fun. Yeah. We've done that before
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.400]   and that's worked pretty well. We're just like you, Ryan. We are mastering this new medium.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:31.600]   The streamless keynote. By the way, I'm getting a lot of hate on the puppet.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.880]   I wonder why Apple stopped streaming them because like every once in a while,
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.160]   they'll stream one. Right. And then they'll realize how hard it is to do.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.320]   And inevitably go down. It costs too much. Is that why they don't do it?
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.440]   Because the yeah, Apple doesn't. They're really lacking for money right now. Apple, they're so
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:58.240]   cash strapped. They're like, was it like $82 billion in the bank? Well, you know, what I thought
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.160]   was that Apple didn't do it because they wanted to control it. But obviously live blogging means
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.520]   they've lost control of it. They invite people who who type whatever they want in real time.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.280]   That's not the best way to control it. But there might be actually getting more buzz.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.080]   Well, now I think that's really what it is. Yeah.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   Because they put the video out immediately then as soon as the keynote's over a minute later,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.160]   doesn't doesn't that cost the same as streaming it live? They streamed it. They wouldn't have the
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:31.520]   live blogs. So reliability of the live blog. Well, you know, we do we try to live blog it even when
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.440]   they do have a live stream because those live streams usually go down. That's right. Yeah,
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.200]   they keep one even the live blogs go down cover it lives crash many times. You don't use cover
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.320]   it live anymore though. We've never we've never used it. That's why you always stay up.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.480]   Yeah. Well, I built it from the ground up to scale to this kind of thing. So are you a network
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.760]   engineer? Sir, we have somebody in the audience. You work for Google. The guy was just talking.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:00.240]   He's wearing a Google shirt, but he doesn't work for Google. He insists. But he says that the issue
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.840]   is it is very expensive to make a live stream like that reliable and robust. And I know that's
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   the case. I mean, I know Google goes Google goes crazy. They streamed on YouTube the Democratic
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   and Republican national conventions. And Colleen Kelly, who used to be our engineer and works now
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.840]   for YouTube and is an instrumental in that the kind of redundancy and hardware they have to put
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   behind that because you can't let that go down. Remember how hard it used to be just to do a few
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.760]   hundred? I know, right? I know. All right. I didn't. I think the quick thing, I think the three
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.320]   benefits actually, one of them is that they end up making sure that they don't look like idiots
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.280]   with a broken feed. Right. The second thing is that they get all the journalists to really,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.440]   really pay attention to the announcement. And all the fans and the public is paying attention.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.200]   And then when they release the video, everybody pays attention again. So they basically get
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.680]   everybody to really pay attention to what they're doing. But here's the here's the funny thing.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   I've been live blogging these Apple events for I mean, it's almost coming up on 10 years. It's
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:10.720]   a long time. And early on, you were not allowed to do this. If they caught you doing it, they
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.600]   would shut you down. And sometimes they would throw you out. This is not like they have not
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.760]   always been, you know, really embracing this phenomenon. I mean, at a certain point, they
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.000]   realized they couldn't stop it anymore. And so I think they just stopped trying to. But for a long
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.200]   time, many years during a gadget, we would have to try to do it on the slide when we got invited
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.880]   because they were not into it. They did not like people live blogging their events and they would
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.360]   ask us not to do it. And of course, well, you know, what do you do? Like, I'm there to do it.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.040]   There's no mystery about why I'm there. Right. Like, of course, I'm going to live blog it. Like,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.440]   if you don't like it, well, then I guess you shouldn't be inviting me. And you know, they came to their
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.040]   senses, but it hasn't always been this way. They haven't always been super progressive about
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:55.360]   people covering their events. They are, as you said, they really try to keep very tight control
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.480]   over their message. Well, there is absolutely no question that Apple has fully maximized
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.640]   the PR that they can get. This is the same thing they do. Same technique that Hitler used to
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:17.760]   empower his generals. On that note, let's take a break. Godwin's law has officially been invoked.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:25.760]   Ryan Block is here from GDGT gadget.com. Doug K from the Conversations Network and Doug K with
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.600]   an E.com K A Y E.com tray rec lift from stuck in customs. Trey is giving us a very nice
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.320]   coupon code we can use for some new stuff that you're doing.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.920]   Leo rocks that discount code will work for people if they want to. I just released my fifth book.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.560]   That's up on flat books.com. What's the book is called the beauty of ambiguity?
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:54.400]   It's a photography art. Also, it saves you money on Devorek isn't here, so I have to plug a lot.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:01.360]   It also saves you money on Trey's Lightroom presets, which I use in our great a bunch of presets.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.440]   I do too. I love them. I've been seeing your pictures on Google plus. Thank you.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.800]   And then the last thing it saves you money on is we released a new video for beginners to
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.320]   intermediate photographers called the art of photography. It's a great new video series.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:24.080]   Fantastic. Leo rocks the offer code one word on those three items. Also with us from the
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.240]   Peloponnese where it is the middle of the night and yet the party has just begun Mike Elgin
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:35.920]   of Elgin.com. And Mike, you've actually won the award. You have both been called an Apple fanboy
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.480]   and an Apple hater within five minutes in the chat room. Yes. Welcome to my world.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.960]   I figure you're doing something right. Our show today brought to you by Citrix, the folks who
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.440]   do go to assist. If you're in the IT business, if you do manage support services, go to assist
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:59.360]   is a must check out for you. Our friend and and IT guy here, Russell Tammany is actually a
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:08.240]   contractor, his company Expedentia has 800 plus clients, 800 plus companies and three people.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:14.800]   And he does it with, well, I have to say it wasn't go to assist until recently. He was using another
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.320]   very expensive tool. He says, I'm loving this go to assist. We set him up with it. So go to assist
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.600]   you've known about I'm sure for years, it's the best known remote support choice. But now they've
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:31.280]   added monitoring and this makes it a really useful tool. If you're an IT professional or you want to
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.680]   get in the managed support business, go to assist monitoring. You put the crawler on your client
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:43.520]   network. It finds all the hardware, all the software, every network attached device. So you've got a
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:49.520]   great inventory. And now you set up your dashboard to track performance on your network, key stats,
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.560]   even things, simple things like hard drives getting too full or toner cartridges running out.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:01.760]   You get alerts customized alerts via I am SMS or text message. So you are proactively paying
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.560]   attention to how that network is performing. It's how you can magically handle so many clients so
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.000]   efficiently. Then you fire up the unattended support module, the live remote and boom, you fix it.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.200]   Well, obviously for toner cartridge, you probably have to come down. This is a really fantastic
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.080]   tool and you could try it free both the remote monitoring and the remote support. Right now,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:28.000]   just go to the website, go to assist.com. Right in the front page there, you'll see a try a free
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.200]   button. Click that blue button. If you use the promo code, "Twit will get credit" and you will
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.640]   become a support hero. I'm telling you, this thing is amazing. We've been using it here. So I don't
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.120]   have to come in if I have to restart servers, things like that. It's just fantastic. Go to assist.com.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.440]   The offer code is "Twit." Boy, Apple hasn't even had its event and we spent 45 minutes talking about
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:57.040]   it. And yet on the 6th, on Thursday, Amazon had, I think, a very interesting event. Let's talk a
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.720]   little bit about the new Kindles. Five new Kindles, Paperwhite, which is an e-ink technology, I guess,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:08.240]   higher contrast. Paperwhite implies a white background. They always had that kind of gray,
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.720]   green background. It's supposedly faster, better battery life. In fact, they're still selling the
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.680]   least expensive Kindle they dropped that. In price gave it more battery life and faster page turns.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:26.960]   But most important, I think, the new Kindle fires. The Kindle Fire 7-inch, 8.9-inch, and then the 8.9-inch.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:36.080]   With LTE. Ryan, it seems to be, the real question on this was, how low can they go?
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:41.760]   And these prices are very aggressive, yes? Yeah. No, that's how they play and set their
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:52.080]   role with it. It struck me that it's almost a new era in computing where what really drives it
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:58.400]   is not hardware, not even software so much in the sense of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Windows,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.920]   but in fact, the store. It's all about the commerce. It's all about the ecosystem.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:10.720]   And Amazon is absolutely the best position. They not only sell books, magazines, newspapers,
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.840]   movies, TV shows, and music. They sell refrigerators and tires and toilet paper.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.880]   And this device, they're going to make money on, in fact, Jeff Bezos said it. He said,
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.560]   "We don't want to make money on the device. We want to make money after you buy the device."
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.680]   Right. And that's why their strategy is fundamentally different.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:34.080]   There's the store, which is what Amazon is. And then there's the App Store. They are not a very
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.520]   good App Store. Apple is the best App Store. But Amazon is an amazing media store and store for
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.000]   just about everything else. So if you're looking for a great media experience, that's what Amazon
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.640]   is banking on. They're clearly not going to win on apps right now. And I think they know it. So
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.200]   they're going to try to win on price and they're going to try to win on media.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:58.000]   One thing we don't know, by the way, the seven inch comes out soon. Like before the iPhone
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.640]   comes out, it comes out on the 14th. The Fire HD? The HD seven inch.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:09.120]   Seven inch. Yeah. And the specs are good. IPS, it's 1280 by 800. The 8.9 is even higher
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:18.160]   resolution, 1920 by 1200. The speed, it's dual core, 1.2 gigahertz processor with a fast graphics
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:24.800]   processor. I mean, on specs, it's funny because it almost seems like the hardware is secondary.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.760]   And yet Bezos did talk a lot about specs. I think more to say we're at parity than anything else.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.200]   But they must be selling this at no more than cost, right?
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.840]   I don't think they're making very much money on it. I mean, I think they had to talk about the
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:45.520]   specs because with a price as low as that, your assumption is going to be that the specs suck.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.760]   But people don't buy tablets based on specs anyway. If they did, then the iPad wouldn't be,
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:57.440]   wouldn't represent 70% of the market. So I mean, the specs don't really matter a
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.960]   time. I think that they're smart to get it out there that here are what the specs are.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:08.880]   We're not two generations behind. And we're certainly not in the place where with the original
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:14.320]   Kindle Fire, which just sucked. But they were still able to hit the price points.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.720]   I think it's going to be really about the experience though. And with a forked version of Android,
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.120]   I'm just not entirely sure that they've got enough value proposition.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:28.880]   I agree. And it's a real unknown. I mean, the hardware looks great. The ecosystem obviously is
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.520]   good. But is that software? And I think the only thing that really sucked about the Kindle Fire,
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:39.040]   the original, was the software. It was sluggish. It didn't feel snappy. It didn't look great.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.120]   The other thing that's, I know, the only thing that sucked about that car was that the engine.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.880]   No, software is important. I agree. Software is important. But price is important too. And I think
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:56.000]   the Kindle Fire's original sold very well because it was 200 bucks. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.280]   I'm one of those assistant mine back after the first week. Did you? First day, I should say.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:05.040]   Yeah. I mean, it wasn't as good an iPad as an iPad. And it wasn't as good a Kindle as my old
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.480]   Kindle because I love the Kindle because I can use it out in the bright sunlight.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.680]   Well, and the other thing that's really relevant to the right side of the table is,
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:16.560]   like the original Kindle Fire, this is a US product. Although I understand they are going to sell it
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.280]   in the UK. But can Amazon even hope to compete if it's not international?
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.360]   Well, I think international markets are going to go for these Android tablets.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.720]   Right. The Nexus 7. Yeah, they are international. And it is a huge part of the market. It may not be
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.480]   as much of the purchasing after getting the tablet activity, but the tablet itself.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.760]   Yeah. I think it's almost certain that they're losing a lot of money. I mean,
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.640]   the word on the street for the original Kindle Fire was that they were losing about 50 bucks
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.920]   per unit and then making it up in the long term, you know, through by selling you tires and toilet
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.360]   paper. But I think that this one, they're probably losing even more. That's probably one of the
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:06.160]   reasons why they offered advertising, which you can get rid of for 15 bucks. But I think ultimately,
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.720]   it's a losing strategy because as the prices go down and down, okay, so now they have the one at
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:17.200]   this price, wait, you know, what happens when tablets are below $100 routinely when they're below
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.760]   70. At some point, you're just going to be attracting the super cheapskates. And those aren't the
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   people who are going to be the big buyers on Amazon. So I don't think this is a good long term.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.680]   That's an interesting point. Yeah.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.440]   Yeah. Because he's aren't the right customers. Exactly. If you look at why Apple is such a rock
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.720]   star in terms of profits, it's because they go after the premium customer and they make money
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.480]   on the hardware. They make money on the software. They make money on the content. They make money
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:48.160]   on every part of it because the person they're attracting the most is the deep pocket, you know,
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:54.240]   highly educated big spender. And if Apple, if Amazon is going to go after the cheapskates,
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   then that's, you know, that works okay for now. But in the long run, that's not going to be a
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.360]   good strategy. Well, Mike, I agree with everything you said, except that Apple only goes after
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.160]   the deep pocketed, you know, highly spending individuals. So we know that that's not true.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.920]   It's just a slightly different. It's a variation on that, which is they make their money upfront.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.520]   They make sure that whenever they sell something, they make money. A lot of them.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:22.560]   No huge profit margin. There's no we're going to make money later with that. Right. They don't
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:27.760]   make money upfront. They don't do it. So, you know, look at the iPhone 3GS or, you know, any of the
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.600]   iPads since their introduction, those are products that are not premium products. The 3GS is now the
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:39.200]   free iPhone and the iPad has always been extremely price competitive. And now with the iPad 2 selling
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:45.120]   for $3.99, you know, in its class, it's still a pretty damn good deal. Do they do a minute?
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.400]   It's $2.50. I think so. But the difference is they will make money. If they cannot make money on
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.040]   that iPad mini seven inch, they will not sell it. Right. They're not going to wait until later
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.000]   and hope to make it up on iTunes media and stuff like that. It's just not how they do it.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.640]   And that's a direct opposite of what Jeff Bezos said. He said, we can, we don't have to make money
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.120]   upfront. We don't want to make money upfront. We want to make it long term over the. This is
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.560]   that long tail, isn't it? The long tail for Amazon is selling you products day after day
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:19.440]   on this device for the next couple of years. And I have to say that this is a strategy that the
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:25.280]   other big players, the other four horsemen of the internet apocalypse are paying attention to,
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:30.320]   because you look at Google and all of a sudden the emphasis on the play store, we didn't maybe
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:35.760]   understand it until now. You look at Apple, of course, the ecosystems always been a big part of it.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:43.840]   And even Microsoft is really paying attention to the idea of putting together content, music,
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:52.240]   TV, movies, and books and magazines to somewhat less degree, games and apps. And I think everybody's
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.120]   acknowledging that the hardware is going to take a backseat to content services and apps, right?
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:02.800]   Well, I think the way to look at this is that if you look at it from Amazon's perspective,
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.840]   Amazon is in competition with none of these people. They're not going to.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.760]   They win if that's the game. They win.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:17.200]   But what they're doing is they're using the means, the tablet concept, to compete with all the other
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:23.040]   electronic retailers. They're in it against Walmart and others who are selling things online,
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.600]   and they're using tablets as an advantage in the same way that they use overnight shipping
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:34.080]   and some of the other things that they do. And are they going to compete with Samsung?
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.680]   Are they going to compete with Apple? They're not even thinking about those companies. In fact,
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.520]   they want to sell those products through their through their kindles.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:47.360]   So they're really not even, you know, they're not a gadget maker. They're not in the consumer
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:53.680]   electronics industry. They're an online retailer and tablets are basically the if you look at it,
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:59.520]   when you order something from Amazon, it comes in a box. The box is the physical manifestation of
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:08.960]   what Amazon sells. They look at a Kindle as a box for digital content. That's all it is.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.600]   It's they're not in the box business. They're not in the tablet business. They're in the sell
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.240]   you stuff. Is that a bad strategy? It's a great strategy because it helps them,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:24.640]   to some degree, in combination with Amazon Prime and in combination with overnight shipping and
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.360]   all the other things they do to compete against the best buys and the Walmart's and all the other
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.520]   online retailers where people would alternatively buy the tires and the toilet paper and everything
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:39.520]   else. So it's an advantage against other online retailers. They're kind of like the Apple of
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.320]   online retailers in the sense that they always they're thinking really big. And they're thinking
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.200]   really ironically, they're not thinking internationally. I mean, the biggest growth is international.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:55.840]   You know, when you see you see Amazon or I'm sorry, Eric Schmidt talking about 1.3 million
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:01.520]   Android activations a day, that's not in the US. That's China. That's international.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:07.200]   Yeah. If you look at if you look at any of Apple's unit sales charts over the years,
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:14.080]   when they start to hit that like really aggressive spike upwards, that moment you can always pin to
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.920]   them launching internationally is just you can't you can't sell in the US only right that kind of a
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:26.480]   product and expect to be a market leader. And that's why Amazon only made $8 million last quarter.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:34.800]   It's not a big high profit business, but Jeff's always been willing to take a hit on near term
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.640]   because he's playing the long game. And this this is a long game product. Is it not?
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.560]   It's not a content creation device. And I guess that's the other question I have.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.200]   Is he saying doesn't matter? Nobody really wants to create content. The iPads are caught.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.880]   You can on the iPad, you could do a lot of what you do on Lightroom.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.360]   Well, you could do some of it serious professionals that create content don't really use an iPad.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.560]   We have big trucks like these maps, but that's a small market. That's a tiny market.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.120]   Me included, I use this for content consumption and really 90.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:11.360]   So is that the market is consumption not creation? Yeah, 95% of the world consumes
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:17.520]   the content that's made by about 5% of the world. It's changing a little bit. Now anyone can create
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.760]   content. We see everyone creating photos. We see people creating more and more all the time,
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.800]   but these are still largely content consumption devices.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:30.080]   You know, Lee, I actually if I can, I want to touch on something that you just mentioned,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:34.880]   which is Bezos playing the long game. I think that's a really interesting point. And I don't
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:43.520]   think a lot of people know that or think about how Bezos operates and he funds projects based on
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.280]   a 10 or a 20 plus year vision for things. But I think the interesting thing about that argument
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:55.440]   that, oh, he's playing the long game is that it's really easy to just assume that we're kind of dumb
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:01.200]   and that he's an incredibly brilliant visionary who's looking at things 10 years out.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.560]   And therefore his current strategy, while it doesn't make sense to us mere mortals,
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:12.640]   will all be revealed in five or 10 years. And I think the reality is that, you know,
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:18.160]   that's a tricky way of thinking because, you know, their strategy is actually not great right now.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.280]   And for many of the reasons that Mike already said, for many of the reasons we've already talked
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:26.080]   about, just because he's playing the long game and he's taking long bets doesn't mean that their
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:32.080]   strategy is good. Right. Although the example is
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:40.320]   in the stock market bust where Amazon really was a dog in the 90s up to 2000 because they were
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.080]   investing all their proceeds into distribution facilities all over the country. Now that
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   gambles paying off. Quite an asset. Yeah. And they survived when a lot of tech.com
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:59.520]   companies busted in the bust. I just I wouldn't bet against Jeff Bezos. But I agree as a challenge
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.520]   and I think the biggest challenge is he's not international. So there is no just as you said,
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.480]   there's no bump in that curve. He's got to solve that problem. And that's tough because
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:16.240]   all the content companies are very much anti global. They want their national fiefdoms. You know,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:21.600]   if they're if you're a publisher in New Zealand, you got the rights and you're not going to deal.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.840]   This is really hard because so much of the tech journalism is based here in the US.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.680]   Now I'm trying not to be biased. And now that I actually live in New Zealand and I'm trying to
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.720]   get US content, I always knew that it was hard for Europeans and people outside the US to get
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.680]   this content. I mean, we have money. We're willing to pay for it. We're ready. And it's just ridiculous
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.960]   that we can't get it. It's insulting. And it just reminds us that the world is really run by
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.520]   attorneys in the United States. And I'm very aware of it because we have a 30% of our
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.000]   audiences outside the US. And if we don't if we don't pay attention, they they've remind me
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.600]   constantly. Yeah, you can't get this stuff outside the US. Yeah.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:06.160]   The problem is that, well, I don't know about content, but for a retail operation,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.040]   it doesn't scale like it does. Apple, Apple can do an iPhone, they tailor it to the
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:18.080]   primary markets. And then they just roll out the same phone, you know, everywhere with little
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.120]   tweaks and little little changes here and there. But but it's very, very scalable. You want to go
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.480]   into a, you know, you want to go into Italy or you want to go into China or someplace like that
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.840]   with a retail operation. You know, you're talking about tax issues, you're talking about all kind
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:40.720]   of shipping, you know, the shipping abroad is not like it. It's not as developed as it is in the US.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.640]   There are all kinds of a bazillion little problems that require a bazillion people
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:50.160]   who are expensive and so on. So it really doesn't scale internationally as easily as a hardware product
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.160]   does. Well, you guys have really changed my mind. I came into this very bullish on the
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.240]   Kindle Fire HD. I thought Amazon's thrown down the gauntlet. Apple's going to have to respond.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:08.720]   Now I'm thinking, Oh, Amazon sucks. So Ryan bullish, bullish or bearish on Amazon
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.080]   bearish, but I think you also buried the lead. I think the Kindle paper white is actually
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.520]   interesting, interesting product. I'm more excited about the paper white than I am of
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:24.560]   anything else that they know. Tell me why. Well, so I've been using the the nook with glow light,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.160]   which is, you know, the nook version of the, you know, Barnes and Nobles version of the Kindle
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.320]   that has the backlit screen. They were the first ones to launch a backlit screen ebook
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.360]   greater. I love it. I don't love everything about the nook, but I love the backlit screen. I can't
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.040]   go. I can't live without it now. And the paper white has a light in it. So you can read it in the
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.720]   dark. Yeah, even though I'm not super obsessed with the nook, we named it one of our must-have
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.280]   gadgets because I think it's so great that it has the backlight. And so the paper white has that
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.320]   and an even better screen and, you know, even better typography. So I'm really excited about
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.480]   the paper white. I think I think that's actually the standout product. Is it actually a white
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.360]   background? Because that was for a long time, a real disappointment with me for the Kindles is
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.880]   it was kind of this gray green low-counsel. Yeah, it's kind of like a gray. You know,
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.920]   I wasn't there in LA. I didn't get to play with it, but I'm I'm reasonably sure that they would
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   not have named it the paper white if it was the same kind of gray yank background that we've been
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.040]   used to. Right. This is I mean, Ryan's exactly right because I think, you know, my wife and I
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.480]   each have an iPad and a Kindle because again, one's for indoor and one's for outdoor. Right.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.160]   One of your broken record on that, but that's a pretty fundamental thing for us.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.160]   And I think the paper white's going to solve that problem.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.880]   $119 if you're willing to put up with ads, which never bothered me on the Kindle. $139
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.680]   without ads available October 1st. You know, the problem with the ads though is that sometimes
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.840]   they'll have ads that they're not inappropriate, but they look weird. Like I was getting spa ads
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.800]   and it was like, you know, like a woman's foot on my Kindle. It was like the woman's
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.720]   you was like topless on like, you know, not topless, like from the front, but you can, you know,
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.960]   from the back and, you know, it's like a spa and like, what's there this naked lady on my Kindle?
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.800]   And right, you have to explain. No, it's just an ad. It's kind of irritating.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.720]   Veronica's really that uptight. Little bit. Yeah.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:24.160]   Ryan, there's a naked lady on your Kindle. So I was actually excited about seeing a $10 drop on
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.880]   the cheap Kindle, but now I'm thinking maybe I should take a look at this paper. Why? I did not
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.600]   order one. I ordered both HD fire. There's still time. I might have to order one of these.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.960]   Yeah. I buried the lead. Paperwhite's currently in the running for our top e-book reader.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.760]   Moving forward, as soon as it comes out and we get to play with it, we're,
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.320]   I think chances are we're going to be naming it our top must have e-book reader. Interesting.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.000]   And readers of gadget are concurring. They're excited about it.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.120]   Yeah, they are. I did bury the lead. I did not know that that was the hot thing.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.800]   I am a fool. It's okay, Leo. I'll forgive you.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.000]   Barris, you're bullish on Amazon, Doug K. Oh, I'm bullish overall. Sure. Long term. Yeah.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.760]   How about you, Trey? Bullish. They're awesome. Everyone's going to get everything they want to
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.560]   their home over the internet. In the US, we love it, but you're saying even in New Zealand,
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.160]   you're still bullish. Well, I think, I think you think they'll be able to make it international?
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   Yeah. It's just too, there's too many economies of scale. Yeah. It makes sense. Yeah. Or everyone
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.800]   to go through one or two. Do you have FedEx down there? Yeah, we got FedEx.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.840]   Check it. Yeah. I don't know. They spray paint the logo on the side of a sheep and
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:44.720]   bullish or bearish Mike Elgin on Amazon. I'm bullish for them as a retailer and as a maker of
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:53.360]   e-books as a creator of an e-books reading experience. I'm bearish on them as a competitor to Samsung
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.800]   and Apple. They'll never be a few of the best. They're not a hard work company.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:03.040]   I don't see them ever touching the iPad or some of the better tablets that are coming out
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.520]   from the real consumer electronics companies. But I agree, having that second device as a real
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.240]   reading device, when you're on the road and traveling a lot to, the other huge thing that they can do
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.560]   is battery life in addition to all the other benefits of a more dedicated e-reading reader.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.200]   Paperware has what? Eighteen day. I mean, it's a huge amount of...
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:29.280]   Yeah. I mean, way longer than an iPad. So, you know, I'm overall, I'm bullish on Amazon,
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.520]   but I think the scale of them is happening. Eight week.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.040]   Yeah, that's awesome. Eight weeks. That's so long that you actually forget.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.960]   You actually say, "Oh my God, I can't believe it." I have to charge it.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.440]   But that was months ago. Put it on your calendar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.920]   They recharged. Interestingly, no 3G. You don't have the Whisper net unless you pay $179.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.640]   Obviously, their 3G costs have gone up a lot. And what a ridiculous deal on the LTE
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:06.720]   Kindle fire. 50 bucks, you get a mere 250 megabytes a month. That's like a quarter of an hour of video.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:14.720]   A month. It's a few books though. It's books. It's only for books. I don't, yeah.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.240]   All right. We're going to take a break. We got a great team. I'm learning. That's always good for
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:31.040]   me. When I, by the way, I am... I'm bullish on Amazon. I would not want to bet against Bezos.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:36.960]   Ryan's worried me though. He's smart. He's worried. I'm with Mike. I think Amazon
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:45.760]   great company, totally bullish on Amazon. Bearish on Kindle fire. But not on Kindle,
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   on Kindle fire. Interesting. Yeah. I agree. For now.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.200]   Wow. They don't... They'll sell a lot, but I don't think they're going to make a huge dent
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.680]   in the industry. There is a tracking privacy issue with the Amazon's Silk browser. I'll talk about
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.840]   that in just a second. And why the Apache Foundation is going to ignore you if you're using Internet
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:11.200]   Explorer 10. But first a word from FreshBooks. I love FreshBooks. If you're a small business owner,
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.960]   it is the way to... Really, it's more... We talk a lot about invoicing, but really at this point,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:25.280]   it's more than invoicing. It is the tough part of your bookkeeping done. It is about getting your
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:32.560]   invoices out and getting paid faster. It's cloud accounting. Five million people now use FreshBooks
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.080]   to make their billing payless. I started using them in 2004. I was bitching to Amber MacArthur
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.360]   saying, "Oh, man, I got a bill in Canadian dollars for Rogers and US dollars. For my other
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.720]   clients, I never remember and then I don't get paid." She said, "Hey, Leo, try FreshBooks." And I did.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:57.280]   And I was amazed. This was one of the first web 2.0 services I used back in 2004.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   It is easy to use. And now with their iPhone app, you can actually do... You can... FreshBooks,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.200]   you can do everything you could do on a desktop from your iPhone, including keeping track of your
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.760]   hours, your billable hours, sending out invoices. When the invoices arrive at the clients,
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:22.480]   there's a button on the invoice that says, "Pay me now." So you get paid faster. It automatically
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.040]   you'll send out ticklers if they don't pay on time. You could do this all now from your iPhone.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:34.000]   This really... I tell you, this is the future of business. Go to the coffee shop, get work done,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.520]   track your hours, and when it's tax time, your bookkeeper will love you. Your accountant will
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:44.160]   love you because all of that data just goes right into their automated system. And it's very simple.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.080]   They'll even print physical invoices for a small fee. If you've got one of those clients,
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.680]   it's kind of old-fashioned. FreshBooks.com. You could try it free for 30 days, everything.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.680]   Everything for 30 days, unlimited use at freshbooks.com. If they ask, say you heard it on Twitter.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:09.280]   Save time, get paid faster with freshbooks.com. Highly, highly recommended.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.040]   It's funny because they got the squirrel with the umbrella. There was a survey. Citrix did a
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.240]   survey and something like 35% of the people they surveyed thought that cloud computing didn't work
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:29.920]   as well when it was raining. Tornadoes maybe, but rain, I don't think so. Amazon Silk Browser,
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.920]   which is in all these Kindle devices, the Fire, the HD, they're getting an updated version of the
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.800]   cloud-accelerated mobile browser. I haven't noticed to be honest a big improvement in Silk
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:47.360]   maybe because the original fire was unimpressive hardware. But apparently Amazon is going to be
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:57.920]   tracking user behavior all the time. They're watching for breaking news based on your behavior.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.160]   They do it anonymously? Is it tied to your Kindle account? No, it's anonymous.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.760]   It's not as if they don't track your IP. I don't care. The browser detects
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:11.360]   which websites a user tended to visit more often. Pre-caches the content. That's part of the
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:18.880]   how it speeds things up. At the same time, by watching user behavior across a large number of sites,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.800]   Amazon says, "Our browser is capable of detecting these aggregate user behavior patterns." That's
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.440]   the anonymous part. It's aggregate. Detecting the next page you need before you even know it
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:38.560]   and will even know apparently when Morgan Freeman dies. They're going to have a start page,
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.840]   including a trending now section, the stuff that's trending from other Silk viewers. I think it's
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.080]   kind of interesting. What's new about this? Google's been doing this for years.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:55.520]   With what? Their search? Yeah, when you click on an entry in Google Search,
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.280]   yes, sure. Search does that, sure. Yeah. In fact, it factors into the results.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.040]   And then the results get reshuffled based on what people are clicking on, especially if you're
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.080]   logged in and you have friends. The things your friends are clicking on bubble up to the top.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:19.680]   This isn't really that newer interesting. I don't think there's any other major reason
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:28.640]   for them to even have a browser. It's all about it. Everybody's doing it. There's no downside to
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.280]   it. And ultimately, in the end, you could have some really good contextual advertising.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.000]   So I think this is really why they have a browser.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.480]   Let me talk a little bit about tracking cookies because this is similar.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.040]   I first of all, I think the whole problem with tracking cookies is the name.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.800]   If they had just named it, add personalization cookies or add personalization customization or
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:57.600]   something, people would not be so upset about it. But nevertheless, there is now a do not track
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.080]   standard. And all the new browsers except for Google's browser will allow you to click a button
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.760]   that says, "I don't want to be tracked." And websites are expected to honor this except
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.560]   that Microsoft's Internet Explorer 10 will have it turned on by default.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:25.200]   And that is not the standard. The standard is that do not track should only be an explicit
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:32.320]   choice by the user. In other words, the default should be "unset," not either on or off, but "unset."
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:39.280]   And if a browser doesn't do that, then websites have the right to ignore the setting because the
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:46.960]   user has an express and opinion. Apache Foundation, which makes the most common web serving software,
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.400]   I mean, I think 90% of the web uses Apache, says, "Yep, that's right. That's why we're going to ignore
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.760]   the IE10 do not track setting. We don't have to. We, in fact, shouldn't it break standards?"
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.920]   Discuss.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:10.000]   Well, this goes back to the last millennium. I was involved with a startup that
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.560]   was you doing tracking with cookies. And it's not just a matter of serving ads. It's all about
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:22.080]   correlating your online identity, which is supposedly anonymous to a real world identity.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.160]   So you set a cookie as an ad server. You set a cookie that is unique. It doesn't say "dug k"
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.440]   anywhere in it, but it's unique. Right, but it's relatively simple to ultimately correlate that
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.200]   with other things about me. And there's all- Over time, you can aggregate that.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.480]   Yeah, all industry that does that. And once that link is made, then my behavior is, in fact,
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.760]   known non-anonymously. I think it's a big deal. I mean, it's an old discussion we've had it on
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.800]   Twitter before. But it's real. I don't like it.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.480]   So you would turn on Do Not Track?
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.640]   Well, I would. But I'm also in the Scott McNeely get over it. You have no privacy.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.400]   Privacy is dead. Get over it.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.080]   Right. I'm in that school too.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.040]   Just because I know I can't really stop it.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.480]   I feel I have some standing to talk about it because we don't use tracking and none of
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.240]   our advertising uses tracking. So I don't really have a dog in this hunt.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.080]   But I also worry that we get a lot of free web services based on the ability to advertise
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.960]   effectively and that these tracking cookies, I think, are a way to do that. Ryan,
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.080]   gadget depends on tracking, I would presume.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.680]   No, not at all. We don't track.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.160]   Really?
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.080]   I mean, there may be some tracking on it.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.520]   Your advertisers don't track?
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.920]   I can't say for sure. So our ads are sold through a third-party network called Same Media.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.560]   So we work with them closely. They're kind of like our external sales team.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.200]   There may be some tracking. I can't say for sure. I don't directly benefit from it.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.080]   If they do anything like that, it's outside our zone.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:02.720]   Well, what if they said to you, look, the rates we pay are based on our ability to target ads.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:09.280]   And that ad targeting requires targeted ads. Actually, it's not been proven,
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.680]   but the theory is targeted ads are more effective. And the rate we're paying or
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.720]   we're charging depends on our ability to do that. And if people don't track, then we're not
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.760]   going to be able to pay you as much.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:27.120]   Well, I mean, so first of all, I know that contextual advertising, so advertising based on
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.520]   a tracking cookie is not what we have on our site. So if Same Media is doing it,
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.200]   they're not doing it on gadget. But if theoretically they came to us and said that they wanted to do
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.960]   that, I'd say no. And fortunately, we have the ability, not everybody can.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.160]   But we have the ability to say that because we have multiple different revenue streams.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.960]   So we have our events and we have our affiliate stuff and we have our API stuff.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.360]   So we're making money in a number of different ways. We're not necessarily only dependent on
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.360]   advertising. Advertising is just kind of another natural way for us to make money.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:03.280]   Ryan, are you indirectly benefiting from cookies, from Google? When you go look at your Google
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.080]   Analytics and they give you a breakdown of the kind of people that come to your website,
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.920]   I assume that that all comes originally from cookie data, even though it might not be your website
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:20.800]   that's leaving the cookies. No, Google doesn't, as far as I know, Google doesn't host individual
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.680]   and unique data in Google Analytics. Analytics is all aggregate and anonymized.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:32.880]   There are some services that we use. We use tracking analytics to understand user
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:39.280]   behavior on our site. So we use a service called Kissmetrix. And that is, it doesn't necessarily
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:44.160]   track you as a human. It tracks what you do on the site though. So we can see, okay, if you started
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.520]   on page A and then went to page B and page C, what are the actions you took to get there so we can
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.400]   understand how to build a better product for you. And that's obviously a completely different
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.120]   thing than what we're talking about, which is trying to tailor ads and offers at you.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:05.760]   Right. What do you think, Mike? I think it's interesting that users are being steamrolled
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:12.320]   by both Microsoft and Apache. And here's what I mean by that. There are some users who might choose
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:18.640]   IE because they have been told or they understand that it's more secure for technical reasons that
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.600]   they don't understand. And one of those reasons might be this whole thing that they turn this
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.960]   thing off by default. And so what Apache is doing is they're saying we don't care about
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:35.840]   user choice when it comes to choosing a browser, we're going to eliminate the benefit that they
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:43.360]   chose that browser for behind the scenes without asking. So that's one way they're railroading
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:49.920]   users. Microsoft is also railroading users because essentially this thing can either be on off or
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.440]   neither in the sense that most browsers, as I understand it, are supposed to have
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:02.880]   unset as the default. Exactly. And so by setting a default, Microsoft is kind of ignoring user
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:10.480]   choice as well. So I think that I'd like to see both these companies try harder to give users what
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:16.560]   they want and not assume that users are dummies who can't be trusted to control their own settings.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:23.120]   Right. Well, again, I've learned from you, Doug K, because if you think tracking cookies are a
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.480]   bad thing, I'll have to change my I don't mind I don't mind add customization. If that's what
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.920]   they're used for, I think that's a good thing. I want to see more relevant ads. I don't have a
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.760]   problem with that. I think it's a much bigger picture than what what what what what information
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.720]   are they gathering about me and what are they doing with it? The key is not the information
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:47.040]   together. They have IP addresses, for example, right? They have latitude longitude because you're
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   router, right? There's all sorts of stuff, right? Right. So let's say they have my location.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:57.120]   The the key here is to be able to correlate any of that with the known part of you.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:03.360]   Leola port your social network. And then what? Well, they are they stealing my identity?
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.200]   No, it's it's still going to be a probably a market. Are they following me around? Yeah,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.320]   they're targeting ads to me. Yeah, I'm a better at the potential is to do so much more than that.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.880]   Yeah, I understand. You know, it gets down to credit. It gets down to medical information.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.040]   The potential potential would be nefarious. They would have to be committing criminal
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:29.600]   criminal acts like stalking me or identity theft. I mean, otherwise it's just ad tracking. It's
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.720]   just customizing. And if you don't mind getting. I like getting better at about the junk mail in
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:39.760]   your mailbox. I don't like spam. I think it's spam also. Yeah, I mean, it's all that. Right,
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   because because it's not like spam got worse because of this, though. I don't know, spam
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:49.440]   filtering is so much better than spam isn't really the problem. Right. But the fact is that.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:54.240]   And by the way, they can't identify uniquely without cookies. But the thing is that they're
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.640]   they have the ability not to target. I mean, look, you and I have public email addresses.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:03.520]   You know, we're on every possible list. Where's a bad example? Let's take somebody in the chat
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.880]   room who's a normal person. We don't have no. I don't think that's wrong.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:16.320]   But the fact is that that based on what I do online, people have the ability to know that it's
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.680]   Doug K, right? Leal, LaPour, trade, right? But that's that's something that marketers will say the
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.320]   name is noise. I don't want the name. Well, not the name. It's everything else about us. It's our
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.680]   address. The only the one thing that I've ever heard that is potentially nefarious is an insurance
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.320]   company saying, Oh, Leo just ate a lot of fudge. We're going to raise his rates.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   That's the one thing I've ever heard. But what are you're you're something that
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.760]   because no one's doing something doing something nefarious that the potential isn't a problem.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.520]   Right. And I'm saying the potential is right. Is it the government we have to worry about?
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:53.280]   Always. Always. Okay. A bunch of libertarians. Ah, yes.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.360]   Well, I'm I'm I may not be in that game, but I do worry about what the government knows about.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.760]   I do too. I don't worry so much about what I'm a libertarian advertisers.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:08.480]   Certain days. Yeah. We're going to I want to talk about Nokia's announcements. I think in
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.600]   I'm sure Ryan, you have some opinions on this. Some very interesting announcements, but is it as
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:22.160]   Farhad Manju asserts too little too late to save Nokia? We'll find out. Speaking of the government,
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:28.880]   the turns out the FBI is pouring a billion dollars into a new face recognition project
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:39.120]   that's going into effect soon. By 2014, you're not going to like this. So if you're worried
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.480]   about the government, you're not going to like this one at all. Now it's bad enough that they
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.640]   recognize the cookies ain't nothing. So not the FBI knows what I want to say.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.840]   They ain't nothing compared to this. But first, let's talk a little bit about if you are paranoid
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:57.360]   why backup. Actually, I'm going to do stamps first. Let's do stamps.com. Then I'll talk about backup.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:03.200]   You know about stamps.com speaking. You know, the federal government, you go into a post office,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.760]   they are going to track you. They're going to track you right? No, they're not. But I have to say,
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.840]   it's not the best experience in the world going to the post office finding parking going in there
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.640]   by instant. What do you need to buy stamps for when you could print stamps, legally print stamps
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:24.160]   with your computer and your printer? You can with stamps.com. Stamps.com has been around for a long
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:29.840]   time. I've been a customer for it. I think 10 years now. And the idea is Mac or PC,
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.360]   you get a USB scale. It's part of the deal. I'll show you in a second. You plug the scale into the
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.400]   computer. You plop the letter on there. Stamps.com says postage is this. By the way, it can print right
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.000]   onto the envelope, which is cool. It could take it. You could do invoices or billing and stuff from
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.360]   QuickBooks. It could take the data out of your QuickBooks, print the whole thing,
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:55.280]   print the whole kabosh on the envelope. It can fill out forms. If you're an eBay seller or an
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.960]   Amazon seller, this is huge because it takes the data right from the website, prints out the label
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.080]   with everything you need. If you're doing international mailing, really great. When you got a male
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.600]   fudge of tray, this is for tray's mom, it'll fill out the international forms. You do not have to go
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.960]   to the post office. And then the mail carrier comes and they picks it up and they take it.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.880]   In fact, you can schedule free pickups if the mail carrier came already. And there's no size
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:25.520]   limit, no weight limit. It's a great deal. I want you to try Stamps.com. Visit it right now.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.080]   See that offer? You only get that special offer and that smiling picture of me from about 100
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.160]   years ago. That's when I first started using Stamps.com. By clicking on the radio microphone in the upper
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:41.280]   right hand corner and entering the offer code TWIT, then you get the smiling face and the $110
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:47.600]   bonus offer. Yeah, we've increased it more postage, $55 in fact, a free postage, a free digital scale.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.760]   You only pay the shipping and handling for that. That's about $5. You also get a $5 supply kit
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.560]   to make up for that and the free month of Stamps.com. This is the best way to try Stamps.com.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:03.360]   Visit the website Stamps.com. Click the radio microphone. Use the offer code TWIT and never go
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.240]   to the post office again. I like that photo. You look like a creepy postman. I look very creepy.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.080]   There's something. It's from the screen savers days. Can you get a stamp with your picture on it?
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:19.760]   Yes. That's how I became a Stamps user. Early on, they had a business where you get the Avery
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.000]   labels and you can print your picture on the stamp. I still have them. I'm going to tell you
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.160]   how long I've had them. They're 33 cent stamps. That's how long I've had them. Stamps.com. So,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:36.640]   the FBI is going nationwide. This is according to the next web. A billion dollar budget.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:43.520]   It's called the Next Generation Identification Project. It's already legal in some states and
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:51.120]   will go nationwide in two years. It uses state-of-the-art biometric identification services to provide a
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:56.800]   quote, "flexible framework of core capabilities that will serve as a platform for multimodal
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:03.120]   functionalities." Lockheed Martin is making this. And of course, it's for public safety.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.440]   But basically, they just want to put more cameras up and the cameras know who you are and where
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.800]   you are and can pick you out of a crowd. Have you read Daniel Suarez's new book, "The Real
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.640]   Decision?" Exactly. Bingo. It's not going to tell they combine the face recognition with drone swarms.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   Drone swarms will say, "Hey, let's go get Trey." They'll just automate everything.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.360]   We'll fly you back in the United States if you don't pay those taxes.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:33.600]   I mean, does this surprise anybody? I know. It doesn't surprise me. I just want to tell them.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:40.720]   By the way, the project page says, "Privacy considerations are built into NGI."
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:48.000]   Oh, yeah. NGI developed a privacy threshold analysis way back in June 2006. A privacy impact
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.120]   assessment for the interstate photo system has been completed to assess NGI compliance with the
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:59.520]   Privacy Act. A systems of record notices is being updated to reflect NGI capabilities.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:05.680]   They've also, I don't even know what this means. Basically, now the FBI says it's legal.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:11.680]   I don't like it. I don't like it when the FBI decides it's legal. It's legal. Don't ask.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:17.120]   And what I want, the thing is that Google has this capability. You know what Google does?
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:21.520]   Facebook does. Facebook does. But they don't turn it on. They don't turn it on for privacy
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.920]   concerns. Well, if the government could do it, I think we should be able to do it.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:30.400]   Yeah. I think that just to clarify, because this is like a really complex,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.280]   nefarious sounding thing, and it is potentially. But what essentially what they're doing is everybody's
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:41.840]   familiar now. Everybody who watches CSI or whatever is familiar with the fact that the FBI maintains
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:47.040]   a fingerprint database. So if you're a city police person, you find some fingerprints,
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:53.040]   and you want to run it, you run it against the FBI's database to find the crook. They want to
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:58.880]   expand that from fingerprints to all kinds of things, including tattoos, biometric ID,
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:05.280]   iris scans, and face recognition as a type of biometrics. And so what they really, and they're
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.960]   actually part of this billion dollars is going to put systems into local police stations. So they
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:18.560]   can say, "Oh, look, we found a tattoo and they can just run it." Somebody robbed a bank, the camera
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.920]   in the bank got their picture, and then let's do a comparison to see if this person has ever had
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:29.200]   a mugshot. Now, the problem with this, it's all legal and it's all fine, is not just the slippery
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:36.880]   slope. But once that database exists, then the NSA can get into it. The CIA can get into it.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:44.480]   The China's NSA can get into it. Once it exists, then you can just do this big match. And you know,
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.840]   like right now, the facial recognition stuff is pretty good. It's 80% range, depending on the
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.960]   lighting and so on. Come on, five years, it's going to be amazing. They're going to be able to,
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.000]   it's going to be like a minority report. And as you walk down the street, they're going to be,
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.520]   "Hello, Mr. Anderson." And it can be able to pick you up like that.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:08.160]   See, that's why I think worrying about tracking cookies is worrying about the smallest possible
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.960]   problem. When the FBI can use databases to correlate your movements, they don't need
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:18.880]   tracking cookies. But when they can correlate your face to what you've done online, supposedly
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:30.080]   in private. Do you guys ever watch a person of interest? No. Season two is coming. This is an
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:39.440]   amazing show. Basically, these two guys are super heroes, but instead of super powers,
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:46.160]   they have incredible hacking skills and a supercomputer. And they track everyone and they listen
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.800]   on everybody's cell phone mics. And they do all this amazing stuff. And most of it is pretty plausible.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.040]   I mean, they do hacking much quicker than you could really do and stuff. But most of the stuff is
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.280]   pretty reasonably plausible. And there was a hilarious line late in season one. By the way,
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.080]   season two starts in a couple of weeks. But there was a late season one, they had this hilarious
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.600]   thing where the super genius who created the supercomputer, the tracks, everybody said,
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:15.040]   "Oh, yeah, I invented social networking so that I would have this massive database of profile
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:24.480]   pictures enabling me to match and identify everyone in the world." And his name was Zuckerberg.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.080]   Exactly. But yeah, people voluntarily put their mugshot.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.920]   We always thought it was just because he wanted to meet chicks.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:46.320]   No. So the Lumias, Nokia had an event, showed off some new phones, including
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:52.880]   top of the line, Lumia 920, running Windows 8. Mary Jofoli, who does our Windows Weekly show,
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:58.160]   was there. She said, "I just begged them and they let me put it on an open palm so I could just
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:03.440]   feel how heavy it was, but they wouldn't let me touch anything." It's just not-
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.560]   Paul was a good sign. Yeah.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:12.000]   And then to just kind of underscore this, Nokia does an ad in which apparently all the footage
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.280]   and the pictures were faked. That was done. Another great sign.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:21.040]   In fact, I guess if you zoom in, you could see the camera man.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.960]   You could see the DSLR and the reflection.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.600]   Yeah. Not so bright.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:34.000]   Yeah. Bad news for those guys.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.120]   The reflection. I don't know why they faked it because it actually might be not a bad title.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.120]   I know why they faked it. They showed another one.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.560]   It ain't done. It was real.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:44.640]   Like that's the real one that they posted in their apology letter. That's not too bad.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.920]   It's impressive enough.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.640]   I don't know. I'm sure Ryan Block has experience with companies doing this.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:56.000]   They did invite the Verge to go out in the park at night and take pictures,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.040]   but they did not allow the Verge to shoot video. This video is shot not by anybody but Nokia.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:05.760]   The speculation is that Nokia- that it's not done.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:11.360]   Well, you know, the funny thing is in the video game industry, this is totally allowed.
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:18.800]   In fact, it's almost unusual if you are showing something in the video game industry
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.600]   that is not pre-rendered footage that will look basically nothing like what an actual game or
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.320]   an actual game console will look like when it's released. It's kind of standard practice.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.440]   In the gadget world though, this is a highly unacceptable and for good reason because games
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:37.920]   are sold for their experiences, whereas gadgets are sold for their capabilities and what they
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:46.400]   can actually do. And if you're selling a product at its launch based on photos and video that
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:51.680]   it's not going to be capable of taking, you're directly misleading people. It's not good.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:57.760]   They made a huge bundle of this launch. It's a boo-boo. I wonder if Apple doesn't do the same thing
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:03.440]   though. If you look at the Apple TV commercials and look at the FaceTime videos, those look pretty
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.400]   darn good. I don't know. I don't think those are real. I think they're fake those too.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:15.120]   They're better at covering their tracks though. You don't see a reflection of the DL SLR in the
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:23.120]   white van as she goes by. So this is the verges. Look, there you go. There's the guy.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:32.000]   Whoops. That's just ham-handed. Now that's not no key at some agency.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.880]   That guy actually has a really multi-thousand dollar image stabilization rig attached to his
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:42.240]   house. Did you recognize what was going on? No, I think you can tell what's going on. It's one of
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.880]   those steady cams. Steady cams. Steady cams. Yeah.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:54.000]   So I guess some of the speculation is that the hardware is not done, but even more telling,
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   perhaps, is that Microsoft still hasn't released the SDK for Windows Phone 8,
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.600]   the software developer's kit, which means maybe Windows Phone 8 is even more delayed. Farhad
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:13.440]   Manju writing in Pando Daily says, "It's kind of over for Nokia. Once again, Windows Phone is too
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:21.840]   little too late." Do you agree, Ryan? Everybody likes Windows Phone? It's hard to say. I don't
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.280]   think that we're going to know until they pull the plug or until they really start to win.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:34.320]   But the problem is the battle is not fought in the cell phone market. The battle is not fought
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.080]   on features and on usability and oftentimes not even on price. The battle is fought
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:47.280]   by what the cell phone sales representative at the store is telling you what to buy.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:51.760]   That's the reality. Not everybody realizes that. That's where the rubber hits the road.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.760]   It's starting to become a little bit more apparent, but this is why when
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.480]   Palm, before they were required by HP and basically shut down, they realized that they were getting
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.720]   killed not because the product wasn't good, although the product was not the best product on the
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.880]   market. I think we all know that. It was a good product though. They realized they were getting
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.960]   killed because the cell phone retailer partners were not selling them on the ground. They made a
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.920]   huge effort and there was a lot of press about this where they sent out, palm representatives,
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:26.640]   to the stores to basically hand train the sales representatives there. They even sent out a ton
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.880]   of tester devices for the sales reps to actually use and sometimes keep, specifically with the goal
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.280]   of getting the people on the ground, the boots on the ground, selling their phones.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:43.520]   And the reality for Nokia is Windows Phone 8 or not, it almost doesn't matter if people are trying
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.640]   to sell an Android device because that carrier decides it's got the best profit margin. That's
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.320]   what they want to push this week or because somebody walks in the door wanting an iPhone,
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.680]   that's what's going to sell. So I don't know. It's a very complicated question.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.040]   I wouldn't rule them out, but things are not looking amazing.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.240]   Microsoft responding to this by, I remember this was a few months ago announcing that they were
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.880]   going to start paying the sales reps, I think 50 bucks for every Windows phone they sold.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.480]   This was something that's called the SPIF. Yeah, there were other companies were already
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.440]   doing the SPIF. And so if you went into a Verizon, for instance, they'd steer you first to the iPhone
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.600]   and if you didn't want that, they'd steer you to a Samsung Android phone and you could ask them
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.840]   about a Windows phone, but they would say, no such thing. Even AT&T, which really featured
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:34.160]   the Windows phone, people reported, we just never tell you about it. But on the other hand, I think
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:40.960]   people come into a store and ask for the iPhone. They don't need to SPIF. Right? Well, that's it.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:47.280]   Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. Well, I think that's the other part of the problem is that Apple
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:55.120]   has spent many, many years establishing itself as a very cool company that the Apple stores help a
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:03.200]   lot. But it has just a fantastic brand. It's just an incredible brand. And Microsoft doesn't. Microsoft
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.160]   seems like a company from the 90s and Nokia seems like a company from the past. When you think of
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:14.240]   Nokia, you think of those old Symbian phones and all that stuff. Neither one of these companies
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:22.640]   has got a lot of cache or a lot of, it doesn't have the geek street cred of Android phones. It
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:29.200]   doesn't have any of the good feel good things. And the other thing it doesn't have is apps.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.920]   And that's really the thing that-- And it's really not going to have apps if they don't get an STK
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:40.000]   out fast. Exactly. I mean, look at how far ahead of Android and Apple are with apps. And they just
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.600]   they're just nowhere. The too little, too late thing is a persuasive argument.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:51.600]   You know, one thing on that as well. Apple is succeeding in the market,
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.720]   succeeding its cell phone retailers in spite of the better efforts of some of these guys.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.800]   There's been a lot of press in the last few months about how AT&T is actually not really pushing
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.640]   the iPhone and how they're pushing a lot of Android devices, especially because there's a lot
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:12.000]   higher profit margin for them to do so. So Apple is still winning. Although, one of the topics on
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:24.560]   the rundown is how the Galaxy S3 is now supposedly the top selling smartphone in the US. But Apple
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.400]   wins because of their brand, because people come in, they want that. They not because the
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:33.040]   retailers are pushing it. I think Apple is kind of unique. I think, for instance,
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.920]   one of the reasons the S3 is selling so well is because Apple customers know there's a new iPhone.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.720]   I mean, Apple's customers are much more aware and alert than the customers of any other brand.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.520]   And so they-- I mean, that's why the sales have tapered off of the 4S. People are waiting.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.200]   They know. They know what's coming. Well, and there's also another factor here,
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:55.440]   which is a lot more elemental. And that is, I walk in the store, I say, "Give me the iPhone."
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.320]   Right. Now, what are you going to do? You're going to do another Nokia? Give me the
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.960]   Nokia? I mean, it's like they totally shot themselves in the phone here. I mean, okay, look,
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:08.240]   the Lumion 900-- Take the gun, leave the Nokia. The Lumion 900 is not a great name.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:14.640]   Lumion is an okay name. 900 is a bad name. 920. So you add plus 20 to the existing 900.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.200]   I mean, it just sounds like another commoditized piece of crap. And even if it's a great phone,
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:22.640]   they're shooting themselves in the foot. I mean, it should have just a real catchy,
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.320]   spiffy name that people say, "I want that thing." And nobody's going to think, "Oh, I want the
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:34.880]   Lumion 920." I mean, come on. It's too bad, because it's-- Do you agree that the Windows phone
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:43.120]   8 is pretty sweet? I mean, it's a nice OS, I think. It's snappy. It's innovative. That camera,
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.800]   despite the blot on the escutcheon that is the ad, I think the camera's going to be very good.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:53.840]   I think I'm like a lot of people in that I really look at this phone and think, "Wow,
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.400]   that's really-- wow, curved glass. I actually love the--"
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:03.680]   It's pretty. I love the Microsoft Windows 8. Look, I theoretically like everything about it.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.080]   Never would-- I would never consider that.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.880]   I think there is the problem. Yes, that's the problem. I think a lot of people feel the same way.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:19.280]   It's impressive, but give me my and then they'll insert their existing preference.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:25.680]   There's a lot of-- people have their contacts, either in Google or in their iTunes or whatever.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:29.600]   Moving your contacts over is a big hassle to a lot of people.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:38.560]   Before I got a Windows 7 phone, I went through quite a few steps setting up or updating my live
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.680]   account. It's not too bad making sure it imported the contacts from Google and the calendar from
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:49.600]   Google. Once you set it up, by the way, this is also true of Windows 8. You log into your account
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:57.200]   and everything's there. But you've got to take the time to do it. I agree. It's difficult.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.720]   Microsoft does claim, by the way, that users prefer Bing 2 to 1. That's a Google.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.520]   That's a shocker. They would claim that. They surveyed Bing users. No, they have a thing.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:15.040]   Go to Binginon.com. This is actually a great ad campaign. Binginon.com.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.280]   What you do is you do searches at Binginon.com. We'll do a few that you understand.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:29.440]   I think you do five rounds. Then you look at the side-by-side. Let me do HDR photography
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.120]   since Trey. You do quite a bit of HDR, too, Doug. I do.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.880]   Yeah, I'm here. Then you look at the two results. We don't know which is which. They've
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:46.800]   randomized it. Trey's images appear on both of these. These are pretty close. I'm going to say
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.480]   it's a draw. You go through this. Trey is the apple of HDR photography.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:56.400]   He really is. Those are identical results. Let's do Petaluma weather.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.800]   These are the kinds of searches people might do on Bing. I don't know which is better on that.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.000]   What are you going to rate it on the icons? The only thing I don't like about this,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.440]   and I don't know if it was my fault or something I clicked, but by the time I'd gone through all
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:19.360]   five of these, and by the way, for me, Google One was really close. One of them says it's 74
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.320]   once, it's 79. Which one's right? That's the question. That matters.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.640]   Is weather underground or the weather channel? I don't know. Better consumption.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.440]   I'm going to say I like the 74. I think it's more accurate. Let's say,
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.160]   Queen's down New Zealand.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:46.160]   Same results. See, this is really kind of what's interesting about this. They're indistinguishable.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.960]   I think actually that's the best result you can get out of this.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.760]   Is that, oh, Bing's not bad. I don't know about the two to one.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:59.760]   All right. How long have the people that I've read who took the challenge said that
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.640]   they preferred Google, but then Microsoft then told them, yes, but other people like, yes,
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:11.760]   that's exactly what happened to me. That's exactly what happened to me. So, okay, I've done it.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:20.880]   Bing one on mind. But only by one vote. Like you, other people chose Bing over Google
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.160]   two to one in blind comparisons. So, this is successful. Now, the funny thing is, and I don't
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.320]   know if this is, let's see if this happened. Because after that, all my searches were now on Bing.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.080]   Who goes to this site and how did they get them to go there? That's the question.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.640]   I guess people who watch this show. No, it stayed Google. Thank goodness.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.800]   All right. Enough of that. I just thought that was not nicely done. I feel bad for Uber.
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:52.960]   The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission says Uber cannot legally operate a taxi app in New
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.160]   York City. This is an example of the Taxi and Limousine Commission really not looking at for
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:04.000]   customers in New York City. Sure. It's another union thing because Uber is awesome.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.920]   Uber is awesome. Yeah. I used it just once in San Francisco.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:13.520]   Well, what was the reason for that? They don't, they say Uber can't do credit card processing.
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:22.240]   Uber will be so uber offered a free week to New Yorkers. In fact, through Tuesday,
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:29.440]   you get a free ride worth up to $25 if you use Uber. Apparently, really what's going on is the
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:35.360]   Limousine and Taxi Commission has an existing contract with Verifone and creative mobile
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:42.560]   technologies that require that they use Verifone terminals and so sorry. That was
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:49.280]   a smart phone app. Nothing. It's not a good idea for Uber. That's a great idea. Anybody's used
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:55.200]   Uber a lot. Absolutely. All right. We're going to take a break. We'll get a couple of crumbs
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.760]   after this. We're almost out of time though. I don't want to take too much more of your time.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.640]   Great team of people here. Brian Block, he's preparing, he's girding his loins.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.920]   Do you do? Is there a beverage or anything you take or drink before the live blogging begins?
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:17.600]   Apple juice. Coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. Coffee. Do you coat your fingers with special
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:24.560]   resins? Yes, I do. If I'm typing so fast, they start to light on fire. I smoke. Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.480]   What kind of computer are you going to use for this? I'll be using a Retina MacBook Pro.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:36.080]   Nice. Good choice. Will you be using 3G or the Wi-Fi in the building?
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:41.440]   I'll probably try to use the house Wi-Fi, which will invariably go down about 3/4 of the way
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:47.440]   through the event. So you will bring your own Wi-Fi as well? Yeah, before we're not too.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:53.840]   Like five of them. You know, at WWDC, it's a lot harder.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.680]   This is smaller. It's a couple hundred people. The saturation is not so bad. So you don't need
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.960]   as many backup options. He's getting ready. Yep. It's like it. I'm giving away all my
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:10.640]   trade secrets. It's like the Geek Olympics. I love this. Well, you know, and it really is,
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.680]   because I'm not going to tell you, and I'm sure I'm not alone, open up seven or eight tabs,
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:20.800]   and all the live blogs on them. And I go back and forth, and whoever seems to be really on it,
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:24.720]   that's the one that's going to get the views. Well, geez, thanks for the vote of confidence.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.480]   Well, you're one of the tabs. You're the front most. One out of eight.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.760]   I'll be on gadget. All right. I'm sorry. I'm watching gadget.
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:35.840]   That's the only place you need to go. G-d-g-t.com.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:41.280]   That's right. I'll tell our Tim Cookpuppet that's the one he's got a quote. So give us lots of
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:47.840]   good quotes. You got it. Mike Elkins here. How is the thing? It's by three in the morning in the
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:56.480]   Peloponnese. Almost. Almost. Almost. I'm to go out and party with the locals. Not yet though.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.840]   What you join us was so cool on Mac Break Weekly about a month or two ago. And I didn't even know
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:06.480]   you'd move to Greece. And you were in a cafe. You were outside. We watched the sunset. It was
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:13.040]   beautiful. I felt like it was there. It's gorgeous. Yeah. Yeah. It's the local sport to be at those
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:19.760]   cafes. Every single person is out there. It's it is gorgeous. And in this part of the of Greece,
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:23.440]   there's the soaring mountains just right next to the town. It's really beautiful. Now, you're
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.840]   drinking Uzo or Ritzina? You know, I haven't I on this particular trip, I haven't drunk either,
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.400]   but I've tried a lot of really good local red wine. And it's a pretty amazing stuff. And
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.480]   it's inexpensive too. But this is a great area for red wine. And you know, I've discovered also
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:48.160]   that a lot of people make their own Ritzina and and and Uzo and all that stuff. There's a lot
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.080]   and wine. They just make it at home. Sure. Why not? So it's a little pine salt. So that's right.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.680]   That's right. Wine. Oh, what's great. The bathtub setup.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:10.720]   I'm making feta in my bathtub. Oh, Trey, Ray Radcliffe is also here from Queenstown, New Zealand,
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.600]   and points very south. This is going to be one of the most international. I love this.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:22.400]   Trey has 1.8 million followers on Pinterest. It's that's just my two of them are guys.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:28.480]   Hey, that's where the girls are. Yeah, I'm very in touch with my feminine side. Every
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:33.280]   day. And then I see a cuff with some nice lace work and I just got to pin it. Now, in fact,
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.480]   he does photography. And one of the things you're doing, which I really like is you're doing
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:43.680]   long, thin photographs to fit the column structure of Pinterest. And it's beautiful. What is the
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:49.120]   name of that particular board? That board. It's an exhibition I did called cropped for Pinterest,
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.760]   right? I went through some of my favorite photos and I cropped them in that long, skinny format.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:49:00.000]   It's so cool. I think art should be, it should make sense in the medium in which it's displayed.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:07.040]   And everyone consumes art in different ways now. So this just seems to be all right.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.560]   Isn't that fun? I love it. Yeah, it's great. Trey is one of the most creative people ever
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:16.160]   met. I mean, just constantly like, well, that's just a brilliant way to maximize the that format.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.320]   Oh, you cynic. You just he's just going for the social media.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.280]   No, it's great. I love it. No, it's really pretty. It's really it's an exhibition. It's an exhibit.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.400]   Do you ever do like physical gallery exhibits? You don't need to. Sometimes I had a piece in the
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:37.120]   Smithsonian. What? Really? Yeah. What was that? It was one of my shots from Austin. That's neat.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.360]   And well, you know what I use as a night light in my bathroom?
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:46.720]   Your picture of the shuttle and you and you and you got it mounted on that thing. What is that
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:53.520]   lights up? Right? Yeah. You know, I have a secret camera embedded in there. Yeah. And you're and
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:50:00.720]   cookies too. So when I get never mind, this show brought to you by our friends at Carbonite.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.640]   It's the right way to back up because it's got the stuff that you need automatic. So you don't
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.400]   have to remember it continuous. So it's always going on whenever you're online.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.000]   By the way, using SSL. So you don't have to worry if you're in an open access spot or anywhere.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.280]   It's just secure. You can even add trust. No one encryption if you want. So Carbonite is absolutely
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.960]   100% private. They don't have the key you do. And it's online, which means, you know, there was just
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:29.280]   a tornado in Queens on Long Island. I was supposed to be in New York this week. I'm glad I'm
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:32.800]   unbelievable. That just me anywhere you are. You know, you could be backing up to a hard drive
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.120]   next to your computer. That's fine. In fact, I'd say do it. Don't not do it. I'm sure Trey has
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.520]   lots of different backups, but that's not enough. You want one that's offsite in case of tornado.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:45.920]   It's Queens. You don't want it to destroy your backups along with the originals. That's where
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.040]   Carbonite's so great. You don't have to think about it. And it's very affordable. $59 a year
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.720]   for everything on that computer. They have plans for external drives, multiple computers for small
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:03.600]   businesses, so forth. But try the basic plan. $59 Mac or PC. Visit carbonite.com. I just ask that
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:09.120]   you enter Twitter in the offer code. So we get credit for that. It's great. Every laptop gets
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:15.280]   carbonite on it because that's, you know, that's it. Carbonite.com, the better backup plan. We
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:21.280]   thank Carbonite for their support. I got to tell you this story. We talked about this guy on Twitch
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:26.960]   a while ago. The guy sells glasses and abused his customers. That guy's a character.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:34.560]   And said that there was a New York Times article about him that said he actually he actually
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:42.400]   improved his Google ranking. He says, my name is Stanley. It's not his Stanley. It turns out it's
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:47.920]   a Vithali with that with decor. My eyes was the name of the site. I just want to let you guys know,
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:52.960]   the more replies you people post, the more business and the more hits and sales I get, my goal is
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:52:01.360]   negative advertisement. And he was just horrible. He says he says he stumbled upon the upside of
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:08.240]   rudeness by accident. I stopped caring. Customers lied and changed their mind in ways that cost me
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:13.920]   money. So at some point I started telling them off in the bloodest of terms. And the contention
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:19.040]   was because of the Google algorithm, Google can't tell about sentiment. They just tell about links.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:27.520]   So all those links are all those angry customers. Pull them up in the ranking. Well, I just just
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:37.280]   so you know, this is a lesson to you all. Crime does not pay. He's going to jail. Four years in
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:43.600]   federal prison, $100,000 in restitution and fines. He was arrested shortly after that article.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:49.600]   About 16 months ago, pled guilty in today. He's finally sentenced. He says, as I stand before,
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:54.080]   his name is Vithali Borker. As I stand before you today, I'm genuinely deeply sorry for threats
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:59.360]   I made to say that I am ashamed of myself is understatement. I've had the big mouth and I
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:05.440]   could not control it. Moose and squirrel moose and squirrel. Anyway, that's an update on the story.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:11.040]   Mark Zuckerberg is not going to sell his stock. He's going to hold on to it. He says for at least
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:16.080]   a year, that helped a little bit. I'm sure he's always trying to be different. Yeah.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:21.760]   He's now there's another guy who's in it for the long run, right? Yeah. Did you do what Mark
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:28.000]   Cuban said about all that? No. Yeah. He has a contrarian piece about that. It was on tech meme.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:36.400]   On his blog, Maverick, I think I did see it. Yeah. Yeah. He took a contrarian view. He said that
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:42.000]   Facebook did exactly what they were supposed to do. Yeah. Yeah. Because people are whining about
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.280]   Facebook stock being half its price, its initial public offering price of 38 bucks.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.960]   He said, no, that's what the CFO is supposed to do. Facebook raised $10 billion. I thought,
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.760]   actually, I kind of thought this was right on the CFO's job at Facebook is not to manage
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:04.400]   shareholders portfolios. His job is to help Facebook succeed. And he says, as for all the
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:09.840]   poor employees that are going to have a bad strike price, that they can do the same thing that Google
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.480]   did. And just they can reprice those shares for the employees. It's not the end of the world. And he
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.360]   gives examples of when Google did that. Rebrite the options at half. Yeah. The Starbucks has done
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:25.680]   it. Google has done it. Yeah. You know, those things are all true. It is not Facebook CFO's
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:34.640]   responsibility to manage their investors, portfolios and all that. But it is Facebook's
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:41.760]   responsibility as a public company to provide value, to create value for their investors. And,
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.200]   you know, if they can't create that value, if their stock price just keeps going down,
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.640]   they're not going to have investors, which means that they're going to be in a very poor place
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.600]   financially. So, you know, on the one hand, that's absolutely true. And Mark Cuban
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.560]   piece is dead on. It's so smart. But on the other hand, it kind of doesn't matter because,
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.880]   you know, like it or not, they are now a publicly traded company. And they have to deal with that.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:11.600]   It's a good point. I mean, I've also heard people say, Hey, if you invested in Facebook at 38 bucks,
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.440]   you obviously didn't read Mark Zuckerberg's letter to the shareholders. It said,
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:19.760]   there's not going to be any more. It's not going to be any money here for a long time.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.760]   Or even the prospectus was showed. I mean, if you paid attention, their revenues were dropping
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.720]   every quarter. This wasn't a big surprise. So, you know, I didn't buy any Facebook stock. So,
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:37.520]   I don't really care. But if you did, I'm sorry. And I guess it's a long term hold.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:43.760]   Big copyright issues. This is something I've complained about a lot with YouTube blocking our
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:50.000]   videos. Well, it even happens to the best of them. YouTube flagged Michelle Obama's speech at the
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.520]   Democratic convention. This video contains content from WMG SME associated press,
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:00.800]   UMG Dow Jones, New York Times Digital, the Harry Fox agency, Warner Chappelle, UMPG publishing
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:07.280]   Andy M.I. Music, one or more of whom have blocked it in your country. They did get it back up. But
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.440]   this just shows you that the automated internet, the automated copyright takedown requests are
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:16.640]   just out of control. You know why they thought it was a copyright infringement? It's because
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:20.880]   these people say the same thing over and over and over again. We've heard this speech. They're
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:25.680]   infringing on themselves. Actually, there's a couple of reasons that happens. I'm sure there was
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:31.120]   music in that Michelle Obama video that they showed. So, that's probably some of it. But the
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:35.120]   other thing that happens, then I've seen this happen before, it happened in NASA. Local news
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:40.640]   channels took NASA's footage of the Curiosity landing, embedded it in their local news,
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.760]   and then the copyright, the robots saw the local news said, "Oh, there's the foot. Oh, there's that
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:51.360]   foot." And they blocked NASA's footage, the original that they was in the news channels.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:56.960]   Ustream did the same thing, shut down the Hugo Awards because these are the big science fiction
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.120]   awards and they were live streaming it. The Academy Awards of the science fiction, where they show
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:10.560]   clips from the nominees. There was a case where a guy made this goofy local commercial or something
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:17.840]   like that. Jay Leno showed it and mocked it on his show. And then the guy got shut down by NBC
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:27.040]   because he had posted the original that, I mean, it's a typical case where somebody makes
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:31.440]   something original, somebody else rebroadcast it, and then they crack down on the original
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:38.000]   content creator. I think we know why this happened. Our mutual friend Colleen forgot to flip this
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.240]   switch on that video that said, "Ignore copyright claims." There's a whitelist.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:47.840]   Yeah, this is the whitelist. Colleen, please whitelist these Democratic National Adventures
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:51.280]   speeches next time. I've been begging her to whitelist Twitter and we still get taken down.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:58.160]   Brad Huntsable, who's a very nice guy at Ustream and a good friend, CEO over there,
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:04.000]   said, "We use a third-party content management system, V-O-B-I-L-E, I guess,
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.560]   V-O-B-I-L-E, and it was an automatic trigger." He said, "If you paid for a pro account, this
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.880]   wouldn't happen because we automatically whitelist pro accounts on Ustream."
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:22.240]   We have never been blocked on Ustream, but we do get takedowns all the time on YouTube.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.640]   Some of it, I think, is from Brazilian companies where I think that they're really just trying to
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:30.880]   game the system, right? They're just trying to get ads. It's very rarely a takedown. It's mostly,
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.960]   "Well, we're going to stick our ads in your content." I think you shouldn't have shown those weather
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:42.240]   reports. Right there. There you go. All right, I think that's it. I think that's every story that
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:46.800]   happened this week, every single thing, anything you could possibly want to know.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:50.560]   That you would want to know, and I am just thrilled that we could get these great people in here.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:56.560]   Ryan Block, I wish you luck on Wednesday. We will be reading everything you write, verbatim.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:02.880]   Thank you. I appreciate it. Live.gadget.com. There you go. Just go there.
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:09.040]   We'll auto-update it for you. I like that. I hate that refresh, refresh, refresh.
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:14.000]   Yeah. We'll do our best. If something breaks and pops and destroy a router,
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.040]   somewhere at our data center, then it might go to manual refresh mode.
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:21.200]   But hopefully that hasn't happened for a long time. Hopefully, we'll be able to stand up to it.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:25.440]   That was really interesting that it happened in AOL. I thought that was really interesting
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:31.600]   and same. Wow. In gadgets, they do a great job too. They handle way more traffic than we do.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.320]   Those guys deserve props as well. You are going to have trouble live streaming the
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:39.280]   wedding, though, because I think that's going to be the event of the year.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:44.000]   We should have subsidized it with advertising. Rax, please.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.400]   It brings you the nuptials of Ryan Block and Veronica Belmont.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.920]   Hey, I don't know if I'll see you. I probably won't before then. Congratulations. Are you going
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:58.480]   away for honeymoon? Later this year, I think. Yeah. These two are hard workers.
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:04.640]   Speaking of which, if I may, just very briefly, we added some really cool stuff on gadgets.
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:10.640]   Yes. We added a really awesome gadget finder tool. It's longtime users of the site.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:15.200]   Might remember it, but we took it down and we totally rebuilt it and it's way better now.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:18.560]   If you go to any of the key categories and we'll be rolling this out across the site
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:22.800]   over the next couple of weeks, but go to like cell phones, you can find products based on
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:29.840]   specific criteria. If you're looking for an Android phone with LTE on Verizon or a camera
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:37.120]   that takes SD with a Nikon mount, you can get really granular with it. It's pretty awesome.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.640]   This is really sweet. Look at this. One of the things that you've been doing for a while,
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:46.720]   in fact, since we've had you on the last time you've been doing this, is you basically,
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:50.560]   in every category, you say, "These are the top. These are the must-haves."
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.400]   Yeah, those are our picks. And then you have the reviewers picks.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:57.520]   Yeah. And then this is new. I love this. This is really great.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:01.120]   I do remember this from the early, like the beta days.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:08.160]   Yeah. Early on, we let you pick from every spec in the world and it was a nightmare to wade through.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:13.520]   We put a lot of work in like simplifying it, boiling it down and making it just super, super fast.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:18.880]   This is just great. I love gadget and a great job. You got any events, gadget events coming up?
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:25.200]   We are in Boston next, I think, in October, I want to say. It's on events.gagit.com.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.640]   Those are fun too. If you're in the area, you've got to go to those. Those are great.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:31.840]   Doug K has become a professional photographer.
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:34.640]   Well, a full-time photographer.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.720]   An amateur professional photographer.
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:38.480]   Professional full-time amateur.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:39.040]   Yes.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.560]   Oh, the only above.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:41.680]   Where can we see your images?
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:43.200]   I can go to DougK.com.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:47.280]   That's the, if I'm there, you can get to my blog and everything else.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:51.600]   Are you still using smug mugger if you abandon them?
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:52.560]   No, this is smug mug.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.720]   They're like double the cost.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.560]   Yeah, but I've prepaid two years in advance.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:57.440]   Smart man.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:57.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.280]   Smug mug's still a good deal.
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:02.560]   I admire them for biting the bull. The McCaskles are great.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:02.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:08.240]   It's a good company, a good family-run company. They're not doing anything wrong.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:09.280]   Their cost went up.
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.720]   Business goes up. Yeah.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:12.960]   And it's still a cheap deal. I mean, think about it.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.440]   If you wanted to have a storefront, you know, how expensive would that be to have like a real
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:22.480]   commercial store and a mall someplace with an employee.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.960]   And this is like, it's nothing.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:26.320]   Doug, I love your images.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:26.880]   Thank you.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:27.840]   Just great stuff.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.200]   DougK.com to see more.
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:33.120]   I've learned a lot from Trey Ratcliffe, in fact.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:33.120]   Yeah.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.200]   He's one of my inspirations.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:35.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:36.320]   No, thank you.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.920]   There he is. There's Trey Ratcliffe.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.360]   Yeah, it's me in the morning.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.200]   It's me out chopping wood with my axe.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.880]   The stream got just a moment of that, right?
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:50.480]   DougK.com. Trey Ratcliffe is stuck in customs.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:56.000]   Leo Rocks is the offer code if you want to get his new book, which is at FlatBooks.com.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.160]   Right. And many other great authors there too.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:04.320]   We have several great photographers that have written very valuable and interesting books at FlatBooks.com.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:04.960]   How did you get that?
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:05.920]   That's not HDR of that one.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.880]   How did you get that image?
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:08.640]   That is an amazing image.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:15.360]   That's from spending about 12 hours and 1200 shots.
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:17.200]   You just have to wait.
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:17.520]   Wow.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:19.200]   That's right time, right place.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:20.880]   And a camera that shoots 9 frames a second.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.720]   And 400 millimeters.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.720]   Actually, no, that was just probably a 70 to 200.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:27.440]   You were that close.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.320]   Yeah, but it's cropped a lot.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:28.880]   It's cropped.
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:31.520]   Wait, Doug, you went out one time and got that shot?
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:32.480]   No, no, no.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.120]   No, but about 12 hours, 12 hours over four trips.
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:37.680]   Wow.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:39.200]   Four boats.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:40.800]   Because we went out whale watching recently.
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.640]   We didn't see single whale.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.240]   It was like, we were out all day.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:44.960]   No, you can't.
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:45.520]   It's easy.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:46.240]   It happens easily.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:51.360]   No, it takes just, you know, Trey Ratcliffe has taught me you must be present to win.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:55.600]   If you want to get interesting pictures, point your cameras at something interesting.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:56.800]   Who did that originally come from?
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:57.920]   Trey, who is it?
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:58.800]   That's a great one.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:01.280]   That's why Trey, that's one of the reasons he's in New Zealand.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.440]   Because just look what's outside his back door.
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:03.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.800]   Oh.
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.600]   I got a tray.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:07.920]   I got to give you a plug for that time lapse.
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.160]   Oh, that Queenstown time lapse.
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:13.920]   Yeah, that took off on Reddit and really exploded.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.520]   It was a lot of work.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:17.520]   I put about 300 hours into that.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.440]   It's my first time lapse I've ever released.
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:24.160]   It was a--
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:24.640]   Oopsies.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.880]   It was a labor of love.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:28.960]   Let me see if I can--
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:31.680]   30 days and 30 nights in Queenstown.
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:32.720]   Just play a little bit of this.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:39.680]   And I just wonder when you're going to do the same thing in the Peloponnese, Mike Elgin.
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.640]   Oh, and the music on this.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.640]   You got to turn up the-- where'd you get the music for this?
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:44.320]   It's all Hans Zimmer.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:45.440]   Oh, your buddy, Hans.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.360]   Yeah, Hans Zimmer.
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:47.840]   Good guy.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:50.240]   Did he do it just for this?
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.760]   Is it dedicated?
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.880]   No, not just for this.
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:53.440]   This is--
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.640]   Well, he gave you rights.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:56.080]   He gave you rights to do it.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:59.600]   And this was all in the middle of moving and getting set up, right?
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:00.800]   Let's just shut this.
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:05.200]   Yeah, so all these shots are within 15 minutes of my new home there.
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:11.360]   And I would go out with my camera and take photos and find all these amazing,
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.920]   very inspirational landscapes, very moving to me.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:14.560]   Winter camera.
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:15.040]   I'm very--
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:19.680]   And this is a time lapse, obviously, on the D800 or?
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:22.960]   I used D3S for all these shots.
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:25.440]   So this whole video is actually in 4K.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:25.760]   Wow.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.400]   And so you can watch it in mega high revs.
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:29.680]   Where can we see the screen?
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:30.560]   It's all on YouTube.
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:33.680]   Actually, YouTube supports 4K 5K video.
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:37.680]   So, wow, I could go higher quality.
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:39.280]   I need a better computer.
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:41.360]   If you maximum quality, it's all in 4K.
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:41.680]   Wow.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:43.040]   This was--
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.000]   Really beautiful.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.800]   There's a lot of fun.
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:48.480]   It's funny, because the music makes you feel like scary, dramatic.
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:50.400]   If you had happy music, it would be like,
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.680]   Oh, I'm here in Queensland.
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:55.040]   I'm making up with more kind of hubby, happy music.
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.640]   This is where the Hobbit was shot, though, right?
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:56.960]   Yeah.
[02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:57.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:57.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:58.720]   Right here in the green--
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:00.000]   Not the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.800]   But do you see Hobbits around much?
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.280]   No.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:03.280]   No.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.480]   But just my kids.
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:05.280]   OK.
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.000]   Frritos.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:06.960]   I think it's the toes--
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.440]   little furry.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.720]   Yeah, it's a beautiful place down there.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:13.520]   And I feel very dramatic all the time there.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.840]   So I kind of want to capture the drama, but all.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:16.240]   This was--
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.120]   I love this shot.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:17.680]   Isn't that great?
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:18.560]   This reminds me--
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:19.600]   This is one of the greatest--
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:20.720]   Of Koyana Scottsey.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:22.480]   Those are great movies.
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:23.680]   All of those.
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.280]   This was done with Twixter.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.160]   Well, what is going on?
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:26.720]   Because some of the--
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:29.120]   some of there's some little brewing going on.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:29.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:34.800]   So I combined high speed or time-lapse photography
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.640]   using this other tool called Twixter,
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:38.960]   which extrapolates frames in between.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:39.360]   And it guesses--
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.520]   Oh, that's why there's a little bending going on.
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.240]   I get it.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:44.000]   So that's a really neat effect.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.040]   I like that with the traffic.
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:49.040]   Mike, we got to do this in the club scene in the--
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:49.600]   in Sparta.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.200]   Absolutely.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.480]   But I'll have to do it with my iPhone.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:55.120]   And I say, I have a good camera,
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:57.200]   but I just don't have any talent or skill.
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.320]   I know the feeling.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:06:59.440]   I have lots of good camera.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.640]   I have more cameras and skill.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:03.040]   I'm all camera, no cattle.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:06.800]   So before we go, we should find out what's coming up
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.520]   in the week ahead.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.280]   I think we know, but Tom Merritt might have some--
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:11.040]   Say again?
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:12.320]   Kill the audio from your laptop,
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:13.840]   otherwise we're going to hear crazy music
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:14.720]   when we listen to Tom.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:16.080]   Oh, let's not do that.
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:17.040]   So there's like a mix of--
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:18.160]   It'll be like a dramatic--
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:18.720]   Why don't we do some--
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:19.120]   Tom Merritt.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:19.440]   Let's hear.
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:22.000]   Let's just hear Tom Merritt with Hans Zimmer in the background.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:22.800]   Go ahead.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:24.240]   Wait a minute.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:25.520]   Turn Hans Zimmer down.
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:26.400]   It's a little loud there.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.880]   Okay, here we go.
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:29.360]   You ready?
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:29.920]   Wait a minute.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:30.480]   Let me see.
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:31.840]   I'll turn down the level.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:32.400]   Okay, go ahead.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:34.480]   Yep.
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.120]   Tom Merritt.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:36.720]   No, no.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.440]   Hey, thanks.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.040]   I got to turn it up.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:39.760]   Turn up Tom.
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:41.840]   Hi, I'm Tech News today, the week ahead.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.880]   Monday, September 10th.
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.960]   After the weekend, Hackathon is over.
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.680]   TechCrunch disrupt kicks off and runs through Wednesday.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:50.640]   Tuesday, September 11th, the Intel Developers Forum
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:51.840]   takes place in San Francisco.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.800]   For a couple of days.
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:53.920]   Wednesday, September 12th.
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:55.520]   We'll cover that Apple announcement live
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.920]   at 10 a.m. Pacific right here on Twitch.
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.440]   Thursday, September 13th.
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.920]   Nintendo holds a press event where everyone expects
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.840]   to get details on the Wii U.
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:06.320]   Also, it happens to be the day Super Mario Brothers
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:07.920]   launched back in 1985.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.200]   So maybe it's just a big--
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:10.160]   Woo-hoo.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:11.520]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:12.240]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:13.520]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.760]   TNT every weekday, 10 a.m.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:19.440]   Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern Time, 1700 UTC on Twitch.
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.360]   That's your daily dose of Tech News.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.000]   Although Wednesday, TNT starts, I think, at 9, right?
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.080]   So that we can get right into our Apple coverage.
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:26.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.880]   At 10, Tom will be here for that.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:31.040]   Hey, thank you, everybody.
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:32.960]   Mike Elgin, Trey Radcliffe.
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:33.760]   Really nice to see you.
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:35.360]   We're probably not going to see you for a while now, right?
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:36.720]   You're going to go home and that'll be it.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:37.200]   I'll be back.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.840]   I'm doing Google Zeitgeist in October.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.200]   So get back in the area.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.800]   Man, it spends more time.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:44.320]   Hit what you said, your superpower.
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:47.680]   Is-- well, I never get jet lag.
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:50.000]   I just immediately adjust.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.040]   I'd like-- if I could pick any superpower, I'd like another one.
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:54.880]   But that's the one I have.
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:55.680]   God gave you.
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:56.240]   That's so bad.
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:57.760]   So just don't knock it.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:58.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.520]   Thank you, Doug.
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:02.400]   Kay, it's so nice to see you.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:03.520]   I saw a dog in the audience and said,
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:04.640]   "What the hell are you doing back there?
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.600]   Get in front of here."
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.520]   I heard you and Trey were here at the same time.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.320]   I said, "I got to come soon."
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.120]   So nice to see you.
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:09.760]   Come back soon.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:10.160]   Thank you.
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.360]   Same to you, Ryan Block.
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:13.520]   Congratulations and we'll see you on Wednesday.
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:14.880]   Virtually.
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:17.200]   We have to get a Ryan Block puppet,
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:18.400]   if we're really going to do this right.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.240]   I do not-- I do not condone.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:24.880]   And now you have to--
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:26.080]   But the guy boss shot that.
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.640]   Why don't we do the-- what you missed on Twitter right after I wrap things up by saying,
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:31.120]   thank you.
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:32.800]   And by the way, thanks to our studio audience.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.600]   A great bunch of people.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:34.800]   As always, nice to have you.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.920]   We appreciate it.
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.760]   Thanks to you all for watching at home.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.120]   We do Twitch Sundays, 3 p.m.
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:39.920]   Pacific 6 p.m.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:43.360]   Eastern Time 2200 UTC on twitter.tv.
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:48.000]   Watch live because things happen that you will never see in the edited version.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.560]   But of course, if you missed it, you can get the on-demand version,
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.640]   audio and video available at twit.tv.
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:55.520]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:56.240]   Thanks for being here.
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:57.120]   We'll see you next time.
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:57.680]   Another Twitch.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:59.520]   It's under count.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:02.160]   Previously on Twitch, you could call your live.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:04.160]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:04.960]   Oh, there you go.
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:05.520]   Ah.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.720]   Is he-- is-- is lit?
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:07.600]   Wow.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:09.120]   In darkness.
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.000]   They turn off the lights and you can see how well that screen lights up.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.600]   I'll rightly lit it is.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.720]   Ham Nation.
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:20.800]   Thursday morning, the 30th, so the day after landfall of Hurricane Isaac.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:23.440]   KV5 TQG.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.200]   But here's the tree that fell.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.560]   All about Android.
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:28.640]   I was very excited to hear the optimist cheese coming out.
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:29.520]   Could be my next phone.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:32.000]   My contract expires in January.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.520]   This guy's an LG lifer.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:34.400]   I love it.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:35.440]   Gizwiz.
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:35.920]   Look at that.
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:37.120]   We've got a standing desk.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:37.840]   Nice.
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:38.720]   And I'm just going to go--
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:40.240]   and you know, this is kind of good.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:40.720]   I am.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:43.120]   So we're now open the baked beans.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.680]   Just laying on the fresh batteries in there.
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.200]   Oh, I-- I--
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:48.480]   There it goes.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.040]   There it goes.
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.240]   Look it.
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:50.640]   Walking.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:52.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:52.960]   It's feeling good.
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.480]   That's very fun.
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:55.520]   Well, what was that?
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:56.800]   Three minutes from open the--
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:57.840]   Hey, it worked though.
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:10:59.280]   I pad today.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.440]   That's how you're supposed to wear it.
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:03.600]   With the little balls right under--
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:04.400]   anyway.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.680]   If you missed this week on Twitch, you missed a lot.

[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.400]   I'm on a Twitch.
