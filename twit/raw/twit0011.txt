[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in tech, episode number 11 for June 27th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for a Twitcast.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   We were supposed to have some short guy named Chris Parello in here to give us a recap on what happened at Lockernome
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   because it was a big Lockernome.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Microsoft released RSS and it's a big lockernome.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   At Lockernome.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Although it's kind of a non-announcement, isn't it?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Microsoft is saying Internet Explorer 7 in 2006 or maybe early 2007 will support RSS.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Like Mozilla, Firefox, Opera and Safari already do.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Parello was the first person who left on RSS as being the future of publication on the web.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I agree, it's good for Parello.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   But I mean it's like a total vindication of this vision.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And he had Dave Weiner as the opening and Dave's arch rival, Adam Curry as the closing keynote.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And apparently they kissed and made up at Nome Decks.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   That's fine.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So ladies and gentlemen, and I can say ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   for the first time in 11 episodes, 12 if you count the pilot.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I'm sorry, but just again, that's because you haven't seen the picture.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   No, I have.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It is my attempted sarcasm.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Aging VJ kisses Harvard professor.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's not a good image.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Right.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And Chris Parello somehow in the mix in it all.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Why does he always end up like the weird son of all these triads?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So ladies and gentlemen, yes, you're hearing a female voice on the Twitcast for the first time since our pilot.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Jessica Corbin, everybody, I'm so happy to have you here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   This is real.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I am just thrilled.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's by popular demand, I might add.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We tried to keep her out.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You can't keep her out.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You can't keep me out.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   What are you doing?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   No, I started getting all these emails from people, from texting the old days saying that you guys were doing something up to no good.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And so I started to listen and I was like, "Hey, you got something going here?"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's kind of like the old days.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And of course I want in.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm so glad.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Because what you guys started to do was just so often to get real.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And it's so exciting to see what you guys are doing.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And yeah, it's my pleasure.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   What are you doing these days?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   On the tech side of things, still working with CNET, doing a bunch of video on demand for them.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And yeah.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Stick floor.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Stick floor.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Stick floor rocks.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Are you both on the C-floor?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I see him every now and again when he makes an appearance.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So I've been working with them, but then also just been starting at my own venture, which you so eloquently call them.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   No, no.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Don't tell them that.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Don't do it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah, it's called "Fempire."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's short for the female empire, not female vampire, which I'm going to kind of think sometimes.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Are you going to--
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's a friend.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Are you going to ever forgive me for that comment?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Maybe.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We'll see where you can come up with a try to make sure you keep yourself.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Actually, you know what?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I've heard a lot of crap been tossed over the years.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That was pretty much it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Well, we're just really glad to have MB on the show with us today.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's her new nickname, MB, and you can ask her what it stands for.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And I will stand by.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Now, fempire.com is kind of up, but you're going to do more on there, right?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yeah, it's a placeholder right now, just kind of showcasing what we're going to be doing and our fledgling apparel line.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   So, yeah, fempire.com is where it's at right now, but it should in the next couple months we should have the whole online magazine up.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Any plans to return to television?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah, dude.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm going to be doing a show I think for we called "Ling Woman" because you guys know you don't need a wingman.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You need a wing woman when you're trying to get a date.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You need a check with the buyer with you to kind of tell you what's up.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So, that's going to be kind of the new calling.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Well, that's kind of cool.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So, you'll go with guys who are going out in dates and you'll whisper in their ear what to tell them what to do and stuff like that.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I'm your wing woman, David.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I like that idea.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   But does the person who are meeting find that kind of odd?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Well, here's just a tip for you guys.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Anytime that you're wrong with a girl, girls are more likely to look at you.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So, yes, in a way it might put them off a little bit at first, but they're going to be looking at you and I think it's going to actually work in your benefit.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So, what you're saying is that "petitive evil" thing, right?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah, it's kind of a primal thing, I think.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Wow, so you're saying basically men are more attractive when they have a woman inside them than if they're alone?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Roger.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Okay, can't just be any woman.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Take notes, Roger.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   But if you go with a certain, yeah, I would say it does help your game.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Because if you're rolling solo and you approach a woman, they're automatically going to think that you're trying to jock them, but wouldn't you with another woman?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You know, you don't necessarily know.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So, it kind of throws a lady off.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You know, they don't know what your motives are.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And so, they're more likely to let you in, opposed to just being the single guy approaching a girl.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You know, you know what he's after.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And sometimes you can meet that with a little bit of harm.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   If I had brought Jessica Corbin on my first date with Jennifer, I would not be married today.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I didn't.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Well, I'm happy I didn't go.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You can't show up with this beautiful woman on your arm and say, "Hey, this is my wing woman."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Hi, I'm out of here.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Please, please, please, please introduce me as sludge.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I'm Jessica.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I'm Jessica.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   That's even worse.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Well, you don't show a woman.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's one thing.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I mean, it's one thing what Jessica is saying is like, if you're with a group of women and you're going out to a bar, you're out to a club, that basically you get some sort of credit from the other women in the room because...
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   That I understand.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   They look at...
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Don't show up for your first big date with a woman trailing alongside you.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   But that's what she's going to do.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   No, I'm kind of like, imagine it being like, "I'm there with you in the first stage now."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Second stage comes off and you've got the number.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I'm not going with you.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I'm going to get on the damn date.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I'm not.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But I am going to be watching so I can give you...
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I can critique you.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Well, I have to say, had I shown up for my first date with Jennifer with a camera crew sound man producer, that probably wouldn't have gone over too good either.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So, it's all...
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Let's get to the tech.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Although, as far as this is, in fact, it's time for the Atlantic to say, "Let's not do a tech show anymore.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Let's talk dating, ladies and gentlemen."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But it's time.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   In relationship!
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   In relationship!
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Does "Fempire Sell Bumper" stickers?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Yes, thank you.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I think you have one.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I think I slapped your forehead to left.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   No, I saw one at Barney's, Beenerie, and West Hollywood in one of the booths.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I thought, "Oh my God, Fempire."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Prager and join the movement.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That's all I have.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   You know, I'm sorry, I hate to say it, but it sounds like a feminine hygiene product.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's totally not!
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   You're supposed to say that sounds hot and sexy, and I want to know more.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's not a feminine hygiene product.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It sounds like summer's...
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Even though you could use your bumper stickers and whatever.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Stop, stop, stop.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Both of you.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Stop right now.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It sounds like summer's Eve the new "Be With Bacon" flavor.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I just...
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   It's not...
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I'm gonna do a Fempire on you, Leah.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   You better be careful.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I got the Twitter army behind me.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Okay, I'm gonna do an excuse.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Guys, where'd they go?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   They were here.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Guys?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Oh, they've all gone over to the Fempire.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Remember that?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Return your money off or you may a couple years ago?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   You know, we got our first charge back on PayPal.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Get this.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Somebody donates.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I mean, oh, this is free.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Look, this podcast is free.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Somebody donates, I think it was 20 bucks.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And then, calls their credit card company and says, "I didn't get the merchandise I bought."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And cancels.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And then there's an investigation.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The credit card company calls PayPal and PayPal says, "Well, did we go to charge back?"
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   So I just run them a note saying, "Pfft, dude, you didn't have to ask your credit card company.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I want to give you the money back.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   What are you talking about?"
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Maybe it wasn't, you know, hit my or her.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Maybe it was their spouse or their parents.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Oh, they thought it was a porno thing.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   We didn't get to it.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We didn't get to it.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We didn't get our merch in the...
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Yeah, to it.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's a...
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   The Fempire.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That's different.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Stop it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Okay.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Story number one, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.680]   It's the 800 GTX this week, which shockingly enough, the product actually shipped the night
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680]   of the announcement.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   Wow.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   And large...
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   Basically, we have three shops, the night of the announcement, and pretty much everywhere.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   How much is it?
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.120]   Heh, heh, heh, Herod, where are you?
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.120]   It's like 600 bucks, I think, for this thing.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   Like 550 to 600 bucks.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   For a video.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   What?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   Shipped?
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   You remember the 7--
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.480]   $500 is typical tie-in price for a brand new card.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.680]   I think this one's 600, though.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   It's more than that, even.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   Well, that's more than an e-machine.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   Okay, take a deep breath.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   I own two e-machines, and I know what I'm getting, and it's no 7--
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   It's no 7--
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.600]   But that price has been there for a while, and that at $500, $600 price point for the
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.320]   very best cards as soon as they come out.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   Is it better?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.920]   Is Nvidia eating ATI's lunch?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   Temporary.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   No.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.960]   Well, it's amazing to look at the benchmark numbers that people are throwing out, and
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.800]   like a 7800, especially Nvidia's thrown out, like a 7800 is the equivalent performance
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.840]   of two of our former fastest card, and that's the lie mode.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.760]   Is this funny how this goes back and forth?
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.840]   You know, like a couple of years ago, the script was, Nvidia's dead ATI has finally
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.520]   beat him, and the X800, and now it's gone the other way.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.040]   It really is a seesaw, isn't it?
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   It always is.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   It's been for the first four years.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   It was like, first, Matrox got three, or like--
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.840]   Yeah, whatever happened to them.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.040]   More of Matrox, they're still making high-end video products up in Canada, but they're pretty
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.280]   much out of the 3D race.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   It's really ATI.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   Two horse races.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.280]   Well, I mean, who should upgrade--
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.280]   For desktop 3D, yeah.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.480]   Who should-- I mean, should anybody upgrade to a 7800 GTX?
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.280]   Sure, if you're building a brand-new system right now, you should-- if you're spending,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.760]   you know, over $500 for a CPU, you should be spending over $500 for a video card if you
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.320]   want to match them well.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.880]   So say Robert, and so it shall be--
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   And the-- with a chorler, that would be that-- look, if you're going to spend $500 on a
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.360]   video card, you better already have a CPU that's top of the line.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.760]   They can't push that GPU as fast as possible.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.800]   And Jessica, this is why we can't get dates.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.120]   I'm sitting back just trying to visualize--
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.200]   If you were the wingwoman at this point, what would you advise Roger to do?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.280]   Let's say you're Roger's wingwoman here.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.920]   Change the subject.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920]   Change the subject.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.720]   How about you change the subject to that?
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.320]   What should he change the subject to a wingwoman?
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:17.000]   If I was in the situation and Roger was talking about cards, sound cards, graphic cards, I
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.200]   would tell him, you know, related to the woman.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.640]   How is this going to affect the woman in some way?
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.800]   It's just going to affect her.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.640]   You know how hot the virtual woman I could create with the video card?
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.000]   No, that's not what she's talking about.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We're back in the virtual.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   We're not back in the reality.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah, we're going real.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   No, no, no.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Okay.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.400]   You know, one of these could put the down payment on a diamond ring that--
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.360]   So you say, this is how you wrap it back in.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.840]   I'm not going to get the new card.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.600]   And instead, I'm going to get you a new Tiffany.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.440]   That's how those two things are going to be.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.920]   I would love to buy the $600 video card, but honey, because you matter so much.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.040]   You know, there's a really great line from Firefly, the Joss Whedon series, to go, honey,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.360]   remember that sex we were ever going to have again?
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   You know what?
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   So did you get me that whole series.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:12.560]   I don't want guys to stop the geek talk, because anytime that you talk passionately about
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   something, it's a passion.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.400]   So there is something for you guys right there.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.000]   If you're passionate about this, you talk about it with passion.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.360]   But every now and again, you've got to kind of bring it back down and relate it.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   That's pretty rare, Jess.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.280]   I tend to just listen and then repeat.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.120]   Did you know I can get frame rates over 100 frames a second in--
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.120]   Yes, and then I can get you anywhere.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.120]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   You can describe it.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.720]   You just don't even go there.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   I'm not-- I'm talking about your gang.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   That's for your body.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.520]   1600 by 1200, baby.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   Nothing.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.520]   Soup.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   I have nothing.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   Passion in the right area.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   Item two.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   Passion in the right area.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   Let's get sad.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.800]   Jack Kilby has passed away.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.400]   The inventor of the microprocessor?
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.200]   Ten points for Mr. Prager.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   Yay.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   Yay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   He's 51 years old.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.800]   He got a Nobel Prize for it.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.200]   OK, item three.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   That was--
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   I mean, it was--
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   It moved right along there.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.120]   It's kind of funny that, I mean, was that even made like a super big deal like if someone
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.440]   like the inventor of the automobile, I mean, grandiore passed away from me hundreds of years
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.480]   ago, but if he died recently, we'll take more people to take notes, but it's not all.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.720]   A hundred years ago, give or take.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.160]   I'm sure when Orville and Wilbur passed on, there was, you know, a big national ceremony.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.040]   And we should point out the story where we found this on was an MSNBC story.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   So I feel like it was--
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   Wasn't it?
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.200]   Has this even shown up on slash time?
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.560]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.080]   But I mean, it isn't-- the front page news probably ought to be.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.760]   I mean, this guy changed the world, don't you think?
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.120]   I mean, considering cell phones, your ATM machine, you know, pizza, everything.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.160]   You know, you know, famier without Jack Kilby.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   Stop it.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.120]   There'd be no, you know, pharas Hilton, you know--
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.120]   That's right.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   Where would you--
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   Where would the license--
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   You never had a sidekick.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   That's right.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   I mean, it's pretty amazing to realize it was--
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.440]   At least, with an integrated circuit, though, I mean, if it hadn't been for him.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.240]   You think somebody else would have not?
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   Well, don't eat--
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.880]   The guy, I mean, it's an interesting thought.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.000]   There were people working on it, but he was 1958.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.080]   He was fresh out of college.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.960]   And-- or at least, I don't know if he was fresh out of college, but it was first year
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.200]   working at TI, and they basically let him work on this.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   That's neat.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.840]   Miniaturization full time.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   That's pretty cool.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   You know.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   But you're right.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.640]   If somebody else probably at TI would have done this work--
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.120]   It's an interesting thought.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.000]   He-- he's the one who put it together for better or for worse.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.320]   And do they call it the Kilby?
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   I mean, it isn't--
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   No.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.960]   He doesn't even have a hamburger named after him at Barney's beanery.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.160]   Well, he probably all--
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   --find away all his patent rights, too.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.800]   That's probably true to you to make any money out of either.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   Mm.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   Mm.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   Okay.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   That's kind of-- that's kind of sad this way.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.760]   Was he part of the military effort during the war, World War II, for code breaking and
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.760]   things like that?
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.760]   He would have to--
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   She'd just read up on the guy.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.840]   For more on Jack Kilby, visit your local library.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   Thanks, kids.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   On Google.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.840]   Wikipedia.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   Wikipedia.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.440]   Yeah, but it is really interesting to think about how our lives would be changed, had he
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   not.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.200]   But the thing is, it's probably a collaborative effort.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   So even though he got kind of the notoriety for it, the chances are it was another--
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.040]   Probably fame for notoriety.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.560]   You know, I mean, remember who was it?
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.400]   Neil Stevenson wrote the Steam Age?
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.720]   The Diamond Age.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   The theory being that the computer was steam-driven and how that would have changed the world.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   That was Gibson.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   Gibson.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   Bruce Sterling.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   Bruce Sterling, that's right.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   I mean, it's kind of fun.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.080]   Kind of the heart of speculative fiction is thoughts like that.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.480]   What if that had never happened?
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.280]   Was that "Flightened Doors"?
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   "Slightened Doors"?
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.280]   Oh, there's that.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   Pardon me, Roger?
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   Oh, no.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.760]   I was thinking back to that anime's "T-Boy."
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.440]   That's kind of-- but it's on the whole premise of the "Turing Age."
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.120]   And he has just one device, it's steam power, but it's super powerful.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.520]   Like, it's a scientific humanity.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.920]   And he has controlled it.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.400]   Someday David Burns is going to make a song out of Roger Chang's "Twit Comments."
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   I don't even understand.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   No.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.640]   Not only is it digitized, but it doesn't make any sense.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   It's like, you know...
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.720]   He's a silon, but worse.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   He's a silon.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   Resistance is...
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   It's a division.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   I talk just as a clear-out.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   It...
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   It...
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   It's a...
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.560]   Oh, hey, on "Killby."
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.960]   He's noted as being the patenting inventor of the portable calculator and the thermal printer.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   There you go.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   Wow.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   Hey, the thermal printer.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.040]   I'm going to remember that.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.920]   Okay, let's move it along.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   We only have an hour.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   Shall we?
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   Maybe two hours.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.160]   It's kind of a lot of ground so far.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.960]   Thanks to our wingwoman.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.720]   Prager, what's the story of Sunnyvale getting its lights hacked?
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.200]   I left this story.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.560]   I don't know anything about that.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   I heard it out at this time.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.720]   No, I heard you did it.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.720]   You didn't do it?
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   Wasn't it for G4?
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.400]   Oh, no, I'm kidding.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.960]   Just teasing.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.480]   There is going to be something coming out on, I believe it's called "From the Shadows"
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.480]   about traffic lights in their next little box.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   So, yes, you did it.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   Well, there's the rejection.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.760]   Then, the thing in Sunnyvale, somebody's basically been hacking the traffic light boxes in Sunnyvale
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.920]   and setting them up so like all directions blink red simultaneously at once.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920]   I love it.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.920]   I love it.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.520]   So, basically shutting down traffic in Sunnyvale and the...
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.000]   I think it's a good hack.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.640]   What a lot of people don't know is that there's boxes, they put in ambulances.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   There's boxes you can get access to that will trick, that will trip certain lights to
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.520]   change them from red to green.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.360]   I know, I always wanted one of those buses to have them too.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   It'd be so cool because you just...
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   I don't know if the buses have them.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.360]   Oh, yeah, they do.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   Sometimes some cities where they...
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.860]   They just run the red lights and...
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.860]   They don't care.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.860]   Right, yeah.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.960]   So, only if a bus has to stop for a red light would that make a difference.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   I think it's...
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   You know, it's not a high tech hack.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.480]   I mean, the guy probably has a key to the box and is able to wire it.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.960]   I just think it's kind of funny.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.640]   Nobody's died yet, but it's funny because this happened in the heart of Silicon Valley.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.440]   You know, the hackers live everywhere.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.040]   Has the guy been caught?
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   No.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   Or is this like a...
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.360]   No, and actually the tech angle is that the police are asking people to put down their
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   cell phones and pay attention.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.080]   Nobody's noticed this guy doing it.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.640]   And if you're going to use your cell phone, use your camera to snap a picture of them
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   doing it.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.240]   They've nobody's seen him do it.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   When's he doing this?
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   No, it's just a...
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.080]   This might be a boy versus girl thing.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.040]   Like do all guys kind of have the ambition to be able to do something like that?
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   Just an incredibly girl.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.440]   Girls aren't like, I want to go out there and hack into that and...
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   My daughter does.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   With people's...
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   Does she?
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440]   Yeah, it might be generational.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   Maybe it's just personality, maybe it's genetic.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   I don't know.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   I would.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440]   I would.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.240]   And my daughter keeps saying, "Daddy, what's your password?
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   What's the root password?"
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   What's the root password?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.120]   I think it might be daddy's password.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.880]   I think your daddy had passwords?
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   God, you're so young.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.040]   Forbidding knowledge.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.320]   Alright, daddy didn't have passwords.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.480]   My daddy was lucky if he had a safe deposit box.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Passwords.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.720]   When did passwords enter our life?
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.000]   I remember using them on BBS's...
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.720]   And non-18M versions.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.480]   1985, I have my first ATM card.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.560]   It's part of our lives now.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   We all have hundreds of passwords.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.920]   20 years ago you didn't have a password.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.480]   How many passwords do you guys use?
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.040]   You guys use the same password over and over and over again?
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.840]   Or do you guys have tons?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.400]   I try to change mine, you're late.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   My master password.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Oh, you have a master password?
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.600]   I forget my password.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.200]   I have a medium high and low security password.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   Yeah, I have password.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.000]   I use the same thing over and over.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Okay.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.800]   Because the minute I use a different password, I can't log in.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   I keep having to ask Skype, "What's my password?"
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.080]   Because I never remember it.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.040]   I actually use the same theme for everything.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.960]   So it's all a variation on the same.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.280]   Do you want to share this theme with us?
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.480]   Or is it something you probably don't?
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.600]   I'll tell you about all you're not.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.120]   It's all pies.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.080]   Different flavors of pie.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   Right?
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.880]   I'm hungry now.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   Pie.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.920]   Do we have any other stories, Patrick?
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   You've got to keep moving here.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.120]   Patrick's going to be doing this on his own in the next couple of weeks ago.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.920]   Can I tell you something about that?
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   Yes.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.520]   Did you guys read about the PlayStation thumbs?
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   You read about it.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.040]   It's a 13-year-old girl, the first published case in a medical journal.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.320]   Symptoms including blisters, numbness and tingling.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.800]   Oh, you know what?
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   First case published in a medical journal.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   This is the first case?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.120]   God, I've been hearing about Nintendo thumb for a long time.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.920]   Oh, this is the first PlayStation thumb.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920]   Is there an Xbox thumb?
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   You know what's interesting is I think a couple of years ago there were some British
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.000]   medical doctors who were saying that there was...
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   There should be some concern about...
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Crotron.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Operation controllers?
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Oh.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.800]   Because they found this one.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.600]   This one was playing like this PlayStation like eight hours a day.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.480]   The vibration he was actually getting early arthritis.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   Prior to his high-gen issues.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   Because don't we all...
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.200]   I mean, if you use a console, they all have rumble packs now, right?
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   Doesn't that kind of standard?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   Pretty much.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.480]   And they were just like, you got to take that in moderation because you're going to...
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.040]   Because those British doctors, they pay attention.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.760]   Because what I thought you were going to talk about was the laptop, the overheating the
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   laptop, the laptop.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:40.520]   That was also in the lancet or whatever the journal of American British.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.160]   The tomfoolery is...
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   Medical stuff.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:49.600]   They say that this PlayStation thumb is becoming very common in children.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   Very common.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Oh, I'm sure it is.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.960]   Instead of like skinned knees, which I'm sure...
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   Oh, that's sad, isn't it?
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   You know, it's not a major.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   It's now PlayStation thumb.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.560]   I'm waiting for an entire generation of kids who are super nearsighted because all they
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.320]   do is to wash a monitor, flash, sprites, and a basic light age.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.760]   That whole nearsighted television thing is who we...
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   Who's...
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   Have you had it, LASIK?
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.760]   Anybody?
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.960]   Oh, I went to the process for them and get the actual...
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   Zapper flap.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   Remember.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   Flappin' Zapper.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   They said your eyes were so bad they couldn't do it.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   No, they couldn't do it.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.360]   And mines would just take a year.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.040]   It served like the day.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.040]   They would do it, they would do it, and then I'd show them six months later to...
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   They'd do some more.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.600]   They'd do some more because they would only do half lit.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.160]   And then they would make sure that the eye wasn't trying to regrow or redo something with
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   my eye and that period where they had to lay his off a little more.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.840]   So it wouldn't be one of those people that would throw off their glasses at the end of
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.200]   the operation, say I'm free.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.720]   I think he was gonna pay for that.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   They were?
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   Remember.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.760]   Because we were gonna fake, we were gonna film it.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   That's right.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   We were gonna tape it.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.720]   Put my eye wall in a little laser and blazed away.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   Wow.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   That's sad.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   Good head, perfect vision.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.080]   Or at least better vision.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.000]   But it would have taken a year and we weren't gonna be around in a year so they just said
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   no.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.840]   Actually the real reason they canned it was because Roger would be like, "Hey, how do
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   you like your new eyesight?"
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.000]   Roger would be like, "It's a game team."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.320]   Actually, you know the real reason is everyone likes new glasses and then they call them
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   it.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.920]   Roger doesn't wear glasses anymore but it's not Roger.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.840]   I find, I find the minute I started wearing glasses people found me more approachable.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   Strangers on the street especially.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   It was just like, yeah.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   Really?
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   Out of nowhere.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840]   Interesting.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.840]   You need a wing woman.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   That's awesome.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   That's awesome.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.840]   You're hot.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.840]   Wing woman says glasses are hot.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.840]   Really?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.280]   As long as you're the right friend's heck yeah.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   What kind of frames?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   Just not that I care.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.640]   We'll go eye glass shower.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   I got Nike.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.840]   I got these Nike wire frames.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   Nope.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   Can you say Oakley's?
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   Like the old school 80s Oakley's?
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   Oakley's?
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   Oakley's.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   Oakley's.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   These are actually, these are very...
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   They're not aviators.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.640]   No, they're actually, they're kind of steel frames.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   Very subtle.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   They actually follow the osu!
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   That's good.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.840]   Did somebody turn on a motor?
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.840]   Something.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.640]   Yeah, I hear that too.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   What the heck is that?
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   I think it's my fan.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.240]   Wait till you see the horrible, horrible frames that Martin Sargent has.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   Oh my God.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   We got to get Martin on the show.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   What's he up to now?
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.480]   I'm a lot of barbecues.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   He's...
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   Oh, they're the fan?
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   They're the one.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   They're the one.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   He's just went off.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.640]   So really, is he looking for work in television or has he found a job as a party?
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.320]   Yeah, I just saw him.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.480]   I saw him last night and now he's got his manager and his agent in there.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   He's auditioning all over the place.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.800]   They keep telling him that he nails these auditions and I don't know.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.920]   Just still moving, still going and looking for...
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   It's tough.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.920]   The next big gig.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   It's tough.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.920]   It is.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.920]   It's so hard.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:58.840]   It's just the right time, right place, right look, right shoe size, whatever it is, it's
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   just hit or miss.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.720]   That's why I just stay here in my little attic in Petaluma and I don't talk to anybody.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.280]   You're a man-pire in your own way.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   I'm a man-pire.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280]   I'm a vampire.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   You're your own man-pire.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.080]   I don't think see, man-pire as a work.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.320]   Man-pire sounds like I'm on fire like they're burning me where you have a man-pire.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Somebody sent me a...
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.320]   Discovery.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   Okay, I got a...
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.120]   This is the kind of crap I get offers for.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:32.400]   Some British company that's producing probably for $12, a chauffeur discovery on science.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.040]   And then they say, "Can you come to LA?"
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.840]   And I said, "No, I'm in Petaluma in my attic.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.560]   If you want to come to my attic, I'll talk to you."
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   And they don't.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   And then they don't.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.200]   So that's my career right there in that shell.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.400]   But it's nice here in the attic.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   There you are.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.920]   Oh, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   It's Chris Locker-Nome-Parello.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   The women.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.240]   Now, hold on a second.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.280]   You know, because you got a big question mark next to you.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.560]   And by the way, I don't know if I really like this icon, Chris.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   It's your chest.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.360]   Oh, well, that's a, you know, it's the easy way of identifying me on the street.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   Okay, Chris.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   Hold on a second.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   I'm going to put him on a hold.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   Turn your volume down.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   Patrick's going to work with you on your microphone.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.400]   I have to put you on hold because everybody else is going, "What the heck happened?"
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   Just hang on.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   Hold on a second.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   Just turn it down a little bit.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.640]   And I'm going to resume the conference.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:25.080]   Hey, guys, hold on because I know he disappeared, but hang on for a second because the Locker
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.560]   Nome has appeared.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.840]   So Roger, I'm going to bump you off here because you're the lowest quality, okay?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.480]   It's great talking to you.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.200]   Nothing personal, Roger.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.000]   Go call your girlfriend.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Okay.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Digital arc.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   There he goes.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.440]   And now I'm going to add, ladies and gentlemen, Chris Parello's chest to the...
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.960]   What is it?
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.200]   Rentmychess.com, right?
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   He's got...
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   I love RSS.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.680]   I heart RSS.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.760]   And then underneath the little orange XML logo on there.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.920]   And I just painted a...
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.240]   Well, Ponzi, my fiancé, just painted a big blue E on my chest for the announcement that
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.040]   was made at Nome Decks this week.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.920]   We were talking about that, but let me just first introduce everybody to you.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.280]   Chris, you're talking with Leo LaPorte, of course.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.200]   Patrick Norton, David Prager.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.240]   I'm sure you remember from Tech TV.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.000]   Robert Herron, also from Tech TV, and Jessica Corbin.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.520]   The names sound familiar, but I'm not sure where to place them.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.760]   It's been a long time.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.440]   So congratulations, by the way.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   We were just talking about the fact that Microsoft chose your conference to announce
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.760]   this new RSS capability in Longhorn.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.480]   I was pretty happy about it.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   We weren't sure what was going to happen with it.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.280]   And certainly, you know, not to play favorites, I've been trying to get a hold of Apple for
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.880]   years to get them involved with the conference, but if you have to receive anything back from
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.400]   them, and finally, Microsoft really made this particular year, fifth year, a breakthrough.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.320]   We're still at the top of Google News, Technerati.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.720]   Had major press mentions, total blog coverage.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.120]   It's been an amazing, amazing weekend for me.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.520]   You had, and I mentioned you had Dave Weiner and Adam Curry, which is...
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.080]   Now, when you booked them, you knew that they were kind of at each other's throats, right?
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   Oh, certainly.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   You wanted them.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   Sure.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   But you did book them at opposite ends of the conference.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   Well, I...
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.440]   First of all, I'd asked Adam Curry, and he did it hands down.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.840]   It wasn't even a question for him as he had tuned into the last Nome Decks when we streamed
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:30.320]   it online and really enjoyed it from a hotel I believe in London at the time.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:37.080]   So I basically lined him up first, and then when I had heard a podcast done between Dave
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:44.120]   Weiner, Steve Rubell, and I believe the guy from hackingnetflix.com, and they had asked
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.240]   Dave if he was going to come to Nome Decks, and I was like, "You know what?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.280]   It would be tremendous if we had Dave as our second keynote."
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   Very cool.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.160]   And it worked out very, very well.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.320]   But he's the second keynote, but he goes first.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.120]   I like putting my...
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.360]   As you remember, Leo, I like putting my keynotes.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.240]   Since we had two this year, I was able to kind of bookend them.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.720]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.960]   And so that we get a good start and we get a good finish.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.640]   And it worked out very, very well for that reason.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.240]   And they kissed and made up at locker now.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.480]   Yeah, it was kind of...
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.640]   It was very eerie.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.480]   I think people were disappointed.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.240]   Jessica called it hot.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.600]   And you stop it.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   She's very hot.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.760]   Well, there was a little tongue action going on, but I don't think anybody caught that
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.160]   on film, so...
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160]   Right.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:38.760]   That's okay, someone caught Matt Mowinweg from WordPress, the open source CMS, wearing
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.920]   a movable type hat.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   Someone threw it on it as a joke and someone happened to snap a picture before he was able
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   to yank it off.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.160]   But there isn't this big rivalry going on.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.000]   I mean, we're all kind of getting together, right?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.480]   I mean, this is small enough that it's not like we're at each other's throats.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   It's funny.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   You use Vibe.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   So...
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.920]   Can you guys kick me real quick through what the rivalry is about?
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   Which one?
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.720]   Without him, Curry.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   What is this rivalry?
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.320]   Yeah, what's the story, Chris?
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.880]   Well, I only know it as an outsider as most people do, except if you were Adam or Dave.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.040]   And I think it just has to do with two very, very strong technologists with slightly different
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   ideas.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.160]   And they're definitely going in the same direction.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.240]   They're both really...
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.680]   Can both take credit for podcasting?
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   Oh, certainly.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.440]   Without either one of them, it wouldn't be what it is today.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   Exactly.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.920]   But they seem to have some disagreements over who should get more credit for that.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.080]   I think that's kind of where the bottom line is, isn't it?
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   Okay.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.600]   Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.640]   I think Dave has been...
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:48.240]   Well, I thought it was extremely rude when he was written out of the Wikipedia entry
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   for podcasting.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   I think that was...
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   It just shows...
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   I don't know.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   But who would do...
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   I mean, some kid did that.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   I mean, who knows?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   No.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   I wouldn't get a party nation.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.840]   No, I wouldn't say necessarily a curry supporters.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.920]   But they're just some people who don't quite understand Dave.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.080]   And I don't think anyone understands Dave, myself included.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.920]   He can get on people's nerves.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.080]   He's got strong opinions and he's very direct.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.800]   And not ashamed or afraid to say him.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.080]   So one of the things that people noted was that they...
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.840]   Microsoft said support for RSS, not for "Athem."
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.920]   Do you think that that's significant or is that just...
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.080]   Does Microsoft mean RSS and everything else around?
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   Yes.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.520]   They're using RSS as the umbrella term.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:41.680]   And largely because when it boils down to it, there have been very few examples on how
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.920]   "Athem" is significantly better than RSS.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:50.800]   Certainly, you could do things similar to what you can do with RSS with "Athem."
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.960]   But we've yet to see any practical applications of the "Athem" format over RSS.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.040]   You might remember, I've been championing this for years.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.920]   I was still at Tech TV when I was a huge fan of RSS.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   I'll never forget you coming running in and saying, "Look what you're doing!
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.680]   Look at the keys on my left face!
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.720]   You were showing me Gator, I think.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.160]   Yeah, I think I'm going to be on the face!
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   That was before scope.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.160]   It was a while ago.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.160]   Calm down.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   Cut down that coffee.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.720]   That was before I had quick coffee.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.640]   I'm completely off the juice now.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   You know what?
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   I have to say, Chris, that's important.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.320]   In all seriousness, you sound really much more relaxed.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.480]   Maybe you just tired after a long walk.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.480]   That could be it too.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.680]   But when did "The Walking Home" end yesterday?
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.960]   It wrapped up yesterday.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.360]   We started Thursday night with a party as we usually do to get people kind of warmed
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   up.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.560]   And then this Saturday, well Friday happened.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.560]   When I told the conference center that we had over 300 people coming, because I had
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:55.080]   sold out the conference at 300 and we added another 100 who wanted to come just because
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   they wanted to be there and we didn't want to shut the door on them.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.360]   We totally tapped out their network.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.160]   I mean, they just were not expecting what they got.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.120]   So they added a second T1 by the second day.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.840]   It was slow, but it was manageable on Saturday.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.440]   That's one of the fun things about Atlok are now.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.320]   Every single person in the auditorium is blogging.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   No, no, no.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.400]   Leo, I could not.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.960]   I believe more laptops than people there this year.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.680]   And I guess now it's not blogging.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.320]   That was when I was there a few years ago.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.080]   Now it's probably audio blogging, right?
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   They're all podcasting.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.000]   We had, I mean, people were recording the ambience, you know, noise, room, and reactions.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.680]   No, it's like a bad DVD where you could see locker number from 47 different angles.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   Oh, God.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   Jeez.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.200]   Don't they do that just in pornos?
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   I think it's porno.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.520]   Yeah, it's like it's porn you're doing right here.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   Not that I would know.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   No, of course not.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   So hey, you're doing some.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   Let's finish up locking them.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.960]   Then I want to talk about the new podcast, but any other big announcements in locking
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.840]   them, I know the RSS took all the attention, but surely there were other things people
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.240]   were talking about.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.880]   Well, it by the way, it's gnome decks, but it's good that you know locker know as well.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   You're not the only one.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   It's great.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   It's actually great branding.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.040]   I may have to explain that at another time, but Chris is the locker gnome.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.800]   The convention is gnome decks.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   Yes.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.440]   But they're kind of one and the same.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.080]   I was calling CES Com Decks the entire Twit number eight.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   So people are used to that.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   That's just me.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   That's good.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.880]   No, we had a couple of other minor things kind of announced.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.840]   We had Steve Rubell, who is the big PR blogger, had actually convinced Weatherbug to do a
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.280]   few things, including opening up their APIs and adding RSS feeds and doing a couple of
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   other neat things.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.000]   But the audience really didn't react too kindly to it.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.240]   I give when I invite someone to speak, and as I say, you know this well, I really don't
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   give anybody a topic.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.960]   I just say, this is your time slot.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.400]   You can pretty much do with it what you wish.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:04.040]   So the only responsibility I claim for anything that may go awry is having had gnome decks,
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   that's it.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.840]   The audience kind of reacted negatively because they felt it was more of a marketing pitch
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   than anything else.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.400]   Well, it's not the same Steve Rubell.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.520]   It started Studio 54 and went to jail.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   No.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   Okay.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   In possession, is it?
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   No.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.520]   No, no, no.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.520]   This is a micro-persuasion.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520]   You know, I'm going to get soup for libel.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   I don't even know.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.720]   That's how I forget I even said that.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   I'll just say.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   It's okay.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   You can edit this out.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.200]   I hope I can edit it out.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.120]   We're trying to do this thing live to tape.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   Good luck.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.840]   No, we had a couple of other minor things.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.160]   People who announced new updates and new websites around the conference, but not necessarily
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.360]   at the conference.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:51.960]   Since we're kind of the un-conference, most sponsors pay for speaking slots, but we don't
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.640]   take that approach to things.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.960]   Yes, we take sponsors, but that just because you pay doesn't mean you're guaranteed X, Y,
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   and Z.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.640]   We really make it for the attendees and that really makes it.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:09.160]   I think an emotionally charged event, and that seems to be what I walked away with from
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.720]   it this year, including a few revelations that have already trickled into my personal
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   blog.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.000]   Oh, did you get engaged?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.160]   No, I was engaged, although I should be getting married at some point.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.200]   I don't know the date yet.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   I know that.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   But no, I decided to remove about 95% of the ads that were running on my personal blog
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.520]   and I'm going to try to structure what I do there just a little differently than I had
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   in the past.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.240]   And this is not direct feedback from anybody else, but it was just kind of an epiphany that
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.080]   I had when I had dinner with my parents, my fiance Ponzi, and business partner.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.120]   She's pretty much 50/50 with me.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.880]   And Adam Curry, Steve Gilmore, Dave Weiner, we're all sitting around at the table with
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.720]   a few of my people who write for locker room.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.960]   And just the discussion just really made me think very hard about it.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   They said lose the ads, man.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   Lose the ads.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   They didn't say that.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.440]   They didn't say that.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   And Steve Gilmore, of course, blogs over at ZD.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.720]   And of course their ads there.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.800]   But it's something that Dave had said that really kind of gave me pause.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.640]   They were really happy that Noam Decks was something that no one else could seem to pull
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.520]   off, but that personal touch really made all the difference.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.040]   Yeah, no, I think that's really true.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.560]   Hey, tell us about the Chris Perilow show.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.120]   But there really isn't nobody in podcasting is doing it.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.000]   You're doing it live with live phone calls.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.160]   Yeah, I had to do that.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.920]   Well, it's the real day all.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.160]   I had announced it at the last Noam Decks when podcasting was starting to get talked about
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.480]   and hadn't really put all the details together.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.120]   But I pretty much said I want to do this anyway.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.840]   And then the podcasting thing, and I'm like, oh, this is great.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.720]   Even though I still don't like the word as much as I think people who own iPods do,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.960]   I basically have a live radio show without a radio station.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:10.600]   And we take that, we carve it up MP3WMA and let people download it.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.480]   And it's going like gangbuds.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   How many people?
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.440]   The problem with streaming, I mean, this is why podcasting or even just downloading
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.280]   internet audio is more popular.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   There's a problem with streaming is it's hard to have a lot of people listening at
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.600]   the same time and it takes time to stand with.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.360]   We've got a partner with Limelight Networks and they streamed the Noam Decks conference
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.000]   for us as well.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   The highest number?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.080]   How many streams are you setting up?
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.240]   I think, well, with the Chris Perilio Show, it depends on the topic.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.440]   Like the first show we did with Robert Scobel ended up going 8,000 streams.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.520]   And the Noam Decks, this is the only real number I had.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.560]   In the morning we had 3,000 people tuning in before there was anything streaming.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.520]   So I think it went up from there.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   I can only see them.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   That's amazing.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   Yeah, that's really awesome.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.280]   But that's a problem because it's a huge hit on a server.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   I mean, you just, you know.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.240]   Yeah, and that's the reason we actually started to go with an asterisk server for calls and
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   whatnot.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:09.800]   But ultimately for clarity and quality, we decided to just invest in the equipment.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.200]   And so now we've got an actual six lines coming in, an actual toll-free line that people
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   can call.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.920]   We're going to be connecting a modem to one of the machines so that people can leave
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.000]   voice mails and MP3 format and all that.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.200]   And you're streaming is Windows Media?
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.120]   Yeah, it's a Windows Media stream.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.840]   It will work in every operating system, either M Player and Linux or the Windows Media Player
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.000]   and OS X should work just fine.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   32-kilobits?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.440]   It depends.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.640]   But I think Jake usually streams out.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.240]   Jake Ludington is my engineer for it.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.120]   Usually streams out between 32-48.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.880]   We try to keep it pretty good quality.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.440]   Yeah, that's really neat.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.320]   Well, congratulations and congratulations on the success of Numbdex this year.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.400]   I think this is really going to be a watershed for you.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.120]   It's going to be a transformation.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.720]   I have a strange feeling.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.720]   It's kind of scary.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   I've got these butterflies in my stomach now.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   No one, baby.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   You're known now.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   Which scares me.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   Well, good luck.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   It's a great talk to Chris.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   Thanks, guys.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   Please don't be a stranger and-- Oh, yeah.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   I loved it.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   Anytime.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.600]   If I can help, quit anytime, just let me know.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   You got it.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   Thank you very much, Chris.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   See you guys.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   Take care.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   Chris Parela, ladies and gentlemen, the locker.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   See you.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   See you.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   No.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.760]   Steve Rubell did not get arrested for selling Coke.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   He did run Studio 54.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.320]   He had arrested for tax evasion, right?
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   Maybe it was tax evasion.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.480]   He's dead now, so I guess he won't be suing me.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.920]   So moving right along, ladies and gentlemen, shall we continue with the news?
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.680]   And then I have another special guest I'd like to introduce in a little bit.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   I had another special guest.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.400]   Yes, it's starting to be like one of those shows where people show up and just say hi
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   and she moves.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.920]   Actually, this is a story that you brought up Leo.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:55.560]   It's kind of funny, Samsung's pushing that 16-- is it 16 gigabyte flash drives together?
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.880]   They're going to do 16 gigabyte and they say within a year or two, 100 gigabyte flash
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   drives.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.920]   Now, these new flash drives are as fast as normal speed hard drive.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.480]   But there's no moving parts.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.320]   They're low power.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.200]   I mean, it may very well be your next laptop has instead of a hard drive, a flash drive.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   And I think that's exciting.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   That would be so cool.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   Don't you think?
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.480]   I read a bunch of people writing, "This is going to do amazing things for battery life
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   in portable computers."
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   They got to do something.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   Well, it's going to do a little bit.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.920]   The screen takes up 40 or 50 minutes of battery life.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.480]   The processor, I've heard estimates ranging anywhere from like 5 to about 15 to 20 percent.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.880]   The hard drive, about 8 percent of the battery life.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   No kidding.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   You would have thought that was more.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.520]   Well, they do incredible things to manage the hard drive.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.520]   They do a lot of caching and system memory.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   So spinning down a lot.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.000]   They spin down a lot and they manage it pretty well.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.480]   I mean, if you want to completely destroy the battery life in your notebook, turn the
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:59.520]   screen brightness all the way up and start downloading BitTorrent over a wireless connection.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.160]   Optical drives too.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.280]   Yeah, that's why I always put this.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.920]   I put DVDs on the hard drive thinking in trying to save some battery life, but I don't
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.360]   think I don't know if it makes a big difference.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.000]   It probably helps a bit.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.200]   Yeah, because the hard drive is going to be running anyway because of the operating system.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   I guess it has to.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   So it's not spinning up.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.480]   You don't have the lasers and the pickups and all the electronics in the drive itself.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   One less drive running basically.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.760]   What I want to know is what the prices on these are going to be because traditionally
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.840]   flash based drives have been incredibly expensive.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.160]   Yeah, but look at the drop in prices in these USB drives.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.880]   You can get a gig under a hundred bucks.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.280]   So well under a hundred bucks.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.200]   So I think that with demand and it ramped up production, you're seeing pretty low prices.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.920]   I mean, look, we get hard drive is less than a buck a gig.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.720]   So they got a long way to go.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.400]   But I think you could see this.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.200]   It's supposed to get an OLED screen and get the power.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.680]   But if they can get the screen life down or just big fat honking batteries that last
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   all day.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.880]   Something's got to give.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.960]   We haven't seen a huge improvement in battery tech.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.640]   I guess the lithium ion and lithium ion cell gels are big improvements, but something's
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.600]   got to give you know, they're making tritium batteries.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.440]   This is something you don't want.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:14.560]   The new batteries are basically nuclear, little nuclear reactors in your computer.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.000]   They're made out of tritium and you just better hope they don't leak.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.440]   Some hope tritium batteries may one day be more appropriate than chemical batteries for
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.960]   applications of relatively small amounts of power.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   I love Wikipedia.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.520]   It's only one plate around the fuel cells for.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.080]   I think fuel cells offer a lot of help.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.480]   She must have been pushing really soon.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   Definitely.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.560]   Then you'll have when instead of plugging in, when you run down, you'll have like a little
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.240]   butane lighter fluid thing.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.360]   You can't carry on the plane with you.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.400]   But the other thing people are playing around with is they're saying that by using like
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:52.240]   nano level structures, basically using nano tech, basically using nano scale surfaces on
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.400]   the, I don't know what you want to call the layers inside of the battery.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.560]   It allows them to become much more efficient and the idea that you'll be able to have these
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.720]   orders of magnitude and improvement in battery performance.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.520]   I'm hoping because clearly that's really the limiting factor in your cell phone right
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   now in the Cape.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   It's not so much time.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.520]   It's just the capabilities.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:15.160]   You have to keep it low power so that you have at least a day's worth of charge.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   That's nice.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.160]   That would be very a two pound.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.760]   APC actually recently came out with a notebook battery that I'm hoping to get a chance to
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.600]   test because it's like instead of being a $600, like the electric bias cells, which
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.800]   are like $600, this is like $200, $250.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.920]   I have one of these little pads over here.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.920]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   I can't really reach it because I'm on the microphone.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   But it's the same.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.560]   It's just, you know, it's a flat battery pack.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.920]   I don't think it's anything special, but it's just a flat battery pack.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.280]   Yeah, that's very similar to that.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   It looks like this.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   But that's not very expensive.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   Well, it depends on what you consider.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.120]   You can buy a notebook for $800 spending $600 on a battery.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   It looks kind of brutal.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   Leo and I are, like, he was very excited.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   He's just grabbed his battery.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   He was now examining the fine print on the phone.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.280]   I'm not sure that I'm about to be a long flight to Copenhagen.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.480]   And I'm sorry, you're going to Copenhagen on Tuesday.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.880]   I'm sure I had that right.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.200]   Yeah, that's why you're going to be producing the Twitcast for the next two weeks.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.800]   This is the Mac.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:21.760]   I'm going on a Geek Cruise to wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.560]   After Copenhagen, we set sail for adventure on the love boat.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   Yeah, baby.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.080]   What's the theme of the Geek Cruise that you're going on?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   Well, this is the thing.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.920]   It's a Macmaniac 3.5.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.840]   There's a digital photography co-seminar.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.600]   And then there's also a big Star Trek seminar.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.240]   So Star Trek.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.600]   Well, it's not associated, but we're all in the same boat.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.360]   So that should be interesting, don't you think?
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.320]   Yeah, I can think of things in what?
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   Wow.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:56.560]   I would make anyone on this podcast happier than being trapped in the ocean with a boat
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   bow of Trekias.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.080]   Well, I can...
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.280]   I can make it even better if you want.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.440]   I can tell you who's going to be on the cruise.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.720]   I mean, some of my best friends are Trekias.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.280]   I'm a huge fan of Will Wheaton.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.080]   I know the Trekias have actually given him a lot of hate along with the love over the
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.080]   years.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   Let me just look up because there's some really fabulous...
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.200]   Oh, you got Mark Swain, Wozniak, Bertman Roy.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.680]   Actually, Wozniak bowed out.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:30.600]   I'm very sorry to say he had to do some depositions, so he can't go silly.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   You know?
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   Bad lives are much more exciting.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   Chris Breen.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.080]   Chris Breen will be there, Jason Snell.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   That's going to be fun, but I was actually...
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.080]   These are all awesome people.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   Oh, it's going to be great.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.800]   Woz is fun to cruise with, actually.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   I really enjoy Woz.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.640]   I think the Wang woman can make it killing, honestly.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   I was just going to say, I think...
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   You guys need my friends.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   Send them in.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.720]   Don't tempt me.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.040]   That's all I can say.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.840]   I mean, I'm just looking to see if I can find a Star Trek...
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.080]   Oh, well.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:05.000]   Here are a number of well-known actors from episodes of the Star Trek, and I think a guy
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.160]   who wrote three episodes is going to be on there too.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.920]   Yeah, so that's pretty exciting.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.560]   Don't jump up and down or anything.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.480]   We're all doing our right conditions of excitement at the moment.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   I can't find...
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   I'm also going to try to find the names of these guys.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   I'll keep you...
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   Is he called "Cruise Trek"?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.600]   I don't know what it is.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.760]   I don't know what it is.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.560]   Well, when you're in, it's going to be wild.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.560]   It's going to be gardens.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.560]   Have you been there?
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   I hear it's beautiful.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.560]   Very cool.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.560]   It's awesome.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   I'm dying to do that, and we're going to go to Lego Land.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   The original Lego Land.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   So that'll be really fun.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   Yeah, well, good job.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.280]   Crew check 0-5, the Baltic blast.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   That's it.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   You're already at the glide tent.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   That's it.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   Who's going to be on that?
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   I'm giving you a second.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   That's the Baltic blast.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   The Baltic blast.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   Oh.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.840]   Actually, this is pretty amazing.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840]   You're got Copenhagen...
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.840]   St. St. Petersburg.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.840]   Helsinki, Finland.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.840]   Stockholm.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.840]   Yeah, it's part of my world tour.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   Yeah, it's going to be great.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   Wow.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   Do you have a picture for that, Leo?
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   I do.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.080]   As a matter of fact, I'm glad you asked.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.680]   There is, in fact, and I'll put a link on the show notes.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.200]   Is there going to be a book?
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.280]   There's no book.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.760]   But there is a...
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.840]   There's a Wayne and Akron.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.600]   Well, I have to be honest with you.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.960]   Wayne and Akron put together a cafe press store with the Leo World Tour T-shirts, mugs, thongs,
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   the works.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   We've sold 36 dollars.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   I will wear it.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   I will wear it.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.680]   You've sold so many two months, 36 items.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.160]   It is not exactly a huge success.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.160]   And I don't know why.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.680]   You want the thong, you got the thong.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.200]   I'll make sure that one's shipping.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   Prager YouTube, baby.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   YouTube.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   You know, I think...
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   What are you talking about?
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.000]   We need a new cover photo for the podcast.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.520]   Maybe the two of you in a thong really would really...
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.520]   I think it's Prager.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.520]   Something for the guys.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.520]   I think it's Prager.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   Just Prager.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   Prager's the best mascot in the world.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.520]   Are you kidding me?
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.520]   Actually, you know what I've found?
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.760]   Prager, I found pictures of you when you were growing your hair out into the giant blonde
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   afro.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   Dude.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   I cried when you cut that hair off.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   You looked amazing.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   Did you find that on...
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.720]   There was a before and after shot way back in Leo's old Mo Blogger's current Mo Blog.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.520]   But it's all back in the history of the Mo Blog.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.440]   The good old days.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.080]   You know, there's all this information about the cruise track, but I can't find any information
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.160]   on about who's actually...
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.040]   They don't want to say, because you know, these guys, what happens is they agree to do it
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.240]   and then they don't show up.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.960]   So they don't really want to say.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   But sometimes, you know, like Brent Spiner sometimes says he'll come.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:42.400]   So here's something that kind of merges traveling and technology.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   I was just looking on travelocity.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.760]   And they say there was something about two out of five people have to sneak away, quote
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.400]   unquote, to check their email or their voice.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   Big time.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   It should be totally out.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.880]   You can be out of a closet on that ship.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   Everybody is fully out.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.640]   Nobody needs to sneak away to do anything.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   No, I'm here.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Perfectly acceptable.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   I'm here.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.640]   I'm here.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   No, it's post 9/11.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.920]   You can't go see the bridge.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.480]   There is nobody driving the ship.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.480]   Have you ever seen the big freighters?
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   There's nobody there.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.480]   The container ships.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.480]   There's one guy.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   The big container ships are right.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   It's all automated isn't it?
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   Yeah right.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.480]   No it's your last trainer.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   It's totally automated.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   And you've got a ship that's like two-foot-ball-seals.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   Nobody driving.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   It's empty.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   You would think, you know, we're going to the bridge.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.200]   You'd expect like a couple of guys with pipes and people measuring things on the ch-no.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.760]   And I said, well how do you get your weather?
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.320]   I said, what the fax machine was?
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   Keep the measuring thing.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   Shut up.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.920]   Where are we going?
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.440]   And they said no, no, we don't get faxes for the weather anymore.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.120]   They just email it to us.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.320]   And then so the emergency Mayday, I said where's your radio officer?
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.640]   Where's sparks, right?
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   Somebody's got a Mayday.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   They have any flares.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   They don't have radio.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.640]   They don't have may.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   Radio men anymore.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.760]   They pick up the phone if the ship is sinking.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   They call 911.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.600]   Well that's the whole thing.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.560]   I wish you could talk to one of the guys that still works at G4 who is in charge of IT
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.560]   in the studio.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.640]   He used to, he helped wire the Queen Mary II.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.640]   God's amazing.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   And I'm sure he's got a well-known man.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.680]   I mean the fire control there is just incredible.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.720]   They can monitor you through the little spigot in your sprinkler.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.280]   What temperature your room is in every single room and then if it gets very hot of course
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.280]   they know.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.080]   But that's what's happening with large scale buildings.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.560]   With large scale buildings now, like the Zig Me control systems and stuff and the idea
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.920]   is you're creating a mesh network.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.360]   You can create a wireless network.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.280]   They're talking about putting in tens of thousands of these for the light switches.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   The light is for the heating and cooling for the AC switches.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.040]   So the idea is you can basically figure out which part of the building is using the heat,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.120]   which part of the building is it using the heat whose temperature up.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.640]   You can automatically shut the lights off.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.840]   You know if a light bulb goes out it automatically tells you it's amazing the level of control
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.840]   they're starting to make.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.240]   They steer these ships with joysticks.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.480]   You would like this rubber.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.120]   They have a, talk about Nintendo Thumb.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.760]   They have bow thrusters.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.640]   They basically can micro position the ship anyway.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.360]   They're still a tremendous amount of ski.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   Those are neat.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   Oh yeah, well there's no brakes.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   I said where's the brakes?
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.840]   Oh I'm sorry we don't have brakes.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.840]   Well you know.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.520]   For all of the technology, for fire suppression navigation all of that until they get the
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.080]   whole being able to keep a stomach flu from racing through a ship.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   Yes, that's true.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.640]   Taking them back into port.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   It's always there right.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.240]   It just sounds like a nightmare situation.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   Well they have, you know it's interesting.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.240]   I'd much further lay on the beach.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.440]   They do pay attention to that.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.720]   They have little alcohol.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   They're things that they have in hospitals.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.160]   They have alcohol hand scrubbing units everywhere.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   And they encourage you to watch this.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.160]   They have those in the slot machines now before you got to cash your chips as a disgusting.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.560]   You can get your little wife post things.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.720]   Can you imagine who's been on that slot machine?
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   Geez.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   Oh.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.120]   Nickel slots are the worst.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.080]   Yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:23.440]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:30.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:49.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:09.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.360]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   the, the, the, the, the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
