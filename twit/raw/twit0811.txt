[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   This show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   We've got a great panel assembled.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   The return of Bran O'Woo of the Rebel Alliance.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   No wait a minute.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   What's the name of it?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   Rebellion Pack.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   Rebellion Pack.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   I kind of like the Rebel Alliance, right?
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   I think Disney would have sued us about that.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   They tried to make Admiral Ackbar the mascot of my
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   college football team.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   That didn't go well.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   We were really worried they were going to sue us for
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   rebellion, but fingers crossed.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   I can see Admiral Ackbar saying it's a pack.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   That would be a great logo.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   That would be a great logo.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   I'll see what I can do.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Make it the sneaky.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   Don't tell George logo.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Anyway, great to have you well.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   I'm going to ask you all about rebellion pack a little bit.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Don't forget that's where you work.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   I will try very hard.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   Also joining us from the information.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   She's a reporter there and always welcome here.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Paris Martino.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   Good to see you Paris.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   Good to see you.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Good to be here.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   Is the snow melted in New York or is it still?
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   Oh no, it's still piling up.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   Getting a little slushy so that you slip.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   But still there.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   There's a car on the corner of my street that has been
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   entombed in like six or so feet of snow for almost a month.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   I'm waiting to see what happens to it.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   The snowplaz come by and they blow it up onto the car.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   So it's truly insane.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   You can't see the car from any side.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   It just looks like an iceberg, but there's definitely a vehicle on there.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   There's a pony in there somewhere.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   And then every week they come by again and bury it some more.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   So it's perfect.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   It's great.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   The poor guy who owns that.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   They haven't used it in a month.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   I guess not.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   Mm.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   No where to go.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   No where to go.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Also thrilled to have Lindsay Turrentine from beautiful San Francisco
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   where she is now regretting spending the next two hours.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   I'm going to love every second of it, but I'm also going to look out the window
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   at the wake 70 degree weather and pine.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   We haven't had a nice weather in a while.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   I mean, look, I feel bad saying anything because our friends in Texas,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   we had Wesley Faulkner from Austin on a couple of weeks ago and it had just started.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   And then there was a screaming from his kids and he said,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   "Oh, the snow's starting to fall."
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   And it was like excitement.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   But as it turned out, it didn't turn out all that well.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   I think Wesley's fine.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   But boy, what a mess.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   What a mess down there.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   So our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to all of our friends in the great state of Texas.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   I hope things are starting to look a little bit better.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   Meanwhile, depending on your point of view, things are looking a lot better
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   or a lot worse in Australia where Facebook has decided to respond to the threat of the --
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Now, people might say in Australia the legislature in Australia might say,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   "It's a snippet tax."
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   They're just asking Google and Facebook for a little money to pay back publishers
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   for the snippets they publish.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   But a lot of others, including Mike Mack and Masnick at Tech Dirt,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   are saying it's really a link tax, the worst kind of Internet tax.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.600]   It isn't a law yet, but it looks like the legislation will go ahead,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   originally called for by Rupert Murdoch.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   It's interested in comparing contrast to the two responses.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   Google decided to get down to the negotiation table, made a deal,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   paid apparently some -- we don't know how much, but a significant amount of money
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   to the news publishers and said, "All right, we're done.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   No problem."
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   This after threatening to pull out entirely of Australia.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   Facebook not only didn't negotiate, even before the law became a law,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   they have cut off news.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   And in Australia, that means about one-fifth of the population that gets its
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   news from Facebook has to look elsewhere.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   The Australian Broadcasting Company app became the number one app briefly on the iPhone store.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   It also means that I think fairly critical Australian government news sources
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   have also been cut off.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   Brianna, what is this an overreaction from Facebook,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   or is it justified?
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   You know, Leah, I was hoping you would go to Paris or someone else first because
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   you don't care.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   You don't care.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   It's not that I don't care.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   It's that I'm an engineer, an engineer sometimes when we know we don't --
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   like this is a very complex topic, right?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   Facebook says according to us, you're getting the better deal publishers
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   because we're driving traffic to your site.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   Okay.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   And then, on the other hand, some publishers feel very strongly
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   that Facebook is kind of monopolizing the -- people get to Facebook,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   they don't go to individual websites anymore.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   So it kind of stops that flow through effect and it forces publishers to,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   you know, get the most viral articles that they can't.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   I truly see both sides.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   So on this, I'm kind of more inclined to keep my mouth shut and listen to people.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   Well, I'll go to Paris Martina, who is in fact a journalist reporter.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   I don't think you would step up and defend Rupert Murdoch and the newspapers
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   in Australia and say, hey, they deserve to be -- I mean, honestly, isn't the problem
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   that the Internet is putting newspapers out of business, not Google or Facebook
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   particularly?
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   I think it's complicated.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   I think that the Internet has changed the way that people's changed habits
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   and changed the way that people understand news as a product.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   They view the information that they're getting as a part of this social network
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   that they're participating in in the case of Facebook rather than individual
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   articles and news products that they are consuming that were produced by
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   news gathering outlets that employ people that had to actually make that.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   And I think that that is a much larger issue than Facebook's activity in one country.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   But Facebook is inherently involved in it.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   And I don't know.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   I think it's -- one of those questions that's certainly above the pay grade of --
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   I don't have to worry about it.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   Except that we might have to worry about it because Canada and many countries
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   in Europe are looking at this Australian legislation as a template for what they might want to do.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   And I think if that happened, it could -- it would be really interesting to see what happens next.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   Like, what happens to the news media ecosystem?
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   What happens to news literacy?
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   What happens to the information age?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   If people suddenly have to go and visit news sites once again,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   if they don't just -- if they're not just being fed, whatever inflammatory headline
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   they come across first from freedom, eagle.wing.us.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   That was my first reaction is that Facebook -- the news -- so-called news feed -- this was confusing.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   The news was originally news from your friends and family in high school sweethearts.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   But it became a feed of actual news.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   I think the Facebook news feed would do well without all of that, you know, news.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   Because I -- I think I'm not a member of Facebook anymore.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   But when I joined it, I thought that the promise was you're going to stay in touch with friends and family.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   That seems like a perfectly reasonable goal for Facebook.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   Here's what Facebook says.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   It's an unequal relationship.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   Last year, Facebook generated 5.1 billion free referrals -- free referrals to the Australian publishers.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   And we estimate that's worth about $407 million.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   For Facebook, the business gained from news is minimal.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   Again, I'm quoting Facebook's own post.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their news feed.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   So they say it's an unequal relationship and you want us to pay you when we're really doing you a favor.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   Lindsay, you agree?
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   Like Para said, it is complicated.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   I think about this all the time.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   It's like my job to think about this.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   Here are some of the realities of the situation.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   Facebook says that 4% of its news feed comes from actual news.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   And if that were true, it wouldn't care.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   That's true.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   Wouldn't cost too much to pay those people.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   I mean, I think it's really important to see it in average news feed on Facebook.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   And I don't spend time on Facebook either, but I've spent a lot of time poking around for business reasons.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   It's -- I just -- for one thing, I don't really believe that it's true.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   Like, as a percentage of posts, it may be 4%.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   But as a percentage of what you see --
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   That's a very good distinction.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   They may be hiding the truth.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   Right.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   Way more than 4%.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   One of the problems with Facebook is that the algorithms in Facebook tend to push into your feed things that are controversial or things that are scary.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   And a lot of that comes from news sources.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   The other thing that I'm really interested in and actually frankly very worried about is if somebody is getting most of their news from Facebook.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   And I do not recommend doing that, but a lot of people do.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   And people getting most of their news from Facebook, and they're not really paying attention to this, and it slowly changes.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   I think it would be great if everybody kind of left and went to a good trusted primary news source to get their news.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   But I'm worried that what might happen is that some freedom eagle.net or whatever you said that was very funny, Paris, might become a trusted news source on Facebook because it is not identified as news.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   It's just something somebody wrote on their -- like on Medium or on their own blog,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   or they're actually just writing to Facebook as a primary source.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   So I'm worried that it makes the disinformation and misinformation problem worse.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   It's sort of a fact.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   And I think from an execution standpoint, by the way, this has been really messy.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   One of the things that's interesting is that -- and I still do not have confirmation on why exactly this happened.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   I don't know if it was a mistake, but when all of this rolled out last week in Australia, CNET, which has a publishing office in Australia, it's our Australian news publishing stopped, of course.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   But actually, Facebook shut down everything.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   So our page was blank.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   Because we happened to publish in Australia.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   I believe that was a mistake.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   So --
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   And it's been fixed.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   Okay.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   So it's really messy, and it just goes to show that Facebook itself is reacting quickly,
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   and probably it's such a complex web of sources that they're not even really able to stop exactly what they intend to stop.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   It does feel like Google -- it feels like a threat and execute.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Like, they should have made the threat and then executed instead of just doing it.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   But maybe they felt like Google tried that and it didn't work.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   They did.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   They did actually make a threat a while ago, basically, nobody paying attention to it.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   Okay.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   Wow.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   Wow.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   I think what concerns me about this is -- in God knows, I hate -- it makes me die inside sticking up for Facebook because they're such a garbage company.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   But we've seen so much balkanization of the Internet, and Lindsay Efoli agreed with what you're saying, like, consider the source when you're hearing these numbers from, you know, Facebook press release there.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   Never forget they lied about, like, video views.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   They've lied about all kinds of things, just not been forthright with data with people.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   But at the same time, I agree with what you're saying, Leo, that a link tax, what that's going to end up doing in practice is they're going to decrease the amount of information that they put from publishers who are asking to be paid, and then people
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   that are asking not to get paid, or get pumped up higher in the news feed, so, you know, because it's cheaper for Facebook.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:26.600]   So I think that will facilitate blogs and, you know, non-reputable sources or people with actual journalistic integrity.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   I think that's going to accelerate that tendency of people to do it, and I think it's going to accelerate this balkanization of the Internet.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   So it's just, it's so hard because I see how Facebook has stacked the deck against small publishers.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   We all want journalists to get paid.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   I just, I'm not convinced this is going to be an effective way to get there.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   Well, in fact...
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   The other part of that, I just want to grab onto that because I really agree with what you're saying, and be happy, like, on behalf of small publishers, and also,
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   Facebook has done everything it can to try to get publishers small and large to publish content on Facebook as a primary destination,
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   as opposed to simply linking to Facebook, to content on Facebook.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   They would rather that you partner with Facebook and do things like create video series that run on Facebook as a primary source.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   So Facebook, while it says, kind of, "Yeah, we're not really interested in news as a business proposal.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   They're just not interested in news that's not theirs as a business proposal."
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   And so that's just one more compounding issue here.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   They were damned if they did, damned if they didn't.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   I mean, Google got a lot of heat for making a deal with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Well, the publishers, but primarily Rupert Murdoch.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   And Facebook got damned for cutting off news in Australia.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   It seems like there was no good response from either company.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   Those are the two possible responses.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   And I think that's of the fact because this has been a problem that has been growing for years and years,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   and addressing it now after it has gotten, years after it got to be a problem.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   I mean, this has been something we've been talking about for a long time,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   and trying to address it now is going to be infinitely more complicated than these companies are prepared for,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600]   or news publishers are prepared for.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   So that is just, I think, natural effect of how entrenched news has gotten into these platforms
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   and into social media content overall.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   And when I say news, I mean both links to news articles, and like Lindsay was saying,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   this sort of native content that Facebook is asking publishers to create for them.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   And you're also right, Brianna, because Facebook and Google could weather this in either direction.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   They make plenty of money.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   It's not the end of the world for them.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   It's the small publishers who might be much more reliant on Facebook, for instance, or Google Search,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   that's what happened in Spain when Google cut off Google News in Spain.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   For the same reasons, the publishers end up giving in, screaming,
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   "Please put back the search results. We're losing traffic."
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   Lindsay, have you seen a dip in traffic on CNET? Because of this?
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   By the way, I did not give you your title, Lindsay Turinstein.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   She is a senior vice president at CNET for exactly this content and audience.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   So this is, you're right. Have you, is it hurt?
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   Well, our Australian audience is a pretty small percentage of our total audience.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   It hurt for a minute while this mistake was happening.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.600]   So you still have a page there that people could go to?
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   Yes, and that we published from.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   So CNET publishes to Facebook.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   And that was not cut off.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   It was cut off globally.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   And that was a mistake.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   Oh, so it's cut, but it is still cut off in Australia, but not cut off in the rest of the world.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   Correct.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   Cut off in Australia, just like any publishers publishing pages cut off in Australia.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   So we can no longer post content that is specifically targeted to the Australian audience from Australia.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   But for a minute, we weren't able to post content at all, which was a mistake.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.600]   But it's just sort of indicative of the kind of, we have people who job it is to communicate with Facebook
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   and let them know that something is going wrong.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   That's a big part of your business.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   I mean, it would be bigger if you were bigger in Australia, but it could be a, for a lot of publishers,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   I'm sure it is a big part of their business.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   Oh, certainly.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   And if you are a large publisher who targets Australia, you obviously, obviously this applies specifically to Australian media.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   But there may be publishers outside of Australia in the APAC region more generally, very focused on that audience who are being very much hurt by this.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   This seems like, I never thought in a million years I'd say, I feel sorry for Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   But I kind of do because it seems, first of all, Facebook is constantly hit by, for anti-democratic, you know,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   posts on Facebook.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   I think a lot of people blame it for the January 6th insurrection.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   They just now took down the military junta in Myanmar's page, but it was up for a long time and very much, you know,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   in the Philippines and Myanmar and other countries, Facebook's very much been used for anti-democratic action.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   So they get a lot of heat for that.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   They get a lot of heat from news publishers for stealing, I'll put that in scare quotes.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   And they're getting heat from then other people at the same time and say, "Yes, but the press needs you, Facebook,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   because you're giving people access to news.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   You cannot.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   There's no way in that environment that you could win."
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   Well, it's pretty tough.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   It's the consequence of being a company that their whole goal was to grow to this size and larger and to become the de facto Internet.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   If your goal is to be the medium for most human online communication,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   you're going to have to deal with all of the problems and consequences of becoming that platform.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.600]   And they may be intractable.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   I wonder if you let go of, we always go back to how it's almost impossible to grow any social media platform without AI.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   And if you walk away from the algorithm, you could probably do a much better job.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   What if you walked away from...
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   We're still going to straight feed.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   What if you walked away from a World hegemony and just said, "I want to be a United States company?"
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   You'd still have headwinds, but at least you'd be able to know who to negotiate with.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   But then you can't grow to the size of Facebook.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   So I think Paris, you're exactly right.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.600]   This is the deal that Mark made.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   This is what he wanted.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.600]   Now he's got it.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   Don't feel sorry for it.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   And it's complicated.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   It's complicated.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   Who I guess.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   Yeah, be careful what you wish for.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   What's the solution?
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   Brianna, you wanted to be a politician.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.600]   What's the solution?
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.600]   I think it really comes back to what Paris is talking about.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.600]   Like this was his goal.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   He didn't just...his monopoly didn't happen serendipitously.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   He bought out every single competitor along the way.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   I am of the opinion.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   Facebook, Phil, and just anti-competitive behavior.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.600]   And I believe Facebook needs to be broken up.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.600]   Functionally, I say this is someone who buys a lot of political ads.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   Facebook is a duopoly.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.600]   Facebook and Google are duopoly.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   Two checks I've ever written to anyone online when it comes to ads.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.600]   Is Facebook or Google?
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   I think when you have that much power, these kinds of problems are bound to crop up.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:58.320]   Imagine a different universe where a social media network with more news, more straight
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.960]   news could have proliferated.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.120]   That would have been amazing.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.600]   But this is his bad.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.280]   He's laying in it.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:11.200]   I don't think it's surprising if people are coming to him and trying to drive a hard
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   market.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.640]   We kind of skated past like Canada looking at implementing these same policies.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:24.920]   I fully love the idea of different countries coming together and forming alliances and
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.000]   their policies with Facebook looking for common goals because one on one, Facebook is just
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.600]   going to pick them off.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.000]   If they're all strong together, I have no doubt eventually they will get a deal that's better
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.920]   for journalists and news companies.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.480]   I will channel Jeff Jarvis as one of our hosts on this week in Google and a journalism professor
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.440]   who would say, "Really, it's the publisher's fault for not embracing the new digital era
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.880]   thoroughly and offering people a way to get news."
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.320]   They just didn't understand it and they ended up hurting themselves by trying to continue
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.280]   doing what they were doing.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.760]   That's partly because I think Jeff was the guy who went around like Paul Revere saying
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.520]   that the Internet's are coming, the Internet's are coming and was roundly ignored by news
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.680]   organizations all over the world.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:22.880]   Roland 00 and the chatroom has created your new logo, Brianna Wu.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.480]   Please send that to me.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.720]   It's on the Twitter.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   It's on the Twitters.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   I can't wait to.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.360]   Although, Matthew, can you make it it's a pact?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.160]   It should be a contraction, right?
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   Not it is a pact.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.560]   I think Admiral Ackbar liked the contractions.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.680]   I may be wrong on that, but I don't know.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   You're right.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   We're going to use that.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   We're going to use that.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   There is news.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.320]   BuzzFeed had a story on Friday that while Facebook was about to ban Alex Jones and his
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.880]   Info Wars channel for hate speech, Mark Zuckerberg changed the rules.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.400]   He said he didn't consider them to be a hate figure according to a person familiar with
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   the decision.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.960]   He overruled his own internal experts and opened a gaping loophole.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.920]   BuzzFeed reports, this is Ryan Mack and Craig Silverman, Facebook would permanently ban
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:16.120]   Jones and his company but would not touch posts of praise and support for them from
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.520]   other Facebook users.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.840]   He said, "Okay, you can't publish, but everybody else can publish your stuff on Facebook."
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.080]   Mark didn't like the punishment, so he changed the rules.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.680]   That's said the former policy employee.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.840]   In a way, he has made his own bet here.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.480]   Zuckerberg has by moving the playing field.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.960]   Mike Masnick in Tech Dirt said, "The bizarre reaction to Facebook's decision to get out
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.160]   of news business in Australia, he lauds it.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.880]   He praises it."
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.800]   He says, "Facebook is a terrible, terrible company and deserves lots of blame.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.480]   For lots of bad things, but this ain't it.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.320]   This is Facebook standing up for freedom on the Internet," says Mike Masnick.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.960]   Meanwhile, Congressman Dave Chitulini, what committee is he on, Brianna?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.520]   Is he on the antitrust committee?
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.680]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   I don't know.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.400]   He's from Rhode Island's first district.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.440]   He's the antitrust subcommittee chairman.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:26.280]   He tweeted, "If it's not already clear, Facebook is not compatible with democracy.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   This is the guy, the Democrat, who's going to be leading the charge in the investigation
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.920]   against Facebook," I should point out.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.480]   Threatening to bring an entire country to its knees to agree to Facebook's terms is the
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.080]   ultimate admission of monopoly power."
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   So there's that.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   Again.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   Do you?
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.280]   I don't want it, but I kind of feel sorry for more.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   Go ahead.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.600]   I just think that this is, that it is possible.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.240]   I mean, there's some hyperbole there, I would assume.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.960]   Does anybody think that it is possible that not publishing news on Facebook in Australia
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.360]   is going to bring the country to its knees?
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.360]   Quite the opposite.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   Quite the opposite.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.840]   And in fact, if it does help people find other sources, I don't know, maybe that needs
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840]   to happen.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.680]   Like maybe this is the fix.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.920]   It's just going to be messy.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:17.000]   That's kind of my thinking is, "Would you do yourself a favor if you just stuck to
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.440]   what you said you were going to do, which is connect family and friends?
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   Isn't that really what's wrong with that?"
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.680]   But I mean, that would require Facebook admitting that, "No, what it means is it's not just
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.960]   about connecting family and friends about, 'Oh, you are using a fun app, TikTok or something.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.200]   We want to also be the place where you post those sort of reels.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.360]   Oh, you are thinking about getting into commerce or delivery type stuff.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   We want to be there as well."
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   We can do that.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.840]   It wants to be kind of the medium of everything.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:55.360]   And Mark, I mean, in that Alex Jones article you just mentioned, it is evident that he wants
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.560]   to be involved in all of the nuances of these kind of decisions around news.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.960]   And you can't have it both ways.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:08.760]   You can't want to be part of everything and be able to make these sort of strange calls
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.080]   personally yourself.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.840]   And then when a country like Australia asks you, "Hey, this is very complicated and we needed
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.600]   a solution from you that's going to fix it."
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.040]   Be like, "Oh, that's too much for me, man.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.240]   I don't know why I should be involved.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   I'm out of here.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   We're just going to pull out."
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   I'm taking my parents going home.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.720]   Paris, can I piggyback off of that?
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.840]   Because I think it's such a good point.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.680]   I think it's so telling in this story what Mark chooses to get involved with and what
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.400]   he chooses to sit out.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.920]   There's a major story that came out last year about Facebook bringing in some experts
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.400]   in racial inclusion and how that would impact the newsfeed.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.040]   And they came forward with a whole host of suggestions.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.640]   They tried to get buy-in from Zuckerberg.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.960]   And he flat out said, "I don't want to get involved here.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.880]   Don't bring this to me again."
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.320]   That was in the story.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.120]   But he does want to get involved with giving out Jones a free pass.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.760]   There is ample reporting out there.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.920]   My friend Clara over at Mother Jones.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:15.000]   Their news outlet was decimated by some of Facebook's decisions and how to wait their
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.720]   company versus other companies.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.360]   Yet you hear stories about people like Ben Shapiro after repeatedly breaking the rules
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:31.080]   with the way they get things up-ranked and shared more virally.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.720]   They are or are diamond and silk.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.000]   They are allowed to break the rules over and over and over and over and over again and
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.720]   Facebook won't step in.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.360]   Something I feel really strongly about is it often bothers me when my friends on the
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:50.000]   left will make a joke that includes a death threat on Twitter.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.440]   And then they act indignant if the rules are applied to that.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.600]   It's like no, if you believe in this rule, it's one standard.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.120]   It applies to everyone.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.200]   That's the rule.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:09.760]   Here I think it's not reasonable if Mark is personally stepping in and disempowering these
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.080]   experts he's bringing in to make these kinds of decisions.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.320]   It's trying to have your cake and eat it too.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.360]   I would submit that there is a rule.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.440]   It's just not the rule you think.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.520]   That the real rule, the rule Mark follows, is not to do with left or right.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.880]   It has to do with engagement.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.960]   And if diamond and silk drive traffic and mother Jones doesn't, which I would submit
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:37.880]   is probably the case, then you prioritize diamond and silk.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.960]   It's not about politics.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.560]   I doubt very much it's about politics for Mark.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.000]   And this is the problem with algorithm.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   It's the problem on YouTube.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It's the problem on Twitter.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   It's the problem on Facebook.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.240]   Anywhere where posts are ranked by algorithm and the algorithm is designed to improve engagement
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.680]   to increase attention, you're going to get this.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:02.040]   This is just what happens because the real rule is whatever gets people to stay on the
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:09.880]   site and read more because the more they look at, the more ads they see, the more we make.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   Am I wrong?
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   Is that not really how all of these sites work?
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   You're correct.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.320]   But I mean, the issue is it would be one thing if they were transparent about that or
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.080]   at least transparent when they make these sort of decisions and saying, yeah, you know,
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.400]   we have these rules, but really we're prioritizing are the creators that are keeping our community
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.760]   engaged or submit that.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:36.800]   But no, they try and obvious skate to their actual intentions behind this idea that, oh,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.080]   we're really all just about protecting free speech.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.720]   Oh, you know, we have such high morals that we're defending.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   So you can't say that if that's not what you're doing.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.240]   And we know that's not what you're doing because that's not how people are running
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   businesses.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.640]   You need to just at a certain point state what you are actually doing, especially if you
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   are going to continue to be called to Congress to answer for your actions.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:08.720]   Honestly, I think that if Facebook is essentially an advertising company, like any company that
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.480]   it's a media company in its own way, I think maybe this if you asked a while ago, what's
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   the solution?
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.720]   Maybe the solution is for people purchasing advertisements to demand that the setting
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.720]   for those ads is high quality, just like they would demand that from an original publisher.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.720]   They do that now, though.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.680]   Really demand that from Facebook to say, look, I don't want to sit next to hyperbolic content.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.920]   I don't want to sit next to content that is all about fear.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.120]   And I'm actually kind of surprised that that hasn't happened.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120]   They would.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.760]   Facebook would have to respond to that, right?
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.280]   Because that's about they would have they would have to respond to it.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.240]   And most publishers actually do have to respond to this demand because there's this concept
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.760]   of brand safety and advertising.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.640]   So we get that.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.480]   I don't understand why brand safety hasn't.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.800]   We get that in our advertising contracts all the time.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.480]   In fact, a year ago, we got contracts from some advertisers said, we don't want to be
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:08.280]   any shows that mentioned COVID, which we lined that out of every contract because obviously
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.760]   that's ridiculous.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.400]   But I always thought advertisers did care about that.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   One of the problems with YouTube is that you don't know exactly where your ad, what the
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.200]   environment of your ad is going to be.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.440]   Maybe these maybe these sites like YouTube and Facebook are so lucrative that advertisers
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.920]   go, yeah, it's fine.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.800]   We'll be wherever you put us.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.280]   Well, we're starting to see something along those lines happen.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:37.120]   In July, there was kind of the first large kind of Facebook ad boycott.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   Right.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.440]   And then over a thousand companies participated in it.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.520]   And you know, Mark actually had meetings about it.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.320]   We was like, Oh, I don't think this is going to last.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.960]   I'm not sure that we're going to actually have to respond to this pressure.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:54.480]   But there were, you know, some market changes in the way that Facebook was operating just
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.360]   in response to this small movement.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   And I think happy way.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.560]   Or those companies still off Facebook.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.760]   I bet they're back.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.320]   I mean, look it up.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.680]   I bet you anything they're back.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   I bet Mark was.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.880]   Oh, I bet they're back.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.040]   That's ultimately how Facebook wins.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.560]   You cannot not be on Facebook.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.000]   Lindsay, I just wanted to jump on something you said a second ago, which is about like
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.360]   brand quality.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.720]   Like why are they looking out at, you know, seeing basically advertisers saying, let's
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.080]   make sure the stuff we're near as quality.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:33.440]   Leo, in practice, what my friend, my friend, Nandini over at she used to run Sleeping Giants.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.880]   She basically looks at a lot of advertisers and tells them when they're advertising on,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.960]   say, white supremacist sites and ends up getting them to pull down.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   That's a business.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   Wow.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   She has a business.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.720]   She is 10 out of 10.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   Amazing.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.880]   It's a phenomenal organization.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.320]   Yeah, she's great.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:58.200]   What she's found though is in practice when brands do exercise that they very specifically
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.560]   say we don't want to be near any content that may say black lives matter or anything to
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.960]   do with racial justice or gay rights.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.760]   It tends to make certain sectors of news reporting, which are already very difficult
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.960]   to get resources for.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.520]   It makes it even harder.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.400]   So I think based on her experience with that professionally, I would personally suspect
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.280]   that might not be the best direction.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.040]   It's a really good point.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:34.560]   It is always difficult to monetize bad news of any kind or even controversial news.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.080]   It seems like it would be worse to monetize.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.720]   It seems like it would be harder to monetize what has ended up creeping into Facebook, which
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.640]   is often false information.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:50.720]   So tying this all back to what gets the most engagement wins, it seems like that's what
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.760]   has to end.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:59.720]   Because the most engagement is often, not always, but often aligned with poor content.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   At least that seems like an avenue to pressure Facebook to do the right thing.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.640]   You're never Facebook's lack of a change.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.280]   And I think it's naive to assume that any, especially publicly held company is doing
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.320]   anything but maximize shareholder or stakeholder value.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.360]   I mean, that's what they do.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.000]   That's their job.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.640]   Corporations are fundamentally amoral.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   They're not bad or good.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.200]   They're just optimizing for profits.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   That's what they do.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   That's why they're designed.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   That's why they exist.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.760]   In fact, it's the big businesses.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.080]   I think they are more like that.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.000]   Small businesses like mine, we have the luxury of saying, "Well, we do think black lives
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.880]   matter and if that's going to bother some advertisers, well, the hell with it."
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.920]   Or some listeners, the hell with it.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.080]   We're going to do it anyway.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.920]   But that's because I'm small enough to be an ornery enough to be able to do that.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:51.560]   I doubt very much you'd see a big television network or a platform like Facebook make decisions
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   like that.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.560]   That's tough.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560]   That's tough.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.480]   I'm sure the stock market would punish them for that, which is even tougher.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   True.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.280]   Great conversation.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.320]   Branna Wu is with us.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.480]   Have you given up all political aspirations?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.960]   Oh, no, I am just biting my time to strike.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   Biting her time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.200]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   That's good news.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   Rebellion PAC.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.880]   That's her political action committee.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   That is.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.120]   Her donations are welcome, but I would read up what they're doing.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   Please do.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.640]   Because if you're diamond and silk, you're not going to want to give them money.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.880]   I probably got.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.280]   We did a lot of work.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.640]   We got tons of voters out in Georgia.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.000]   Obviously it was not all our win.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.640]   There are many other people.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.360]   But we were one of the soldiers that fought in that war and helped deliver the Senate
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   to the Democrats.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.160]   I'm very proud of that.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.360]   Rebellion PAC.com, if you want to know more.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.720]   That was a big deal.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   Good job.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.480]   It did not happen serendipitously.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.200]   I went from working 80 hour weeks in the presidential election to working 80 hour weeks
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   in Georgia.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.960]   And everybody was just deaf at that point.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.840]   What kills me is that now that the election is over so many local and state legislatures
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.720]   are now kind of doing all they can to eliminate voting.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.840]   That's really depressing.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.080]   It's really grim.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080]   It is.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.560]   And I take it that rebellion PAC is probably going to do what they can to stop that.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.960]   We have an ad coming out Monday encouraging people to pass the John Lewis voting rights
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   ad.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.240]   I don't care if you're right, left, libertarian center, whatever.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.000]   I want you to be able to vote.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.200]   This is just restoring the full protections of that.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   It's common sense.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.040]   We all want a fair game and that's our position.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.080]   Yeah, that seems like a tenable position.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.240]   I'm not saying how to vote.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   Just everybody.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.440]   Anybody who wants to vote should get to vote.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.680]   Well, that seems sensible to me.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.320]   You know, that's kind of how we built this country.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.480]   I thought maybe not.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.320]   I might be a wide eyed optimist, a naive Pollyanna.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   Also Paris Martin, oh, ensconced at the information.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.400]   Great to have you.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.880]   Great reporting coming out of the information lately.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.840]   What are you working on?
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   Oh, I'm working on a lot of stuff.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.200]   I cover Amazon.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.400]   So there is always a million different stories that I'm covering it all time.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.720]   You'll be getting to the Amazon in a little bit.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.360]   There's a lot going on over there.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   There is.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   It's the whole world.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   Didn't have itself.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.640]   Yes, it is.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.440]   And some really big scoops coming out of the information.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.640]   Somebody in the chat room was saying, "Who subscribes to it?
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   I do."
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.400]   And I have practically since Jessica Lesson started it.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.360]   It really is.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   It's not cheap, but it's worthwhile.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   I'm really glad to support this kind of journalism.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.760]   And you're journalism, Paris Martin.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   No.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   We also...
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   You're a lot of good guys.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   You don't have to subscribe to CNET.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   You just have to read it.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   Right?
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   Lindsay?
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.760]   That's true.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   There's no paywall.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.760]   Is there a paywall?
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.760]   There is no paywall.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.760]   No paywall.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   No paywall.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.680]   The information is an amazing B2B publication we are at.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   We are a...
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   P2C.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   Focus publication.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.680]   P2C.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680]   We are 100% C.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   And by the way...
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   100% C.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   It is your TikTok feta pasta recipe that I've been following.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.400]   All the rage, kids.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.720]   We have a number of people on staff making that pasta this weekend.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.200]   TikTok feta pasta.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.440]   Is there nothing TikTok can't do?
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.520]   And CNET, of course, last time you were on, we were talking about your great black Friday
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   coverage.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.400]   Anything you're working on, you want to share with us?
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.360]   This past week, we kicked off a series.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:44.000]   This is actually a little bit more serious about how we close the digital divide in the
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   United States.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.120]   There's a really good reporting on the site right now about just Americans who can't reliably
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.040]   get broadband and the FCC and how it's going to be fixed.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   Good.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.000]   So, there's a really good reporting on the site right now that you should go check out.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.760]   And we're also always, always focused on giving the best advice we can give on pretty
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   much everything.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.960]   I'm a fan.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.960]   We're an employee.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   It's like told you.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   I love it.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.120]   I love it.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   CNET.com.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:19.920]   Our show today brought to you by those great folks at Worldwide Technology.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.720]   I have a little nostalgic because it was almost exactly a year ago that Lisa and I took our
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.360]   very last trip to the outside world.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.080]   We went to St. Louis to see Worldwide Technology's Advanced Technology Center.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.760]   I could not believe it.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.920]   It started 10 years ago in one little building, just a few racks of enterprise equipment.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:45.200]   Worldwide Technology is an integrator, consultant, and seller of enterprise technology.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.000]   They're really the best in the business.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.680]   And they started building this Advanced Technology Center at first for their own use.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:57.360]   This was what the Worldwide Technology Engineers used to build proofs of concept and pilots
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.040]   in the sandbox so customers can choose the best solutions.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.360]   They can see how they interact with their existing solutions, things like that.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.720]   And it really has been a boon to Worldwide Technology.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:13.160]   They're in their beta testing, new solutions based on the latest and greatest HPE technologies.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.400]   But it is now something you can use as well.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.080]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:26.440]   Over the 10 years it's grown like Topsy, $500 million worth of equipment from big OEMs
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:32.880]   and key partners like HPE and Intel to disruptors like Equinix, all in these racks.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.360]   By the way, they're beautiful.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.640]   I don't think they let us film it.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.880]   I wish we could have.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.560]   Because if you saw this, it would blow your mind.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.560]   But now you can use it, which is really cool.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.800]   ATC is now online.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.000]   They created this lab as a service.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.320]   It's a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center where you can do your own
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:01.280]   programmatic testing using this half billion dollar ecosystem that WWT has built.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.640]   Completely virtual, you don't have to go to St. Louis.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.440]   You can use it any time of the day or night, anywhere in the world.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:14.000]   You can, there are schedulable and on-demand labs like HPE's Primera Storage Lab, along
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.680]   with hundreds of other labs representing the newest advances in cloud-based machine learning
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   and storage.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.960]   They cover the waterfront.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:32.080]   This is, I love their philosophy, which is to be in every respect your trusted partner.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.560]   Somebody that stays with you over the years, many of their customers have been with them
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.160]   for more than 10 years.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.880]   Because they know they can go to WWT to get the answers they need to make sure their business
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.400]   runs right.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.160]   I want you to give it a shot.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.400]   You can go right now to wwwt.com/twit and learn more about these enterprise technologies
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.880]   that can transform your business.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:58.440]   The ATC ecosystem creates a multiplier effect of knowledge and speed and agility anytime,
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.960]   anywhere around the world for their customers.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.240]   Not only the hands-on labs, but there's articles, there's case studies, all the tools you need
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:12.080]   to understand what's happening in this enterprise world is changing so rapidly and to take it
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.200]   and turn it to your advantage.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.760]   To learn more and discover why organizations across industries turn to WWT to guide them
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   on their digital transformation, visit www.t.com/twit.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.720]   Create that MyWWT account.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.640]   You can access all those resources right away.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.880]   WWT's Advanced Technology Center ecosystem is there for you.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.520]   www.t.com/twit.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.280]   Worldwide technology.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.960]   Delivering business and technology outcomes around the world, all from their home in St.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.560]   Louis, and Lisa has already told me the first place we're going to go after COVID is out
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:58.840]   to St. Louis to say hi to all those folks at WWT.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.400]   I think we could stop talking about Facebook now.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.240]   Yes, yes.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:08.120]   Hello, Dream Come True.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.960]   After the election, I thought, "Well, we don't have to talk about Trump anymore, but that
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.480]   did not come true."
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.600]   I know what I want to talk about.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:23.240]   Perseverance, how many show of hands did you all go on Thursday morning or Thursday afternoon
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:31.680]   for you guys and watch the amazing pictures from JPL of the second Mars rover, Perseverance,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:37.920]   landing on Mars, using that crazy sky crane technology.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   In fact, this is one of the first images.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.040]   Images came back so quickly.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   It was really cool.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.480]   This is one of the images from the sky crane looking down.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:53.720]   It's flying above the surface of Mars about six feet up, or I'm sorry, 20 meters up, and
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   the Perseverance is on these cables as it lowers it to the surface of Mars, then Perseverance
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:05.240]   releases the cables and the sky crane flies off to its destruction elsewhere on Mars.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:12.280]   There is a Linux-driven helicopter that's going to be exploring the surface of Mars,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.380]   four feet dual rotors because of the thin air, and it's running on Linux, which some
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:23.080]   WAG pointed out makes Linux now the number two operating system on two planets in the
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:28.640]   solar system.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.000]   That cheered me up immensely.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.200]   That just made me feel like, you know, sure, there's troubles on Earth.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.920]   But we also have amazing ability.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.720]   There are, in fact, three different countries, China, the UAE, and now the United States,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.480]   who are visiting Mars.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:54.120]   Monday, we expect to get video footage, including the first sounds from Mars.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.960]   I was fooled.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   I'll admit it.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.320]   We're in over to Lisa.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.120]   Lisa, listen, we've got sound from Mars.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.080]   Some WAG had taken curiosity pictures, stitched them together, and put some unknown sound
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.800]   behind it, and tweeted it, and it fooled me.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.480]   So that wasn't it, but yeah, I know.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:18.840]   Right when it was landing, I also got into sound from space Twitter and was listening
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.200]   to recordings from Venus.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.120]   Although, now that I say it, didn't do that much research into it.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.240]   So I guess they could have also been fake, but it seemed very legitimate on Twitter, at
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   least.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.960]   Yeah, it snopes debunked mine.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.400]   Is this real audio from Mars?
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.080]   Because I know the reason I believe it is I knew that we were going to get audio from
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.520]   Perseverance, but this isn't it.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.360]   Okay, yes.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.680]   The sounds from Venus, correct.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.600]   It is the Veneera 14 and Veneera 13.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   So we did send a microphone to Venus.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.320]   We're recording right before the machine dissolved, burst into flame, and forgetting exactly
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:09.400]   what way it was destroyed, but Venus was too hot, but it certainly sounded that way.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.200]   I probably should have realized if I looked more closely, this is contact media literacy
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.480]   in a nutshell.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:23.920]   But the tweet was from anonymous that this is not sound from Mars.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.400]   Oh man, 21.5 million views.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:34.280]   I think that I'm not the only one who has fooled.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   I just feel like, sorry, I was just going to say, I feel like it's so depressing here
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.040]   on Earth in so many ways.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.800]   Like you re-climate change news and it's terrible.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:54.000]   And I just feel like what I loved about this story is it showed what amazing things we
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.240]   can do when we set a goal and we work for things that are greater than our own petty
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.240]   differences.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.320]   And it's so inspirational.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.480]   You think back historically what happened when we landed on the moon, the United States
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.080]   had just been tearing itself apart at the time.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:18.200]   And it was a very stressful time and it was a moment of hope.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.000]   And that's exactly how I felt watching this.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.800]   I just felt good for the first time and a long time.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   I did.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.200]   I felt inspired and then I started thinking about all the seasons of the expanse that
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.080]   I just finished watching, which is basically about how we just take all of our petty problems
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   and put them in space.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.040]   Earth Mars, the Belters and the Outer Planet Alliance, all of each other's cities.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   Earth's throats.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   That's the future.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   Sorry.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.040]   Such a donor.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.080]   No, it's true.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.160]   It's probably true that we will carry with us all our flaws.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.320]   But that's kind of one of the most amazing things about humans.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:00.640]   At the same time as we are horrible, we're also beautiful and amazing.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.200]   And it's kind of all at the same time.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.040]   It's a very, it's interesting being a human, isn't it?
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   We've got flaws.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.080]   But our flaws are also on Mars.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.640]   So I guess that's- There you go.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.640]   There you go.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.960]   We should point out my friend Daniel Suarez, who has written many science fiction books,
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.880]   said that you really don't want to live on Mars.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.880]   It's really, really inhospitable.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   Really?
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.080]   It looks so easy in the Mars?
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.200]   It looks like Arizona.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.560]   How hard could that be?
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.360]   Turns out the regolith, the very, very, very fine dust that covers Mars, would actually
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.200]   kill you almost instantly if you got any of it in your lungs.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   So don't.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.040]   I was going to move to Mars and now I'm not.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.840]   Well, you're telling me the 2011 Pixar film Mars Needs Moms lied to me?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.640]   Yeah, no, it's not true.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   Really?
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   I saw Mars Needs Women.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.960]   I didn't know about Mars Needs Moms.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.440]   Apparently, it's not Pixar.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   I just looked it up.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   It's Walt Disney Pictures.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.440]   Close.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.440]   Mars Needs Moms.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   You got something you can watch tonight.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   On your love and heart of 3D computer animated science fiction film.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:20.720]   Elon Musk says he is going to build 100 capsules for humans to go to Mars in the next couple
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   of years.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.160]   Elon Musk's so good, Elon.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.680]   Yeah, he really does.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:35.560]   He is funding with SpaceX, which is also not SpaceX Starlink, which is SpaceX's other project,
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.760]   the one to put internet on every corner of the earth.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.760]   That actually is coming along.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:45.720]   We're getting close to being able to, you could pre-order space Starlink now and not
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.320]   SpaceX Starlink now.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.000]   $400 for the equipment, $99 a month.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.080]   It's going to top out at about 150 megabits, so I don't know if it's going to be the best
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.560]   internet you've ever had for that price.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.560]   But it's kind of cool.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:07.480]   It could certainly make a big difference for people in most of the country where you can't
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.880]   get even a fraction of those speeds.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.200]   Yeah, but they're not going to pay 99 bucks.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.560]   I suppose he'll have a, I presume they'll have some sort of inexpensive version, right?
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.920]   One would hope.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:27.840]   I mean, I feel like this is a story that is not covered the way that it needs to be.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:33.560]   Like even here in Massachusetts, people think like we're like a high tech city because,
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.120]   you know, for biotech industry and MIT and Harvard and all of that.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:43.240]   But Western Mass has massive problems with lack of access to internet access out there.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.920]   My home state of Mississippi, the exact same thing.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:51.000]   If you get up there to the Delta or even just outside of Oxford, there are huge parts of
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.200]   the United States where it's really, I almost want to use the word.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   I mean, it's abusive, the pricing practices that they have for like satellite internet.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.680]   So fully support the goal.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.440]   You know, I think it's good to see someone working on this because God knows our governor
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.720]   of Massachusetts isn't.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:15.320]   Well, thank goodness Comcast dropped its data cap enforcement.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:21.040]   They were going to enforce data caps in the 12 remaining states that didn't have them
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.320]   in 2021.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.360]   And I guess Massachusetts is one of the places where they're not going to have those data
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   caps.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.080]   So you saying that they have data caps for all those other states, generally speaking?
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.760]   It makes no sense.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:40.880]   You know, one of the things we learned in 2020 was you don't need data caps.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.880]   You know, they took them off and nothing went wrong.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.880]   Nothing collapsed.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.280]   It all was fine.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.280]   More people at home, everybody's zoom in, everybody working from home and it still was
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   fine.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.960]   But think of the shareholders, Leo.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:59.080]   How are they going to get all of the money they can if, you know, people are using internet
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   at paying out a nose for it and not, you know, think of the shareholders.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.120]   I think it's going to be so interesting to see post COVID.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.960]   So many companies have said now you can work from anywhere and there's this democratization
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.200]   of where the workforce can live.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.240]   But that will be limited by this problem.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.960]   If you're like a doctor trying to participate in telemedicine, but you don't have fast
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.520]   uplink because you're on a satellite connection, you can't do it.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:33.920]   So I wonder, I wonder if over the next few years as, you know, Oracle or Salesforce is
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:40.040]   like, no, no, please go work from, you know, Alaska or rural Maine and then their employees
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.880]   are like, well, actually I can't.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.280]   So you can't pay me less to work in a more romantic area because I can't do the work.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.480]   This will start to if those economic pressures will change.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.640]   Yeah, well, if you can't get internet, there's no point in it, which is too bad because the
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.000]   least expensive places to live are the ones that have the worst internet.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.440]   So I guess you're going to have to pay a little bit.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:07.280]   But yeah, Spotify joined the ranks of companies who are saying not just during quarantine,
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.600]   but going forward, we're going to let our employees work from home.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.300]   Spotify says, by the way, they'll pay you the same no matter where you live, which only
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.720]   makes sense to me.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.720]   I don't understand.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.320]   I mean, employees doing a certain amount of work, they're worth a certain amount of money.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.600]   What do you care if the living in Vermont or San Francisco?
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.360]   I don't understand why that should make any difference.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:30.440]   Well, it depends on, but it'll be interesting to see if they will pay the same amount of
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.200]   money if they hire.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   After the fact, yeah.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.800]   Yes, that if the hiring price for somebody in a less populated region will be lower, I
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   suspect that it'll be cheaper to hire people elsewhere for a while.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:49.220]   And then eventually, maybe this will all kind of sort itself out and it really will cost
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:53.540]   the same amount of money to hire an entry level software engineer.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.300]   Is it the, I don't know, you're a boss.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   Maybe you can tell me.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:03.060]   Is it the fact that at first, I mean, I remember as a boss, I didn't want my employees to
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.820]   work from home because I figured they're screwing off.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.300]   So I wanted to, it's that Henry Ford mentality.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.420]   I want to be able to see him in the cube farms and make sure that they're working.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.420]   Damn it.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.320]   You know, actually it's more like Bob Cratchitt and Scrooge, right?
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.200]   Get it, get there and work.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.400]   And then all long comes quarantine.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.040]   People are still, the job's still getting done.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.840]   People aren't coming into work, saves me money.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.680]   I might not have to rent that big office downtown San Francisco.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.400]   I may not, you know, I mean, that's going to be, might be good for companies.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:36.640]   Shopify has announced that the nine to five workday is dead.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   That was sales force.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.720]   Shopify says Shopify did make a similar.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.420]   Yeah, all five thousand employees can work from home forever indefinitely.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:48.260]   And they're worried about.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.260]   What are you worried about?
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.260]   Because you're a boss.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.460]   Are you going to let those slackers go home and work from home?
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:59.740]   I'm actually legitimately worried about people working too much.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.980]   And it's the other problem.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:04.660]   That sounds sort of nutty, but I am truly worried about burnout.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:10.700]   I'm worried that when you don't have a physical end to your day, it is much harder to do.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.700]   Just stop.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.700]   That's a really good point.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.800]   To figure out where to draw the boundaries.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.000]   And I think that a lot of people are starting to experience that toward the end of this
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   year.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.440]   People have been working very, very hard for very good reasons and it has benefited,
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.200]   you know, everybody in a lot of ways are starting to feel a little ragged.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.000]   And I think if everybody's working from home all the time, we've got to help people establish
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   some barriers.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.080]   I also worry about we have some employees that are living alone.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.940]   So they are, I mean, their social life was coming in here and having, you know, the
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:46.640]   birthday cake for whoever's birthday it was this week and we'd have lunches and stuff
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   every Wednesday.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.040]   We'd have lunch in the studios.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.640]   And I worry about there's one employee.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:57.720]   I'm not going to name names, but he joins our Zoom staff meetings now lying on a pillow,
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   lying down.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   He's on.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.720]   He's in bed.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.720]   You can't believe you're calling out your boys like this.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.720]   He knows who he is.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.720]   He's in bed.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   He's in bed like this.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   It's okay.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:14.880]   That's, you know, there's a lot of, there are editors at my job that come in fully horizontal.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.560]   And I think more power to you.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.120]   You can enter a meeting fully horizontal that I wish I had that kind of cop.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.160]   Now the chat room's guessing who it is.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.840]   No, we, I, it's not that I don't love our employees.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.000]   I worry about them.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.640]   I feel like, gosh, I hope they don't go off the deep end because they're, they're, they're
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.240]   not talking to anybody.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   Right?
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.240]   That's good.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   I don't know.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.080]   I almost believe in a, in a hybrid model for this.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:48.480]   I mean, when I think about the really great, extremely difficult engineering things that
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   I've like tackled with the team in my career, you know, servers melting down, trying to
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:58.040]   get something patch this very, very difficult.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:03.480]   All of that was like sitting in a room with other people on my team, diagramming things
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:10.320]   out, really feeling that trust and really feeling heard in a way that you can only do
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.600]   when you're there physically together.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.720]   And I mean, you know, I, I just, I feel like there's a limit in, you know, like rebellion
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.640]   pack were all virtual right now.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:25.520]   My game studio, we were all virtual.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:31.400]   My congressional campaign, we were all virtual, but we also had policies in place that we
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:36.560]   would make sure that we had a physical in person meeting about once a week.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.560]   That's a good idea.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:43.680]   And I've really found that to be so key because without that, you're, there's just something
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.080]   missing from Zoom.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.320]   It just, it doesn't, it's, it's not the same.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.720]   I agree 100%.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:56.600]   So I just, I mean, maybe there are some companies that can work with people moving all around
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:01.720]   the country to where it's cheapest, but I just, I, I just really wonder if that's going to
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:08.120]   be how the really best products are made or the really toughest challenges are solved.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   It's kind of ironic that Salesforce was just built a giant tower in downtown San Francisco
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:19.040]   at what must have been hundreds of millions of dollars has, has declared the nine to five
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.200]   work to force dead.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.800]   And I am fascinated by this.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800]   And I really just built that.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.840]   They didn't even get to open the little tram.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.720]   So where's the tram go?
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:38.480]   It kind of goes down from the, from the transit hub to the plaza outside the tower.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.280]   It's also, and you were in San Francisco.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:45.200]   So you can tell me, do they have strippers dancing in the roof?
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   What is going on?
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.840]   I've never been in that room.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.240]   A number of people from my staff went up there when it opened and toured it.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.160]   There were no strippers when they went up there.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.040]   So just so people know, I probably could find a video of it.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:04.160]   The top of the Salesforce tower, which frankly is a giant phallus, has is lit in a weird
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.460]   way.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:11.680]   And there are people, giant 30 foot people dancing in it many evenings.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.760]   Sometimes.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.080]   And I'm told there are different videos that play out.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   Oh, they're videos.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.080]   Because originally wasn't there a spot they were going to, there's a club in San Francisco.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.720]   Have you ever been to Bimbo's 365?
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.520]   It's one of my favorite places.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.600]   I've seen many concerts and shows there.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.800]   It has behind the bar a fish tank.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.360]   And in the fish tank, there is on special nights.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.480]   They don't do it all the time anymore.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.440]   But there used to be when it was like all the rage, you know, in Sinatra era, a naked
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.960]   woman swim a mermaid swimming like, but she's live, but she's a foot long.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.080]   She's tiny.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.880]   And it turns out there was a mirror contraption going to the basement and there was some poor
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.240]   woman on a chair, naked swimming like that.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.480]   And it would be reflected up into the tank.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.160]   And I've seen this, by the way, it's wild.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.960]   And that's all I could think of with the Salesforce tower is that there is somebody
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.160]   in the basement dancing.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160]   Oh, no.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.600]   Isn't that how it works?
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.560]   I feel like I can't even talk about the Salesforce tower because all of my conversations
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:25.000]   about the Salesforce tower at home is so inappropriate for this year.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.480]   Here for your Delectation, those of you watching at home who don't believe me is video from
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.120]   Channel 2, our local new one of our local news stations.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.800]   That is about 30 feet tall.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.720]   That's each of those divisions is a floor.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:44.960]   So she's one, two, three, four, five, six stories tall.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.120]   And it sure looks live.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.960]   Look, here comes somebody else.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.280]   Oh, it does look live.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.240]   I always thought it was recording.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.160]   It's bizarre and it is the top of the giant penis.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.560]   So it's even weirder.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.560]   What?
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.320]   I don't like that at all.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.320]   I don't.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   I don't.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   It is.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.600]   It is from, you know, I used to live in San Francisco for years.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   I love San Francisco.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.960]   I don't know what's happened to it, but it's ruined to me.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.800]   It's ruined the skyline is what is where there are dancers in this.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.640]   So that building is from my office, and I barely remember what it's like to sit in my office,
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.680]   but from my office, you can, I have a direct line of sight to the sales for building and
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.160]   at about 5 p.m. during certain parts of the year, the reflection off the side of that
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.520]   building literally blind me.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.520]   Like I'd have to get up and leave my office.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.320]   I'm not surprised.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   So right.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.800]   Here's a picture.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.340]   This is the classic San Francisco skyline, the Trans America pyramid, the beautiful
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:44.020]   Coit Tower, and in the middle of it, this thing.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.460]   Why?
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.700]   I blame Mark Benny off.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.660]   This is what happens when you have too much money.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.940]   Anyway, I don't.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.340]   So salesforce owns a huge amount of real estate in downtown San Francisco.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.780]   It's not just the salesforce tower.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.620]   There are a lot of other buildings around the salesforce tower that are full of salesforce
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.620]   people or were.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.620]   Wow.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.700]   And I would kind of assume, although I do not know that everything is going to retract
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:08.700]   to that tower.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.980]   If that maybe just the tip.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:19.740]   Maybe just maybe the tall people as long as the tower doesn't retract.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.140]   But I'm sorry.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.860]   I can see now why the conversations around your house are a little.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.060]   It's just like we can't even talk about it anymore.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.260]   I suddenly understand.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.300]   Forget I mentioned it.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:38.980]   But there is a larger question, which is what happens to these company towns if people are
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:45.380]   no longer working there that undermines everything, the tax structure.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.820]   A city is only safe.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.100]   You know, New York safe because there's people walking around all the time.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.660]   If those streets are deserted, it gets a little scary.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660]   Isn't that right, Paris?
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.260]   You live in Brooklyn, right?
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.620]   People are still walking around everywhere here.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.620]   Good.
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:06.740]   I mean, obviously the density has changed, but safety and whatnot has not really.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.460]   Is the case if I feel like when you're in a city, if there's a lot of foot traffic, that's
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.460]   good.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.940]   That makes it safer.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940]   Yes.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940]   I guess.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:19.540]   I mean, I'd say, yeah, foot traffic, obviously good.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:24.020]   There's the balance because of the bystander effect, the technically, even though we feel
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.020]   safer.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.820]   If someone, let's say, is having a heart attack or something in the middle of a busy
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:36.300]   street, no one will go and help them or call 911 because they think somebody else will.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.740]   But that's a different point.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.580]   Yeah, generally it's better to be in a place where a lot of people are.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:47.580]   I was told if you're getting assaulted in a city, you don't shout, I'm getting beat
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:51.020]   up, you shout fire because everybody's interested in a fire.
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:55.460]   And I won't come over to see the fire.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.460]   That makes sense.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.460]   Oh, I like this.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460]   No?
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.460]   Okay.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.940]   I've heard a lot about this, Leo.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.940]   There's something wrong with me.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.860]   I think it's I've been spending too much time on the life alert.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.540]   I'm the guy on the pillow in the Zoom meetings.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.700]   I can admit it now.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:14.540]   It seems like a simple, a simple help would do the job.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.540]   Hopefully you would think.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.980]   But apparently maybe not in Brooklyn help.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.180]   I'm having a heart attack.
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.700]   No, but if you say fire, people come running over to see the fire.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.700]   I'm not kidding.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   All right.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.580]   I want to take a break because it's just going downhill and it's all my fault.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.580]   I totally apologize.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.580]   The sales force towers fault, really.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.580]   It is.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.580]   It is.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.060]   I blame you, Mark Benioff.
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.140]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.900]   In fact, nowadays, one of the places you probably don't want to go a lot to.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.060]   I haven't checked my post office box since last March.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.940]   I'm a little nervous because it's only about, yeah, big.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.020]   And I know it's going to be I'm going to open it up and it's going to go cascading out
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.620]   like crazy.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.620]   But I love the post office.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.180]   I got a post office box because I like going in there waving at the people.
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.300]   The last thing you need to do though, if you need stamps, if you need to mail packages,
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:11.700]   is go to the post office, you can do it all from your desk with your computer, with your
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   printer, which is amazing.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:23.860]   Stamps.com legal US postage printed right from your computer on demand 24/7.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.860]   You can send letters.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.980]   In fact, you can print right on the envelope if you're sending out bills or brochures or
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980]   something.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.820]   You can print right on the envelope your company logo, your return address and the recipients
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   address.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.860]   In fact, it even pulls that from your address book or your spreadsheet or your website.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.580]   So no time typing.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.420]   It's always accurate.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.060]   Stamps.com always prints exactly the right postage effect.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.580]   They're going to give you a USB scale.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.020]   So there's never any question.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.060]   You could ship packages.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:54.460]   You know, one of the things I buy stuff on Etsy, my wife does.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:58.140]   And every once in a while, we get a package from Etsy that's practically like a six-year-old
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:04.380]   is tied with twine and there's 50 stamps, obviously licked on there, all different kinds,
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.820]   criss-crossed upside.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.380]   It doesn't project the best impression.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.780]   Plus, it's a lot of trouble on your part.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.500]   When you have stamps.com, it prints out the label.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.460]   It automatically fills in all the forms.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:23.340]   If you want priority mail or confirmation, that kind of thing.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.900]   If you're printing out, you're sending overseas customs forms, it does that automatically.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.060]   And by the way, now it's not just the United States Postal Service.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060]   It's also UPS.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.260]   They've made a deal with UPS.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.260]   Yes.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.780]   So with stamps.com, you get the most of the post office and UPS.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.980]   I mean, it's the one stop for mailing.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:46.140]   If you're a seller on Amazon, Etsy, eBay, big discounts too, up to 40% off post office
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.740]   rates, up to 62% off UPS rates.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.100]   For example, UPS normally when you send to a residence, I didn't even know this, there's
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:58.340]   a residential search charge, I can't remember what it's like, five bucks, they've waived
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.340]   that.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.660]   So you're going to, this is, it's a no-brainer.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.340]   You need to use stamps.com, whether you're a small office, sending out invoices, an online
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:11.180]   seller shipping out orders, even a giant warehouse, sending thousands of packages a day.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.900]   Stamps.com can handle it with ease.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:20.420]   Official US postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail, UPS, it does it all.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.300]   Stamps.com, we've been using them for almost a decade now.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.380]   What are you waiting for?
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.740]   I mean, it's the only way we go.
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.300]   In fact, I love it because we need stamps.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.580]   I just call up and I say, Debbie, print me some stamps, leave it in the drawer and I
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.660]   get some stamps and I'm done.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.540]   I don't have to go to the post office.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.700]   Stop wasting time in line at the post office, looking for parking, all that stuff.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.660]   It's safe, it's easy and it really works.

[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.020]   We had a very nice week on TWIT this week.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:26.380]   I wanted to show you, you got it, John, a little movie compilation we made of some of
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.380]   the best moments.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.380]   Watch the cynical.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.900]   Wait a minute, Stacy's eating waffles.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.380]   Did you bring enough for the whole podcast?
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.340]   I muted my mic and everything.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:40.860]   Yeah, but I happened to look eat or savory.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:44.140]   Previously on TWIT, Windows Weekly.
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:48.540]   A story that came out in the financial time to said Microsoft approached Pinterest quote
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.700]   in recent months about acquiring the company even though it wasn't for sale.
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.580]   The big question is why?
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.580]   Why?
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.700]   This week in Enterprise Tech, not only has the M1 made a significant impact in the market,
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:04.260]   but has also caught the interest of hackers as well, especially the ethical research kind.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:10.140]   A couple months after M1 was released, most of this code is already natively on the platforms,
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.860]   all about Android.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.580]   Android Auto and Android Automotive, it's ridiculously confusing.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:21.580]   Both Android Auto and CarPlay do is it's just acting as an interface layer between your
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.100]   phone and the car.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.940]   All the apps and everything are actually running on your phone.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.860]   Android Automotive is actually a full operating system.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.300]   So that's the operating system that powers your infotainment system in the car.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.700]   This week in Google.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:39.020]   It's a stroke time, everybody get an upper stroke.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.540]   No, I know, this was a conspiracy.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.540]   You said to Stacy.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.620]   Just when Jeff starts going off, start eating the waffles.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.980]   Hey, I think we should add our whole theme song, "Twit."
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.060]   Now is the time when we threw a waffle on twig.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.060]   Waffle dance?
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.060]   That's my lovey name.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.060]   Waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle.
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.460]   Or you could hashtag waffle.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.460]   I tried.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:05.180]   We never did get that waffle theme song, but maybe it's not too late.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.500]   I thought that was an interesting story.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.700]   I don't know how true it was that Microsoft was looking at Pinterest and approached them
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.100]   about a takeover.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:17.740]   It did come from the Financial Times, which is, I think, a pretty reliable source.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.740]   The client.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.740]   They were reliable.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   Fairly so, right?
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:28.780]   According to the Financial Times, they were offering $51 billion for Pinterest.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:31.300]   They had all the TikTok money.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.300]   What?
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.300]   They didn't know where they needed the success.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   Oh, that's right.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.300]   That's right.
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.300]   They were ready to bid on TikTok.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.300]   Didn't get a chance.
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.220]   By the way, I misreported that TikTok story.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.180]   I'll go back to Pinterest a second, but I want to correct something because we had
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:51.540]   thought that the TikTok acquisition sale thing was dead, that the president was not interested
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.100]   in it, that this was a passion project for the previous president.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.300]   Actually, that's not the case.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.260]   CFIUS is still investigating it.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.180]   The Committee on Foreign Investments in the US and no decision has been made.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.300]   It's still in limbo, this TikTok acquisition by.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.660]   It would not now be Microsoft.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.780]   It would be Oracle and Walmart.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.780]   You're right.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.460]   Maybe Microsoft, they've been saving their pennies.
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.060]   They have a few and they thought, "What else could we get?
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.060]   Why would they, Paris?
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.020]   Why would they want Pinterest?"
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   I'm forgetting the exact number, but Pinterest has a lot of daily active users, more so
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.020]   than Twitter is.
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:33.340]   I think I like to remind myself whenever I spend too much time thinking about the Bluebird
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.860]   app.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.140]   It's actually, Pinterest is a big social message.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:39.980]   - And while I guess- - And while I guess-
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.820]   - Am then paragraph. - And while I guess-
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.160]   - In 59 million monthly active users,
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.300]   450 million. - Well, and yeah.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.840]   Think about who those users are
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.180]   and what they're doing.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.000]   A lot of those users are for instance,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.360]   like my architect, sending me links to pin boards,
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.400]   the things- - Stuff you should buy.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   - That I, - The buy, yeah.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.520]   - Stuff you should buy.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.120]   A huge amount of activity on Pinterest is about stuff,
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.620]   and stuff is how you make money.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.860]   - Yeah, I mean, Microsoft has a kind of laggard ad platform.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:07.700]   We don't ever talk.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.100]   We talk about Amazon being,
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.500]   is not exactly in that list.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.100]   We talk about Google, we talk about Facebook.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:17.460]   Nobody says, "Oh, the Bing ad platform, that's huge."
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.900]   They'd like to make it huge.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.940]   And wow, what a signal.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:26.020]   What, 459 million monthly users telling you literally
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.780]   what they wanna buy.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.340]   - Yeah, I can see that. - Yeah, I can see that.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.660]   - I can see that.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.300]   I don't know, it's like, you know,
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.100]   if Microsoft, their stock is up so much this year,
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.660]   like they're really doing well.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.140]   And I think about like their liquid data strategy,
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.220]   that makes sense to me.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:44.020]   You look at their innovation with like documents,
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.580]   with, was it the stacks technology that they're bringing out,
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.660]   or all this stuff they're bringing out for Office 2021.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.420]   That all makes sense to me.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.900]   Buying Pinterest makes exactly as much sense
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.740]   as buying TikTok.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:13:59.620]   It made to me.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.940]   It just, maybe there's that like larger data aggregation case
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.140]   for it, but it just, it feels like,
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.260]   Microsoft is doing so well in this era
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.820]   since they got rid of Ballmer.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.900]   Like they're really, they've got a vision for the company.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.220]   - No kidding.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.660]   - You know, Azure is just absolutely amazing.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:22.580]   And I just, I mean, it just, it, it,
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.220]   it doesn't feel like it makes sense
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.900]   with the larger business strategy.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.180]   Does that make sense?
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:30.580]   - They spent, this would be the large,
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.180]   they, this is, they spent like three billion for Nokia.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.420]   LinkedIn was 27 billion, half this amount.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.540]   GitHub a fraction of the amount.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.300]   Minecraft a fraction of the amount.
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.900]   This would be a huge, 51 billion dollars.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.580]   - Maybe it becomes the ad platform.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.780]   - That may be.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.180]   Paris, you were gonna say something, I'm sorry,
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.020]   I cut you off.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.980]   - Yeah, I think that, I mean, that point is really valid.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:59.100]   I think that there's a lot that they could do with Pinterest.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.860]   And still out generally that any sort of company
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.740]   kind of could do to a platform like Pinterest.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.220]   I mean, it's great.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.060]   It serves the purpose as you were talking about,
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:13.060]   Lindsey of kind of this visual sharing vision board network,
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.540]   specifically for buying stuff,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:18.500]   but it doesn't have the e-commerce integrations
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:23.500]   that Instagram or Facebook or TikTok even TikTok,
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.420]   I guess is trialing e-commerce integrations.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:31.220]   But Pinterest, I guess from a purely profit based standpoint
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:36.220]   could be taken up a notch in order to kind of facilitate
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.180]   transactions and monetize them in a way that it currently doesn't.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.180]   - Isn't that what you're looking for?
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:44.140]   If you're a value investor is something that could be made
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.300]   even more valuable by an acquisition.
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.220]   I'm looking at my Pinterest board
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:52.100]   and apparently Pinterest thinks all I wanna do is eat and drink.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.940]   - Is that not true?
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:58.500]   - And play the drums and have a double monitor?
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.420]   - We say that at the same time. (laughs)
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   - Apparently it's a dead giveaway,
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:07.580]   but what's great about this is there are ads in here.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:11.220]   This is an ad and there are a lot of ads in here
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:15.460]   and you just, but it looks just like more of your content.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.140]   I think this has all of the appeal of Instagram
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.740]   and all of the value Instagram ads are incredibly valuable.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.180]   - That's exactly what I was gonna say,
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.460]   which is that this looks like it's almost as good
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.500]   as what Instagram is doing, but it has room for improvement
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.380]   and that is exactly when you buy something.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.220]   Especially if to your point, Branna,
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.580]   the corporate culture isn't a good spot at Microsoft.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.220]   They feel like they've got management structured down
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.180]   and a really good set of tactics for turning things around.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.500]   That's when you buy something like that.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.260]   I can say that.
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:49.220]   - Maybe I should try to buy it. (laughs)
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.420]   Look, we'll put a little group together.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.180]   - Gather some dollars.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.180]   - Gather some bucks.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.020]   - Gather some bucks.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.100]   - I got some Bitcoin I've been sitting on.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.300]   - Oh my God, my Bitcoins were so much.
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.140]   It's ridiculous.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.380]   - 57, what is it now?
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.220]   - I'm crazy.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.060]   - Is it 47, that?
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.900]   What is BTC?
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:08.740]   Let me look real quick.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:11.740]   - The last I looked, it was 50, it was close to 56.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:12.580]   - 57.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.420]   - It's probably gone up.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.260]   - 57, 450.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.220]   I actually, this is how that got.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.220]   I have now a command line script I can hit with command space
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.780]   and see what the Bitcoin value is.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:24.180]   - Oh, that's your ad.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.020]   - Right away.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.820]   No waiting.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.940]   - When I heard Tesla, and Elon talking about this,
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:34.020]   I said, "If you like to do momentum investing,
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:38.500]   it's always a good bet to not invest with advice,
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.860]   but generally speaking, when Elon tweets about something,
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:41.700]   it goes up."
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:45.220]   And when Elon announced that Tesla was going to buy
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.980]   this huge stake in Bitcoin, which, let's just say,
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:51.420]   it's an environmental nightmare, but all the same.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.260]   It was what?
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.980]   It was like 46, 48 at that point.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.700]   And now it's gone up $10,000 in just a couple of weeks.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.020]   It's stunning.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.740]   - Some of that because Elon Musk's Tesla bought
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:07.380]   one and a half billion dollars of Bitcoin.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.860]   So that's Elon saying it's undervalued,
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.300]   it's going to go up, so we're investing.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.980]   I guess, I don't know why he did.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.980]   Although, Elon is a little confusing,
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.540]   because a couple of days ago he tweeted,
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.580]   Bitcoin seems a little high now.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:24.340]   So that's a dumb thing to do right after you buy a lot of it.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.820]   Elon, it's going to pass long trading strategy there.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:32.500]   You don't, you don't, you pump the stock after you buy it.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.980]   You don't downplay it.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.420]   Maybe he shorted it at the same time, I don't know.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.660]   - He was hyping up Dogecoin last week.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:43.900]   - Yes, and he helped Dogecoin quite a bit.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.740]   - And the thing that gets me like Dogecoin
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.980]   is the fact that you can infinitely mine Dogecoins.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.420]   It's just, there's no--
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.260]   - That's a problem.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.620]   - This is what gets me.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.140]   - That's inflationary.
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.300]   - It's inflationary and there's no future.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.340]   I can imagine where Dogecoin was something people actually
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.700]   used to buy something.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.420]   It's a speculative currency.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.420]   - Wait a minute.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.260]   - That's why there's no coins.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.100]   - Dogecoin?
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.100]   - Dogecoin?
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.220]   - I do think so, absolutely.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.860]   You know, Bitcoin has alliances with MasterCard
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:14.820]   and things like that for you to be able to more freely buy things.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.740]   - How much Bitcoin do you have?
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.940]   - So this is a true story.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.660]   When I was running for office,
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.460]   people were asking me, well, my position was,
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.500]   I'm Bitcoin, I never used it.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.460]   And I bought like 300 bucks of it on a lark,
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.140]   which is worth, I looked at my Coinbase wall
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.580]   at the other day, it's worth a lot of money.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.380]   And I've occasionally asked myself,
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:38.340]   like, maybe I go buy a new car with that money.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.700]   It's just crazy, you know?
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.820]   - Here's the question.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:42.940]   You look at it, you see that, you know,
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.420]   I have 7.85 Bitcoin.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.500]   I can't get to it.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.340]   - Wow.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.180]   - Well, I don't remember the password,
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.540]   but I have the wallet.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.940]   - Oh, oh.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:51.780]   - I'll find the password.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.260]   - Do you have the promise of--
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.980]   - I have almost half a million dollars in Bitcoin.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:56.820]   - Oh my God.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.300]   - In a way, I'm glad I don't have the password.
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.420]   I would be going crazy right now, should I sell it?
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:03.460]   Should I buy, what should I do?
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.260]   Maybe it's gonna go to a million bucks at coin.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.100]   I don't know.
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:10.660]   I don't wanna be the guy who bought a pizza for 22,000 Bitcoin.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.500]   - I will say, I've got a,
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500]   all of this talk makes me incredibly depressed
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.420]   because 10 years ago,
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:21.500]   I bought a pizza among other things using Bitcoin.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.340]   - What?
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:25.300]   - What would be worth so much now?
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.700]   - How much did that pizza cost you?
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:27.540]   Do you remember?
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:30.020]   - I mean, I think--
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.340]   - Oh my God.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.020]   - I remember buying a little Bitcoin.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.340]   Like there were at least three Bitcoin involved
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.580]   in the transaction.
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.460]   - A hundred fifty thousand dollar pizza.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.420]   - I know Leo, I know.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.420]   (laughs)
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.900]   I think about it frequently.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:48.580]   There's also some crumbs of those Bitcoin
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:50.180]   that were attached to a Coinbase account
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.220]   that I cannot, for the life of me,
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.500]   remember any information about and it's just crumbs me.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.100]   - That's my problem.
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:01.140]   I was smart enough, I did everything right, almost.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.900]   (laughs)
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.620]   I was smart enough to back up the wallet.dad file.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.980]   So I always, I have a copy of it.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.180]   I was smart enough to password protect it.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.220]   The one mistake I didn't write down
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.700]   or record in any way the password.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.580]   I've been, I keep looking at my last pass thinking,
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.300]   maybe I called it something else.
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.140]   Maybe I, it's not there.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:22.980]   So what is that?
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.860]   - Is there a way you can just try to like do a hash locally
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.540]   with it and just break it that way?
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.060]   - Yeah, you know what I figure?
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.860]   I don't wanna break it 'cause it's,
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.500]   'cause you know, then I would be tempted to sell it.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.340]   Maybe I shouldn't.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.180]   I don't wanna, it's, I didn't buy it.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.420]   It was like tips.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.460]   People would tip me with Bitcoin.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.340]   So it's not like I ever had any of that money.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.140]   And I figure if it really becomes valuable,
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.740]   I then will have quantum computing
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.380]   and I could just have it be cracked
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.780]   and then I can get the money.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.900]   In fact, it's my retirement plan.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:55.820]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:56.660]   - Right?
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:57.500]   - When it,
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.500]   - I would, I have lower ethics than you do.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.820]   I would be like doing everything I could.
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.660]   Do you put that out?
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.860]   - Well, I gave it to my 26 year old son
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.580]   'cause it's driving him nuts.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:10.300]   He is really affecting him a lot more than me.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.660]   And he wants to send to some guy named Bitcoin Dave,
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.260]   who says Bitcoin Dave is an acronym, by the way,
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:23.660]   D-A-V for four different hackers who are anonymous.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.180]   Bitcoin Dave will crack your Bitcoin for a mere 10%.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.220]   I told him, I said, "Wait a minute,
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.700]   you're missing it to some anonymous hackers."
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.140]   He said, "They got great reviews in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:35.980]   "You're gonna say--"
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:38.180]   - That's like the coin star of Bitcoin.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.620]   - Yeah, give us your old Bitcoin.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.140]   - It's the Bitcoin star.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.900]   - We'll crack it.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.060]   - So I told him, "Under no circumstances
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:49.620]   are you to give Bitcoin Dave the wallet."
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.220]   - I don't know, I think about it.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.060]   - I would do it.
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.940]   - What else would you ever be?
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.460]   - Bitcoin Dave is gonna save you, Leo.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.380]   - I'd still get 90%.
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.020]   Actually, I'd have to give some to my son.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.220]   - You have 100% of nothing right now.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.940]   - I have 100% of something.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:04.780]   - But I have it.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.380]   - I have 50% of something after you cut your son in.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.860]   (both laughing)
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.700]   - True.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.980]   - This could take a nice post-COVID vacation together.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.340]   - No.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.060]   Bitcoin Dave's not here, man.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.580]   (both laughing)
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:18.700]   What Bitcoin?
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.660]   - Yeah, you don't send somebody half a million dollars,
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.380]   say, "Just give me $50,000.
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.060]   I'll give you $50,000."
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.980]   And you give me the $450,000 back.
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.260]   That is not gonna happen.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.780]   - I wonder if there's a way to put an escrow account
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.620]   or something or something?
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.540]   - There are some guys who do cracking will do escrow.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:39.180]   I said, "You can send it to them if you want."
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.880]   The problem is actually that unfortunately,
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:46.100]   the Bitcoin core software that I used actually
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.380]   did the encryption right.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.340]   So it's good strong encryption.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.820]   And I'm sure I used a good long password.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.980]   So I have to wait for quantum computing.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.660]   By the way, I may be waiting a while
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:02.140]   because it turns out quantum computing
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.820]   is not maybe as close as we had thought.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:06.940]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:11.300]   We are using our new new tech TriCaster to Elite.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.660]   How do you like it, John?
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.300]   Thumbs up.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.380]   We're learning things.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.660]   There are instant replay buttons now on our TriCaster,
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.540]   which we've got to figure out a use for.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.420]   I don't know.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:26.900]   And maybe super slow-mo.
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.420]   I don't know, we're gonna find a way to use it.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:31.780]   This thing is the most complete live production system
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.620]   on the planet.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.180]   If you watch Twitch, you know,
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.780]   ever since we started streaming video,
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.980]   we've been running on TriCaster.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.700]   I did a search for a while.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.060]   When we first started thinking about this,
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.820]   what kind of switcher we should use,
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.620]   what kind of production tools.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.220]   I settled on New Tech's TriCaster.
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:49.460]   I'm so glad I did.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.900]   I think it was partly 'cause some of the New Tech guys
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:55.140]   came from the video toaster side of the,
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.100]   and I've known them for years,
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.260]   whatever it was the right choice to make.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.540]   New Tech has completely expanded their line now.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:05.300]   They're full line of TriCasters,
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.780]   no matter which you select,
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.220]   you get an entire suite of media production capabilities
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.060]   at your fingertips.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.660]   We are using now the amazing TriCaster 2 Elite.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.780]   It's more than a live video production system.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.900]   It's more than just a switcher.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:23.140]   This is an all-encompassing digital media solution
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.100]   to create content.
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.180]   And it's not just for internet or internet streaming.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.220]   It's for mobile and television distribution,
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:33.100]   software-driven IP native technology,
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.860]   which gives you the capability, connectivity,
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:37.020]   and control you need to take on any kind of
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.860]   digital media production.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:42.380]   New Tech pioneered the NDI interface,
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.660]   and now thanks to NDI,
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:47.260]   we can do so many inputs, so much more.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:49.620]   When you consider the sheer variety of features offered,
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.180]   no other live production solution
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.860]   enables digital media workflows like the TriCaster 2 Elite.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.380]   We have LiveCall Connect on here.
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:58.780]   This is something brand new from New Tech,
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.980]   which enhances your production
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.500]   by letting you connect to anyone,
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.700]   anywhere on any device with high quality video
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]   and audio.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.780]   Doesn't matter what device, doesn't matter what software.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.820]   It works with teams in Skype and Zoom
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:12.460]   and meetings and everything.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.300]   Everything.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.060]   So that's huge for us.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.820]   We don't use it, but there's integrated live set technology.
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:21.420]   I know a lot of broadcasters like to have that nice set.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:25.180]   You can transform any location into a elaborate virtual
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.740]   environment that looks real.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:30.580]   In fact, you get full access to the premium library
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.180]   of New Tech Live set virtual sets,
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.420]   so you don't even have to design your own.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.780]   You can choose from a huge variety
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:39.020]   of simulated environments to suit your style, your brand.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.260]   Let's not leave out the Live Graphics Creator plugin,
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.340]   which lets you design animated titles, motion graphics,
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:47.020]   looping effects, and you could do it with tools
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.420]   you already know, the Adobe Creative Cloud tools
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.900]   that import them directly into your TriCaster live production
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:53.260]   system.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.900]   All our lower thirds now are done in Photoshop,
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.540]   which is great for us.
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.180]   Really helps.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.420]   Live Graphics Creator lets you produce and present spectacular
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:05.620]   live graphics faster and easier than ever before.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.700]   It's fun to watch our team because they've done the training.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.300]   And then different team members have said,
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.260]   I want to use this trick, this trick.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.140]   And so it's really fun to watch them play with the TriCaster.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:17.060]   As always has been.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:18.860]   That's one of the great things.
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:20.540]   What I like is it's reliable.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:23.620]   We use it 24/7.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:27.020]   And in all our live productions, and it's gotten more and more
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:30.300]   reliable, more robust, the TriCaster 2 Elite
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.220]   is amazing.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:32.980]   We love it.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:36.100]   Setting new standards, frankly it's better than broadcast.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:40.780]   Go to newtech, n-e-w-t-e-k.com/tricaster.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:44.260]   You can figure out which TriCaster is right for your needs.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:48.580]   They have a nice tool to help you pick your next TriCaster.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:50.620]   If you've been thinking about TriCaster,
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.860]   I couldn't encourage you more.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:57.580]   It is absolutely the technology that empowers all
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:03.380]   of what we do here at newtech.com/tricaster.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:07.580]   Thank you, NewTech, for the TriCaster 2 Elite.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.740]   It's really more than we need, John.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.220]   It's way, it's way.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.020]   Don't tell him that though.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.380]   It is so great.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.340]   And didn't they use, I think on the last streaming event,
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:25.980]   the Samsung Note 20 or Galaxy 21 event
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:32.380]   can't figure out how to use some instant replay.
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:38.180]   So he would capture the event as B-roll in the instant replay.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:41.140]   And then when we were after the event describing pieces of it,
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:45.500]   he could just push a button on the board and play back a clip.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:49.140]   Why aren't you doing that, John?
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:52.740]   It's nothing to play back, you're right.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:57.500]   Thank you, NewTech, NewTech.com/tricaster.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:03.900]   There was a big victory in quantum computing declared,
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.620]   oh, now I'm trying to find the story.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.340]   Who was it said that they had this huge--
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:13.900]   oh, Microsoft, right?
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:19.300]   Said they had a huge breakthrough in quantum computing in 2018.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:22.060]   Now they're saying, oh, never mind.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:26.700]   Oh, never mind.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.540]   I am-- if I could short quantum computing,
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.500]   I would short quantum computing at this point.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:37.060]   They had apparently observed an elusive particle
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.740]   called a major run of fermion.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.060]   And Microsoft hoped to harness those particles
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.380]   to build a quantum computer.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:48.340]   Google and IBM and others have, in fact,
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.140]   China's got a quantum computer.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.420]   And they were hopeful that this would be huge.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:59.180]   Late last month, the 22 co-authors of the paper
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:01.260]   released a new paper, including more data
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.140]   from their experiments.
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:06.780]   Turns out they did not find the major run of fermion.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.540]   It was a technical error.
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:13.660]   And I was so hopeful that they would be able to crack
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:15.820]   my Bitcoin wallet.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.820]   Did I also hear something about--
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:19.900]   I now got to Google this really fast as it's
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:23.220]   coming out of my mouth-- that IBM stopping advertising,
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:24.460]   its work on Watson?
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.300]   Well, IBM Watson--
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.860]   Watson wants to dump Watson.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.100]   Watson dumpt Watson.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:32.020]   Watson, which was originally famous.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.980]   Well, I think it was a variant of Deep Blue,
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.300]   which won the Beat Gary Kasparov, the world chess
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.580]   champion at the time this was years ago.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:44.940]   Then they turned it into the Jeopardy playing computer,
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.380]   Watson.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.420]   And then they decided to focus on health strategies.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:53.180]   But turned out, I've read many stories now that say,
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:57.460]   Watson isn't any better than any other technology.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:01.020]   It's been struggling for market share.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.700]   And Big Blue is apparently, according to the Wall Street
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:10.540]   Journal, ready to throw in the towel on Watson.
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:11.860]   Oh, God, how do you want some?
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:12.860]   It's out of the job.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.700]   Even Watson.
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.100]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.780]   Watson is also--
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.220]   there's some Watson work that happens
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.100]   on the alley between CNET and the Salesforce Tower.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:24.860]   So this is just like a death knoll for this.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.980]   Oh, my God.
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:30.540]   Watson distracted by the dancers in the tower
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.180]   has decided to pursue a career in the arts.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:40.220]   Yeah, so apparently, even though they've decided--
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.900]   there here's a picture of Watson playing Jeopardy.
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:44.500]   He beat Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.940]   to massive Jeopardy champions.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:51.580]   But honestly, Watson didn't have to press a buzzer button.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:53.620]   And I think that really--
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.300]   Not fair.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:57.300]   Not fair.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.580]   Not fair.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:00.220]   So yeah, I thought they--
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.220]   I heard they were-- yeah, they want to sell it.
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.740]   They want to sell it.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:09.060]   So let's see if I can find a price.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.420]   I bet it's cheaper than Pinterest.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:14.260]   I don't think that there's a price yet considering a sale
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:16.340]   to a private equity firm or industry player
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:18.980]   or a merger with a blank check company.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:19.980]   OK.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.740]   That's from ZDNet.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:22.660]   What's a blank check company?
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:23.660]   I don't know.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.420]   Spack, baby.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:24.940]   Oh, it's a--
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.060]   Oh, it's a spack.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.780]   Probably.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.980]   Spackled it up.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:37.420]   I just learned about Spacks because of 23andMe, which joined
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.180]   with Richard--
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.900]   with Virgin's--
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.700]   Richard Branson.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:47.580]   He had an investment group, the Virgin America--
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:51.500]   or Virgin Investment Group, which has merged with 23andMe
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.700]   as a spack.
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:56.180]   And so now my spit-- actually, they
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:59.580]   have two vials of my spit is owned by Virgin.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.940]   I don't think that's good.
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:03.500]   I don't know.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:08.380]   This is so depressing.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.700]   I don't know if--
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.980]   I went from happy, go lucky stuff to depressing stuff.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:21.620]   Some Texans are going to get electric bills up to $17,000.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:25.500]   This morning, New York Times said that those very, very high ones
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.260]   seem slightly exaggerated, but that it's more common
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:30.340]   that people are getting bills that are still absurd,
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.860]   but more like 2 to 8,000.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:36.540]   This is that famous surge pricing
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.220]   that Uber made famous, right?
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.060]   When it rains in New York City, Uber prices
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:43.460]   go through the roof, right?
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:47.180]   It turns out when the power grid fails in Texas,
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:51.260]   electricity costs as much as 10,000% more.
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.820]   And you had some of the people that actually owned these companies,
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.980]   like making public statements saying, yeah,
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:59.460]   we just hit the jackpot.
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:01.940]   Yes, they literally, that was the phrase.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.820]   Right.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:06.660]   But to be clear with this reporting, as I understand it,
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.620]   this is not all Texans.
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:12.580]   Most majority of people there are on more fixed pricing.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.260]   This is essentially the people that they said, look,
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:21.700]   we will take this bet that the price is going to be generally
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:25.500]   lower and hope that something doesn't happen
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.060]   that really drives prices up.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.100]   The people that took that option are a minority,
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.740]   not trying to excuse it at all.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:34.380]   I still think it's profiteering in the midst
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.140]   of a natural disaster.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:40.940]   I also think it's really important to remember that the media
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:45.660]   has repeatedly said that Texas has a deregulated energy
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.660]   structure.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:50.300]   I think having read Wall Street Journal,
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.220]   New York Times articles about this,
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:57.580]   decriminalized would be a more accurate word than deregulate
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:00.340]   just because some of this extreme behavior,
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.940]   there's literally just no consequence for it.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:07.340]   So I think it's very good advice for anyone out there in Texas
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:11.860]   right now that you might want to turn off autopay as soon as you can.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:14.940]   They're going to offer you something like,
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:20.220]   wait, try to come to a five month pay us back plan with it.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.060]   Don't do that.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:23.860]   Like wait for people to step in and pressure them
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.500]   to come to a reasonable price on this.
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.780]   It's just absolutely unconscionable.
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:31.980]   We already have big chip shortages, partly
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.860]   because of the Bitcoin run on GPUs, partly because Apple
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:42.220]   locked up most of the production of TSMC for the foreseeable future.
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:45.260]   The storm in Texas is also striking chip makers
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.860]   according to the Wall Street Journal, Samsung, NXP,
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.100]   and others are powering down their factories,
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:58.020]   which will enhance the already extreme chip shortage.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:02.660]   The Austin facility is 28% of Samsung's overall production capacity.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:06.380]   Who knew that Samsung was making 28% of their chips in Austin?
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:07.180]   I did not know that.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.620]   That's surprising.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:12.940]   Yeah, there's another story we were looking at doing about Nousvidea
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.020]   and them basically sabotaging one of their lower tier graphics.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.180]   I actually thought this was a good idea.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:21.540]   So yeah, we got Paris back.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.300]   We lost you, I guess, but welcome back.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.780]   We're back on Bitcoin Paris.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:26.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:29.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.740]   So Nousvidea has announced a new video.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.660]   Oh, and there she goes again.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:35.380]   Oh my god.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:38.620]   She's having bandwidth issues in Brooklyn.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:40.140]   She's teleporting.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.420]   Power, power's going out, yikes.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:47.740]   Boy, we shouldn't have said that about the Texas power people.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:48.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:54.140]   So Nousvidea has a new video card coming out.
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:56.700]   I think is it the 3060?
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:57.500]   I think that's it.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:02.740]   And the problem is right now, you can't get a GPU for love or money
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.420]   because they're being snapped up.
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:06.660]   I don't think it's just coin miners.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:07.780]   In fact, I doubt it is.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:10.140]   I'm sure it has a lot more to do to--
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.220]   a lot more because of scalpers and speculation.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.500]   I don't know if I agree with that, Leo.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:20.100]   Friend of Twit, Christina Warren and I
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.020]   are both building supercomputers because we have--
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.580]   we have quarantine craze right now.
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.060]   We both lost our minds.
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.820]   Super gaming computers.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.540]   Well, for me, I want to be ready for Unreal 5.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:33.780]   When it comes out with the Apple lawsuit,
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:36.740]   I'm just-- even though I'm literally recording this
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.100]   on a $6,000 iMac Pro, I've just come to the conclusion
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.500]   there's no feature in Unreal development on--
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.340]   Oh, you were--
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:50.380]   the last couple of times ago, you were on raving about this.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.220]   Unreal Engine 5 looks great.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:56.020]   But I'm getting ready, basically, to learn Unreal.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:58.540]   And I wanted to develop a really good PC for it.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.940]   So thread ripper, AMD chip--
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.580]   Nice.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.740]   --and it's definitely beaten Intel when it comes to that.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:08.460]   Thread ripper is just absolutely amazing.
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:12.700]   But the hardest part to source has been the graphics card.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.700]   And this RTX, the one I ended up getting,
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:22.140]   Leo, it is literally a $1,600 graphics card.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:25.340]   Yeah, I want to tell you why I believe this really is mostly
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:29.220]   Bitcoin people snatching this up.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:33.860]   I did the math on how much money I would make with this
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:37.140]   if I dedicated this ultra-computer that I'm building,
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:41.380]   which is going to cost about $7,000 to Bitcoin mining all day
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:41.900]   long.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.140]   I ran the math on my electricity costs in the area.
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.100]   And it comes down to roughly about $18 a day, which
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.620]   would pay for this entire computer in a year
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:53.980]   if I chose to do that.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.380]   So you're going to make more Bitcoin mining
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:00.780]   that will cost you an electricity.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:01.620]   For the year, yeah.
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:04.220]   And enough so that it will actually
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.100]   pay for this fancy computer.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.420]   If I chose to do that, I'm not sure if I would do it long term,
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.060]   because, again, it's an environmental crime.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.980]   I don't know if I want to contribute to that.
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:16.900]   I'm probably going to try it some just
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.940]   to be able to talk about it on rocket.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.900]   But is this particular--
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:24.500]   Is it a little bit of a roulette game?
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.140]   I mean, do you know consistently how much Bitcoin
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.700]   your mine or is it kind of up and down?
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:34.180]   And like, you might hit 50 Bitcoin tomorrow by accident.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.900]   Well, as I understand the pricing,
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.740]   and part of why I wanted to do this project was to do it
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.660]   and learn all these things for myself,
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:44.180]   but as I understand it, they give you a block of it
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:47.660]   and it's the amount of block you can basically get through
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:49.460]   and you get paid for that.
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:49.980]   OK.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.340]   So it's pretty consistent, predictable return.
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:54.620]   If you're working with a company, as I understand,
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.420]   they get to keep the Bitcoin or the Ethereum.
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.660]   You're just doing your part and helping get it.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:06.660]   But the NVIDIA 3090 that I got is excellent for this.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:10.020]   The 3080 that Christina got is also excellent for this.
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:14.020]   So I fully believe the profit motive is there,
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:16.100]   because you can make more money with this
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.540]   than you'd lose not having it.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.100]   I was assuming that the--
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.260]   because this is part of the way Bitcoin is designed,
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:22.980]   that it gets more and more difficult to mine,
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:25.420]   these math problems harder and harder,
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:28.860]   that's intentional up to when they generate 21 million Bitcoin
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.900]   and then all mining these ceases.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.100]   I was under the impression that by now, it was so hard
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.660]   that you really only could do it in places
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:36.820]   where electricity was almost free.
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:39.660]   But I guess Massachusetts--
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.180]   I know that--
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.260]   Yeah, it's my theory.
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:45.820]   One of my kids got his graphics card when he built his PC.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:49.780]   This is a couple years ago from Bitcoin miners just selling them
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.460]   off like crazy, probably because it was getting harder.
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:55.220]   Right.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:59.260]   So what-- and actually, it doesn't affect Bitcoin, I think.
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:02.500]   But what NVIDIA has decided to do with the 3060
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:06.700]   is to nerf the performance on Ethereum mining.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:09.820]   Apparently, it's not Bitcoin mining,
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:12.100]   it's just Ethereum mining.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:16.620]   And the idea being, well, no one will buy this
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.020]   and will be able to sell it to gamers who are demanding it.
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:20.220]   This is the RTX 3060.
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:24.860]   It's only $329, so it's not as fancy as the one you've got.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.900]   And so the idea is we'll preserve--
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.220]   this will be a good test to see if it's scalpers
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:31.580]   or if it's actually Bitcoin miners who are snapping up
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:34.620]   all the stock because it won't be that useful.
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.940]   Now, for some reason, they're focusing on Ethereum.
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.420]   Maybe they've decided that Bitcoin isn't
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.340]   that popular right now because of its great cost.
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:44.540]   Ethereum is more popular.
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:45.340]   I don't know.
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:45.980]   Right.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.620]   But this is what-- I don't think this makes sense.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:53.700]   I think all of us want companies like Newegg
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.180]   to come to a more equitable way to distribute
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.580]   these graphics cards.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.260]   A cyberpunk coming out, there are a ton of people
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:03.020]   that just want to be able to play this game because it's
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.900]   fundamentally broken on consoles.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:08.180]   So the 3080 has ray tracing.
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:10.460]   There are a lot of really excellent reasons.
[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:14.140]   Gamers would want to spend $600 on this graphics card.
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:17.900]   Where I think the logic is faulty is anyone that
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.260]   has a really large mining operation
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:25.860]   to be buying these cards at bulk to really be contributing
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:30.460]   to this problem is going to be able to rewrite this--
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:33.500]   basically rewrite the driver to get around this.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.420]   And it would be very straightforward.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:38.420]   NVIDIA says it is not an easy thing to do.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.060]   There's a secure handshake between the driver and the silicon.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:45.860]   So it would be very difficult to code a driver that
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:49.900]   would eliminate that hash rate limiter.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.580]   They say-- by the way, here's their answer
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:54.700]   to that question of why not Bitcoin.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:58.140]   Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:00.820]   mineable coin at the moment and is thus
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:04.860]   the likely main driver for GPUs in mining.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.500]   Other algorithms do not contribute significantly
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.020]   to GPU demand.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:09.820]   I didn't know this.
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:11.900]   And this cannot change quickly due to the network effects
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:14.260]   within a given cryptocurrency.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:19.820]   So anything that uses dagger Hashimoto or ETH hash
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.620]   like algorithms will be affected by the rate limiter.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.020]   I don't know.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.940]   Maybe you could mine doge coin.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:27.940]   That's the dream, Liam.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.780]   That's the dream.
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.060]   I'm living the dream.
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:31.100]   That's the American dream.
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.980]   The American dream to mine doge coin.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:35.820]   University of Cambridge did do a study
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:40.820]   on the huge cost of Bitcoin mining.
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:44.420]   And it's pretty bad.
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:49.740]   Bitcoin accounts for 0.48% of the total electricity production
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:54.460]   worldwide, 0.56% of the total electric consumption
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:55.060]   worldwide.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:57.100]   Wow.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.340]   So yeah.
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:02.340]   If it were a country, Bitcoin would
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:04.500]   be in between Argentina and Norway
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:07.620]   in terms of the amount of energy used.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.420]   Nowhere near the US or China, which
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.100]   is at this left-hand side of the graph,
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:14.700]   but still bigger than a lot of countries,
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:19.140]   it's a significant drain on resources.
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.220]   Dang.
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:23.900]   This Microsoft just put up a lot of speaking of resources.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.820]   And it's not Bitcoin mining specific,
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.020]   but Microsoft has started putting data centers
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.740]   for experimenting with putting data centers under water.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:31.340]   Yes.
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:32.180]   Because it's cooler.
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:33.900]   That's so cool.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:35.820]   Yeah, cool.
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:38.100]   I wonder what sort of impact that's
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.540]   going to have on ocean life.
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.940]   Because the heat that produces is immense.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:46.020]   Yeah, but their Google searches will be so much faster.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:46.780]   Oh, that's true.
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:47.340]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:48.300]   And they'll be very wet.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:52.660]   How to avoid shark bite.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:56.620]   Let's take a little break.
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:57.780]   Come back with more.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:59.700]   So your power's been going in and out Paris?
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:00.580]   Is that what's going on?
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:03.180]   No, I think that it was--
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.140]   I guess stop mining Bitcoin during the show.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:08.340]   Yeah, I was mining Bitcoin during the stream,
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.140]   and that was a little bit of an issue.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.900]   It was also just that I have this microphone
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.500]   plugged into my computer and a webcam.
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:19.820]   And I was using a non-small Apple brick to power mine.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:20.940]   Oh, you need the big brick.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.420]   Instead of a big brick.
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.380]   And so it wasn't fully charging.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:26.860]   And I was at 5%, even though I was plugged in.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:28.460]   So I had to go find the big brick.
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:29.220]   We got a job.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:32.020]   We got to add that to our rundown of things
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:33.460]   to do before you come onto it.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.140]   Big brick.
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:34.780]   Get the big brick.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:36.140]   Big brick energy, as they say.
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:42.500]   Did I miss something?
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:42.980]   No.
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:43.580]   Yeah, little.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:44.020]   It was good.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:44.540]   That was good.
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:45.260]   That was good.
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:45.860]   That was good.
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:46.380]   That was good.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.780]   Big brick energy.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:50.860]   Right over my head.
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.620]   And probably it's a good thing.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:53.300]   I'm thinking.
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.700]   Somebody will fill you in later.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:55.340]   OK.
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:58.780]   It's related to the Salesforce Tower.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.500]   That's what I'm afraid of.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.940]   Lindsay Turrentine is here.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.740]   She is a senior, vice president of content and audience,
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:08.100]   at CNET and also a wonderful person.
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.180]   It's always great to have you.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:12.340]   Thank you for taking some time out this Sunday evening.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:15.340]   Same to you, Paris Martino from The Information,
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:16.460]   where she's working on Amazon.
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:17.860]   We'll get to our Amazon stories next.
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:18.580]   How about that, Paris?
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:19.500]   Prepare yourself.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:25.300]   Gird your big brick energy for the next--
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.620]   segment.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:30.580]   And I'm sorry to embarrass you, Brianna.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.580]   We're executive director at the Rebellion Pack.
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.140]   Actually, this is the greatest thing ever.
[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:38.220]   And I used Pill Pack before Amazon acquired them.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.940]   They were an advertiser here.
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:44.580]   And I loved it because it's kind of a real pharmacy.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.700]   But it was automated.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.100]   Amazon bought Pill Pack and integrated that technology
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.340]   into something new.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.860]   They've just launched called Amazon Pharmacy.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:59.180]   If you want to fill your prescriptions as easy as pie,
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:03.060]   without leaving home, you've got to check out Amazon Pharmacy.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:07.020]   It works with your doctor using your prescriptions
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.740]   and your insurance company.
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.740]   Saves you time, delivers medication right to your door.
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.180]   You get the meds you need without leaving home,
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.380]   without taking any chances.
[01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.860]   One less errand, more safety for you.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:21.500]   And it's, I have to say, having used it in the past,
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.180]   it's amazing.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.740]   It saves you time.
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:26.700]   So, Amazon Pharmacy delivers your medication directly to your
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.380]   door, no more waiting in line.
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:30.460]   And the pharmacy, no one wants to do that.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:32.300]   People cough and then hack and everything.
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:35.340]   It's easy because you just have your doctors
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.300]   send the prescription straight to Amazon Pharmacy.
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:38.900]   They coordinate with your doctor.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:40.020]   They ensure everything's accurate.
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:42.340]   They actually have some very interesting technologies
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:45.780]   to make sure you get exactly the right prescription,
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.020]   the right size pill, everything.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:48.340]   You're getting what you need.
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.980]   Yes, you can use your insurance Amazon pharmacy
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:54.140]   works with almost every insurance plan nationwide.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:57.220]   And if you don't have insurance, great,
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:00.300]   because Amazon Prime members get free two-day delivery
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.980]   and savings on prescription medication
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:04.980]   if you're paying without insurance.
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.780]   So, everybody, if you're a Prime member,
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:09.340]   you get the two-day and you'll also get discounts
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:10.380]   if you're not using insurance.
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.980]   Surpricing, very easy to understand, very clear.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.140]   In fact, most of the time, I don't know about your experience
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.100]   when you go to the pharmacy to get medication.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:20.060]   You don't know what the cost is until you get to the
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:23.340]   JEX-10 and then they go, "That's $374, please."
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.260]   Amazon pharmacy tells you right up front
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:28.820]   what your insurance copay is, the price without insurance.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.340]   You know exactly what you're paying before
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:33.260]   you make the transaction.
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:37.420]   And of course, it's absolutely private, absolutely secure.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:40.340]   They never share any personal health data
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.660]   outside the pharmacy.
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:43.940]   That's their promise to you.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.900]   And yes, there is a pharmacist on staff 24/7.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:50.740]   So you can always ask for advice or ask questions.
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:52.180]   You can always speak with a pharmacist
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:53.580]   anytime of the day or night.
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:58.100]   Amazon pharmacy, if you're an Amazon Prime member,
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.700]   you'll save on prescription medication
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.020]   when not using insurance and you get free two-day delivery.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:07.100]   And I have to say, the technology behind this is really amazing.
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.500]   It's fast, it's easy, it's always accurate.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:14.500]   Amazon.com/twitRx, that's the URL.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.620]   Just use that so they know you saw it here.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.900]   You know, that's all I ask.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:23.900]   Amazon.com/twitRx, Amazon pharmacy, brand new.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:26.780]   Try it out immediately, of course.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:29.780]   And it's really amazing, Amazon.com/twitRx.
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:35.980]   Thank you, Amazon, for supporting the show.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:37.620]   And thank you for supporting the show
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.540]   by using that special address.
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:41.780]   So first of all, I guess I wanna ask you,
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:44.620]   Paris Martenot, about Jeff Bezos,
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.900]   stepping back and giving the CEO job
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:51.660]   to a guy named Greg Jassy, who is the AWS--
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.500]   Andy Jassy.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:56.340]   Andy Jassy, I'm sorry, who is AWS, runs AWS right now.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:01.500]   From your time covering Amazon, good move?
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:04.620]   I mean, I think it's certainly an interesting move,
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:06.820]   a surprising move.
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.460]   Makes sense in a lot of ways though.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:13.420]   Jeff prior to the pandemic had,
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.580]   I mean, as most CEOs of a company,
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:17.900]   the size of Amazon been a little checked out
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.660]   from day to day operations and focused more
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:25.660]   on the variety of moonshots or kind of new initiatives
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.420]   the company was focused on.
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.780]   Or, I guess in a specific case,
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:34.420]   the moonshots that he has personally invested in.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:36.300]   He's also got his own kind of investments
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:38.060]   in the Washington Post and things like that
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.180]   that have been taking his time away
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.180]   from the core of the company.
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:47.180]   And Jassy has been with Amazon for more than two decades now.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:52.900]   Almost, you know, he is a very well positioned to take over
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:57.340]   and be able to kind of manage the day to day things
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:01.460]   that Bezos doesn't have that much interest in.
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:02.300]   That being said--
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:04.020]   And may not have been doing much with labor.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:05.500]   And may not have been doing much.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:10.140]   And I guess that being said, one point that Amazon execs
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:11.780]   were hammering over and over
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:14.380]   because this announcement of the transition
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:17.660]   happened at the exact same time as fourth quarter earnings,
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.340]   which it meant that the entire fourth quarter earnings
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:24.940]   calls afterwards because once a company released this,
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.580]   they generally have a press call
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:28.580]   as well as the calls with investors.
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:31.260]   All of the talk was kind of dominated by this news.
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:35.940]   But during those calls, Amazon executives kept mentioning
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:38.940]   over and over again, okay, yes, Jeff is stepping back,
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.980]   but he's still gonna be involved in key product decisions.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:46.980]   If there's a big decision or choice or acquisition topic,
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:51.940]   Jeff, who is going to be on executive chairman of the board
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.100]   now, he'll still be involved with those.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.020]   So it's not a complete transition,
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.540]   even though it kind of is.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:02.260]   - There are some who say, well, the timing was exactly right
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:05.500]   'cause it had the best quarter ever, huge profits.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:06.340]   So good time to go out.
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.180]   - Insane profits.
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:10.100]   - Insane profits, good time to go out on a high.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.380]   And others have pointed out also a good time to get out
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:15.580]   because the world is closing in.
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:18.660]   You've got Congress investigating.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:21.180]   There's a lot of anti big tech sentiment.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.980]   Amazon's gonna start having union issues.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.340]   In fact, there was a article in the New York Times Magazine
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:29.940]   that today, Amazon's great labor awakening.
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:33.420]   COVID-19 has cemented the e-commerce giants hold
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.500]   on the economy, but it has also spurred employees
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:39.420]   all around the country to organize.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:44.420]   Amazon, like Google, has been fighting unionization.
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:48.300]   - On February 8th, mail-in ballots went out
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:52.900]   to all the employees of Amazon's warehouse in Besmer, Alabama
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:55.860]   so that they can send in their votes
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:58.340]   as to whether or not they want to participate in a union.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:02.100]   Amazon had been very vehemently opposed to this
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:05.820]   and tried to make it so that the employees
[01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:08.740]   couldn't vote from home and instead would have to come
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.140]   into the warehouse and mass to cast their votes
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:14.180]   despite all of the COVID concerns, but they were overruled.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:20.420]   - The article talks about Amazon in what's called
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:23.060]   the Inland Empire in Southern California,
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:26.260]   San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:30.660]   Amazon is the largest employer in the region, 14 facilities,
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:34.620]   14 two logistics air hubs,
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:38.020]   40,000 people work for Amazon in this area
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.100]   of Southern California.
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:42.060]   And so, one of the things people say is,
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.900]   well, if you don't like working at Amazon,
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:46.820]   at least they're hiring, at least people are getting jobs,
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.380]   nobody's making you work there, but if you live
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:51.780]   in this area, it may be that's the job,
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.380]   that's the one job you can get.
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:56.620]   - And the thing that I think people are overlooking is
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:59.020]   more and more that is going to be the case
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:01.740]   across the US specifically over the last year
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:04.540]   during COVID, Amazon had this unprecedented
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.540]   physical expansion in the US.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:11.020]   Now, I mean, it more than doubled the number
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:13.180]   of delivery stations that it has in the US,
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.420]   which are these kind of warehouse facilities
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.060]   that unlike the fulfillment centers we think of,
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:20.460]   they operate kind of like Amazon Post offices
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:24.060]   where packages from Amazon warehouses will go
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.560]   and then be organized so that they can be delivered.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:30.900]   But Amazon has been, like, I believe that they grew
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:33.060]   their physical presence in the US over 2020
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:34.620]   by more than 50%.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:37.860]   - Between January and October of 2020,
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:42.700]   they added 427,300 employees worldwide,
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.620]   almost half a million new workers.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:48.500]   A thousand new facilities in suburbs
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:51.340]   across the United States, a thousand.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.700]   - And those facilities are specifically about
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:56.460]   localizing delivery and allowing, I mean,
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.460]   those facilities may not have that many direct jobs
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.580]   working in the facility, but they operate as hubs
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:06.660]   for Amazon Flex, which is their kind of a contract-based,
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.660]   almost Uber-esque delivery program
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.900]   where people can agree to sign up for blocks
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.820]   to go pick up packages and then drop them off
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:16.060]   at people's homes in the 40-minute radius
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:18.740]   around the facility, which means there are less
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.020]   of those packages being delivered by postal workers or UPS
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.940]   and more kind of going through this weird half-pazzered
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.420]   Amazon ecosystem.
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.700]   It doesn't surprise me that California
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:34.060]   seeing such growth because we passed Prop 22 in June,
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:38.260]   which was the proposition floated by Uber and Lyft
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.380]   to allow them to continue to hire,
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:43.260]   not to hire workers to make them contractors.
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:48.260]   And it feels like it, in California,
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:52.740]   you've got an opportunity to do more of this gig working
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:56.820]   stuff, this flex-style stuff, because it's now protected.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:59.620]   And you don't have to pay people for health insurance.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:02.300]   You don't have to pay people a decent living wage.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:07.820]   - I just think about the people I met running for office
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:10.300]   here in Massachusetts that worked at Amazon
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:13.140]   and them telling me about the working conditions
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:17.780]   where they felt tremendous pressure to come in at 10
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:21.740]   and then work until the early hours of the morning.
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:25.660]   I remember hearing about older people talking to me
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.380]   about how they lost their job and they're trying physically
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:32.500]   to push through, walk around warehouse all day
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:36.100]   putting things in boxes and how it takes a brutal toll
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:37.020]   on their body.
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:40.020]   And you read in this New York Times story
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:42.740]   about how this lawsuit being brought forward
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:46.060]   is because they wouldn't keep people safe from COVID-19
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:49.180]   and kind of pushed past the kind of protections
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:51.300]   that they needed to take allegedly.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:55.380]   So I just think Amazon can put out all this
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:57.180]   like as videos in the world there.
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.100]   But I think ultimately they've got to be answerable
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:02.860]   to regulators in providing a safe workplace.
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:05.900]   That just seems like the bare minimum there.
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.820]   - Is unionization a solution?
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.660]   - In particular.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:10.100]   - Go ahead, Paris, sorry.
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:11.660]   - Oh, as I'd say, and this week in particular,
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:16.660]   I think shows kind of the complexity of that push
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:19.980]   and pull between Amazon regulators
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.220]   as the New York State Attorney General
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:25.860]   just sued Amazon for what they allege
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:30.860]   as not properly protecting their employees from COVID-19.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:35.100]   And that only came after Amazon a couple of days earlier
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.860]   preemptively sued the New York State Attorney General
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.340]   saying the New York State Attorney General
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:44.180]   shouldn't have the authority to try and regulate
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:48.100]   our protection of workers in New York facilities.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.300]   That should only be the job of the federal government.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:52.780]   You should keep your hands off of us.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.940]   - So it's, I mean, growing and growing.
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:56.860]   And this is far from the only case
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:58.340]   that Amazon is currently involved,
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:01.060]   that a State Attorney General level right now.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.100]   - Yeah.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:05.020]   Yeah, Leo, to answer your question about unionization,
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:07.380]   I am clear-eyed and realistic.
[01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:09.700]   I think sometimes people talk about unions
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:11.620]   like they're a panacea.
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.900]   And here in Boston, we're a union town.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:18.340]   Like everything in Boston is based around the power of unions.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.340]   Like at Marty Walsh, that was just brought
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:22.340]   into the Biden administration.
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.860]   He's a union guy and the reason he's mayor of Boston
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:26.340]   is because of those ties.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:30.820]   I, you know, some of the most sexist experiences
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:35.820]   I had running for office were dealing with unions here in Boston.
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:39.460]   Like it was just the most condescending
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:42.380]   like old boys club stuff you could possibly imagine.
[01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:46.180]   And I'm, I'm realistic that that is something
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:47.780]   that happens with this.
[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:51.700]   But I feel like overall, you workers are not gonna,
[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:53.420]   like Amazon is a corporation.
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:56.140]   They're gonna do ways in their best interest,
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:58.020]   which is pay their workers the least.
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:02.020]   And I just think overall moving in that direction,
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:04.140]   is it gonna solve every single problem?
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:05.620]   Of course not.
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:08.380]   Are there gonna be unintended consequences of horse not?
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.500]   Am I gonna pay a little bit more in Amazon Prime every year?
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.740]   Of course not.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:15.260]   But will it give workers the bargaining power
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:18.540]   that they need to make these workplaces more safe?
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.740]   I think that answer is probably yes.
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.020]   So I'm personally very much for that.
[01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:25.540]   - It's a challenge.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.380]   I mean, I, especially during a quarantine,
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:29.860]   I shop at Amazon more.
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:31.100]   That's why they made more money.
[01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:31.940]   I'm not alone.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:32.780]   - Yeah.
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:33.620]   - Yeah.
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:35.540]   - It's of great convenience,
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:37.860]   but you really have to be aware of the toll
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:40.780]   that it's taking on its workers.
[01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:44.900]   - I think if we've learned anything over the last decade,
[01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:49.580]   it's that people will trade almost anything for convenience.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:50.420]   - Yep.
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:51.340]   - I actually think that, I mean,
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.740]   very, very, very big picture that speaks
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:58.500]   to the absolute premium our time is at, as a culture.
[01:59:58.500 --> 01:59:59.340]   - Yeah.
[01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:01.260]   - A country and like in the world overall,
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.740]   like we all are just sort of taxed down
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:06.100]   to the very, very minute of every day.
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:08.460]   And so we're willing to pay to get some of that time back.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:10.100]   And it's a tough.
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:12.900]   - That's my excuse and I'm sticking with it.
[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:13.740]   - It's tough.
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:14.740]   - I'm busy.
[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:15.580]   I don't have time.
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:17.220]   I'm sorry Amazon workers.
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.620]   I think, you know, a lot of us say,
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:20.900]   "Well, if they don't like it, they could quit."
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:24.820]   Here's a quote from the New York Times story.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:27.780]   There, you know, workers get fired very easily
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:28.620]   over small things.
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:31.940]   They're not making rates or taking too much time off task.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:33.740]   There's always this pool of people
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:35.540]   or one step behind you.
[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:38.340]   So if you speak up or if you organize,
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.300]   in other words attempt to unionize,
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:43.460]   there's a hundred temp workers right outside the door
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:44.900]   who would be able to take your job.
[02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:46.700]   And I gather they're not just,
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:49.100]   they're not that many other jobs.
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:49.940]   - Yeah.
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:53.780]   - Especially not that many other jobs that pay
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:55.180]   at the rate of Amazon.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.020]   - It's more than a minimum wage, right?
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:01:00.540]   - It's $15 an hour in a lot of warehouses,
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:02.820]   which is a good rate in comparison
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.820]   to the minimum wage and pay for other work and labor.
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:11.780]   But I don't think that minimizes in any way
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:14.740]   the complaints and toll that these sort of jobs
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.660]   they're taking on these people's bodies and their lives.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:20.540]   - And by the way, I could go shop at Walmart,
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:23.540]   but I don't know if that's gonna be any better.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:27.860]   I think this is maybe a systemic problem.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:31.580]   And as a consumer, I don't know if there's a remedy.
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:34.980]   I guess go down to my local stores.
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:36.180]   I probably should buy books.
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:40.660]   - There are some, I mean, there are some, I guess,
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:42.540]   remedies or alternatives being proposed.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:47.540]   Bookshop is a local, I guess, alternative for Amazon,
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:51.060]   just in the sense that it connects a lot of local booksellers.
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:54.420]   They specifically are getting the payment
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:56.740]   when you buy a book from them and it's shipped to you.
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:58.860]   Similarly in New York,
[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:01.860]   there is a new kind of initiative called
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:04.780]   it's shopin.nyc.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:09.340]   And it is a collection of retailers here in Brooklyn
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:12.420]   and Manhattan that are just storefronts.
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:14.900]   Small shops, but they, all of their products
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:16.900]   have been integrated under this online platform
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:18.700]   and you can go and buy, you know,
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:23.700]   chocolates, pants, random house goods, things like that.
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:26.580]   They're all from different stores,
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:28.860]   but then the stores will put them in a little box,
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:31.340]   put it outside, a courier will come and pick it up.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:34.020]   It'll all be put in one box for you delivered to your door.
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:34.860]   - I'll do that.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.700]   - And then just get the money.
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:37.500]   - That sounds good.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:40.500]   I've been buying audio books 'cause Audible,
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:44.700]   I've been an Audible customer since for 20 years now.
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:46.860]   That's owned by Amazon.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.060]   So I've been looking at libro.fm.
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:50.860]   Corey Doctorow told me about this,
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:53.060]   which is the same audio books,
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.420]   but they share some of the money with your local bookstore.
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:58.500]   And you can see my local Copperfields books
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:02:59.340]   get some of the money.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:01.820]   So I think that's a nice way to do it.
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:04.780]   Maybe we should start looking for those kinds of alternatives.
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:07.660]   - I don't know.
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:10.740]   I always, I feel like I've sat in so many meetings
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:15.340]   where people talk about some future they wanna get to,
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:18.940]   where everyone on the planet is gonna make this different choice
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.660]   and it's all gonna get better.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.540]   Everyone just signed off a Facebook.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:23.900]   It'll solve everything.
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:26.780]   And I really feel strongly that, you know,
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.420]   the answer is regulation.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:29.260]   - Yeah.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:33.260]   - I just, I feel like anything more than that is just wishing
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.100]   it's almost--
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:36.100]   - Yeah, the onus shouldn't be on the consumer.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:37.460]   - Right, exactly.
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:39.300]   - Okay.
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.140]   - And it shouldn't.
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:42.900]   And humans are not famous for making the right decisions
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.700]   just because we think they're the right decisions.
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:45.540]   - Right.
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:47.980]   I'm having so much fun.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:50.420]   What a great panel, Brianna Wu.
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:53.340]   Again, rebellionpack.com.
[02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:54.180]   What are you driving?
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:56.180]   Still, is you driving your Porsche?
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.260]   Your boxer?
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:02.260]   - Leo, I just bought a 1986 Carrera 3.2 Tarka.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:05.700]   I have an air cooled Porsche.
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.900]   I have been working, I need a pandemic project.
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:12.420]   I have been working nonstop, I'm fixing it up
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:15.820]   and it is beautiful and exquisite to drive.
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:17.260]   - Is it a ragtop?
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:21.580]   - It is a ragtop and it is, is Garge Red and it is--
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:22.940]   - Oh man.
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:25.100]   - Oh, I tell you it is so much fun.
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.300]   - See, 'cause I'm not on Facebook or Instagram or that.
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:29.460]   So if I don't know how anybody's doing anymore,
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:31.660]   you've probably posted pictures about this.
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:32.500]   I just haven't seen them.
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:35.100]   - I try to, you know, it's, it's a Porsche.
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.340]   So I try not to talk about it.
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.260]   - I know, I know, I feel guilty.
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:39.100]   - It's a lot of it.
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:40.020]   - Honestly, I just bought a new car.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.140]   I feel very guilty.
[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:44.780]   I don't wanna, I feel so bad about people for people.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.500]   It's such a tough time for so many people right now.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:52.500]   I don't wanna celebrate my, any of my victories.
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:54.300]   - They had the same time.
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:57.180]   It's like, you know, there's something about it.
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:01.820]   Like modern cars are, you know, it's like an 80 synthesizer.
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:06.820]   Like you can program a computer to play a chord perfectly well
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:10.340]   and it will do it faster and better and more accurately.
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:13.220]   But it's a difference in you sitting down in a piano
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:15.260]   and learning to play the scales yourself
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:17.220]   and putting the emotion into it.
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:22.220]   That is what driving a 34 year old Porsche 911 feels like.
[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:24.540]   You're working the gears yourself.
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:26.420]   There's no power steering.
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:28.620]   You feel every bump in the road.
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:30.780]   You have to check the oil yourself
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:32.500]   because the gauges are pointless.
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:37.300]   It is the opposite of everything in the technology industry
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:39.020]   and I just, I love it.
[02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:41.380]   It makes me feel so alive, driving it.
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:46.180]   - So you're basically saying that by driving a modern car,
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:49.500]   I'm driving like Kraftwerk, the equivalent of it.
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.460]   (laughing)
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.580]   - Your car is beautiful, I would not say I'm bad about it.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.100]   - I do like my new car.
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:55.940]   - Yeah.
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:56.780]   - It's all electric.
[02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:58.780]   So I'm pretending it's good for the environment.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:05:59.620]   That's my...
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:00.820]   There are kits out there.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:05.900]   I'm really close to, they're only $15,000 for you to pull
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:10.460]   the engine out of this thing and turn it into an electric car.
[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:12.820]   And I'm about this close to doing that
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:15.980]   'cause it'll put all the weight down so it's more stable.
[02:06:15.980 --> 02:06:19.820]   And I just, I think it will be a blast actually do that.
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:22.660]   - Yeah, it's fun to drive too 'cause they have so much.
[02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:24.540]   - That would be really interesting to see plugged in
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.580]   at the electric charging station.
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:27.420]   - Right, right.
[02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:28.420]   - So it's my fault of course.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.420]   (laughing)
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:33.260]   Neil Young famously took a Lincoln with suicide doors
[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:35.140]   and turned it, electrified it.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:36.460]   I'd love that.
[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:37.540]   (laughing)
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:40.300]   An electric boat basically for the highway.
[02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:45.820]   And Paris Martynau also with us from the information.
[02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:46.660]   It's great to have you.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:49.060]   - I'm driving my electric bike around the area.
[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:50.540]   - Oh, aren't those great?
[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:51.460]   Don't you love those?
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:53.020]   - They're the best.
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:55.940]   Best decision I have made in a long time.
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:58.460]   I have the Freedom X from Wing Bikes,
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:01.180]   which is a retailer based here in New York
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:04.220]   and it is the absolute best decision I have made.
[02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:06.380]   It's wonderful. - Nice.
[02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:10.460]   Electric bikes are great because you still pedal.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:12.420]   You still feel like you're riding a bike.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.260]   But whenever you need it.
[02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:15.940]   - I can turn off the pedal assist if I want,
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:17.780]   which I do some my regular.
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.940]   But if I need to get to the dentist office at 8 a.m.,
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:21.940]   I don't wanna be a sweatshirt.
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:23.460]   - It's awesome. - So I'll turn it off.
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:24.700]   - Yeah, love it.
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:26.660]   It's best about the worlds.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:29.860]   And Lindsey Turntine, who is basically living
[02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:31.980]   in the eight is enough house.
[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:33.140]   - That's true.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.660]   (laughing)
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:36.540]   In this case, it's six.
[02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:37.980]   - Six is almost enough.
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:38.820]   - And almost enough.
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:39.660]   - I'll put two cats.
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:40.660]   - Let's eight. - I guess that's eight.
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.220]   - There it is. - The bait.
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:44.700]   But they've been wonderful during this event.
[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:45.540]   They've been quiet.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:47.100]   I see you put the CNET logo up on the wall,
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:47.940]   which is awesome.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:50.580]   I love this. - This is our CES set.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:52.700]   So I'm on set.
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:54.180]   - Perfect.
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:59.180]   - She's on set, SVP content and audience at CNET.
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:00.580]   Fantastic panel.
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.660]   So glad you're here.
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:08.540]   I wanted to play a little bit of a video here.
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:13.140]   So Metallica, I guess every year at the Blizzard Conference.
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:17.300]   And you know what?
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:19.740]   I had the link and I don't have it with me.
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:23.780]   Chatroom, do you have that YouTube link of the actual,
[02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:25.420]   I guess I can't play it.
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:28.220]   So anyway, Metallica is doing a conference for BlizzCon,
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:30.700]   but it's gotta be streamed, right?
[02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.740]   And they streamed it among other places.
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:33.500]   They streamed it on YouTube,
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:36.060]   but they also streamed it on Twitch.
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:41.060]   Except that on Twitch, if you play copyright music,
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.820]   they don't like that 'cause there's no license.
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:45.300]   - Even if you are Metallica.
[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:47.300]   - Even if you are Metallica.
[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:49.980]   They're playing for whom the bell tolls.
[02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:53.740]   This is how it sounded on Twitch.
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:56.160]   (soft music)
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:02.900]   It's a little bit smaller bell than I remember,
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:05.660]   but they are rocking out to it, aren't they?
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:06.980]   Look at that.
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:09.400]   Kirk Hammad just jamming that solo.
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:12.020]   - Oh man.
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:15.060]   - They're getting a taste of their own medicine.
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:17.620]   - Yes, because right, you remember Lars Oric
[02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:19.860]   was the guy who put Napster out of business.
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:22.420]   Climbing all their music was stolen on Napster.
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:26.180]   I guess if you were watching on YouTube,
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.020]   they allowed the music to go through.
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.780]   But you know, it's, these are automatically
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:32.140]   these copyright protection tools.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:34.740]   And I guess the good news is Metallica
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:36.860]   sounded just like they did on the record.
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:39.500]   (laughing)
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:42.780]   - Leo, I have to say like the music right situation
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:45.940]   on Twitch is just, it's an absolute mess.
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:48.540]   I mean, when you, it's gotten to the point
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:53.540]   where games are literally putting options in the menu,
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:56.500]   saying turn off all license songs.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:59.460]   Like if you're streaming this on Twitch,
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.900]   so you don't get copyright strikes,
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:04.540]   that's a fundamentally broken situation.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.100]   And I think, you know, earlier we had a discussion
[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:09.580]   about wanting journalists to get paid.
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:13.500]   Obviously we want musicians to be paid for their music,
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:16.500]   to be fairly compensated, but it's just,
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:20.100]   it's an absolutely untenable situation on Twitch.
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:24.500]   - There's a good model for this, which is TikTok.
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:25.340]   - Yeah.
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:27.900]   - TikTok pays a lot of money, I believe.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.300]   I know they just did a big payment to UMG,
[02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:32.140]   the Universal Music Group.
[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:37.140]   They pay a lot of money to allow you to use music.
[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:39.580]   And you know what, I think the record company's like it too.
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:42.460]   Look at the Fleetwood Mac Dreams,
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:44.940]   which 20 years after its release is number one,
[02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:47.020]   it was number one on the charts again,
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:49.820]   'cause some guy on a skateboard with some cranberry juice
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:53.620]   used it and everybody said picked up on it
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:56.140]   and it went right up back up the charts.
[02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:59.340]   So it's good for music sales, they pay license fees.
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.820]   That's a good model, the TikTok model.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.660]   - Yeah.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:04.220]   - Maybe they don't like it on Twitch
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:08.180]   because it goes on in the background,
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:10.340]   but there's still somebody talking over it, right?
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:11.380]   It's not like you could say,
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:14.220]   well, I don't have to buy that song, I got it from Twitch.
[02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:15.420]   - Yeah.
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:18.300]   I mean, it seems very incidental to the use for me.
[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:22.100]   I mean, you know, they're licensing in the game itself,
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:24.460]   you're broadcasting a copy of the game,
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:26.380]   you're playing it, it's ridiculous.
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:27.700]   - It's good for the record.
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:29.380]   Also, you don't have that,
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:32.380]   in the music industry these days does not have that many places.
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:35.020]   In my day, you've got it on the radio,
[02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.580]   man, you could sell some records.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:38.900]   I don't think that's the case anymore.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:41.100]   They don't have as many places they can promote a record.
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:43.380]   I think they should take advantage of that.
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:45.580]   - I also think it's worth like really thinking
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:48.020]   about who the people are, they're streaming on Twitch.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:49.860]   Yeah, I do it for my speedruns.
[02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:52.100]   I have a very, very tiny channel.
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:54.940]   It's more like to just prove that I did it.
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:57.780]   But I mean, this is like one of the few areas
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:01.580]   where a lot of millennials and Gen Y have,
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.660]   some of them are getting extra cash from this
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:06.980]   and a very lucky few have managed to make a living from it.
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:09.740]   Like that's the people you're going after.
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:11.700]   Like it's just ridiculous.
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:13.460]   These are not giant corporations.
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:18.140]   So I just think Twitch is fundamentally broken here.
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:21.340]   - Let me see, am I going to get in trouble
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:23.940]   if I play this video?
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:27.180]   Oh, this is somebody else's video of it.
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:30.740]   I want to find the actual performance of them playing
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:31.700]   for whom the bell tolls,
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:34.740]   'cause it just breaks in right in the middle.
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:36.340]   Let me see if I can find it.
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:39.140]   Here's the five minute performance.
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:43.260]   I see this isn't going to have it.
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:45.580]   And besides, it just gets taken down,
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:49.980]   even though, and correct me if I'm wrong, Lindsey Turnstein,
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:51.780]   I believe that would be fair use.
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:53.620]   We're covering a new story, right?
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:55.020]   - Yes, it would be fair use.
[02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:56.460]   You're talking, I mean, I'm not a lawyer,
[02:12:56.460 --> 02:13:00.260]   but you're talking about this story.
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:01.740]   Which is about that.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.420]   - Go explain to them.
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:04.940]   - Computers don't understand that.
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:06.980]   - They don't get fair use now.
[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:08.140]   They don't get it.
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:11.380]   - Ladies and gentlemen, fun show.
[02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:13.940]   I really appreciate your time.
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:15.740]   It's probably the sun has already gone down
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:17.740]   in San Francisco, so it's probably too late, Lindsey,
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:19.580]   for you to go out and enjoy this wonderful,
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:21.180]   balmy air evening.
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.100]   - I'm going to go out.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:22.940]   - Dude, get out of here.
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:24.220]   - I see sun out there.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:25.420]   - Go out out.
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:26.380]   Get on out of here,
[02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:29.300]   Lindsey Turnstein, SVP content and audience,
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:32.460]   seeing it, one of the smartest people in the business,
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:33.300]   always a pleasure.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:36.900]   Thank you so much for bringing your knowledge to our show.
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:38.980]   This week and every week, not every week,
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:40.380]   but every time you're on, you're wonderful.
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:41.580]   Thank you.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:42.940]   Every week that you're on.
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:44.460]   Yes, thank you.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:46.460]   Thank you, Paris Martyno.
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:48.500]   I'm so glad you landed the information.
[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:51.660]   You make my $400 a year subscription fee worth it.
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.700]   - Glad to hear that.
[02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:54.620]   - Yes.
[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:57.340]   Yes, tell Jessica I will keep subscribing
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:00.460]   as long as they have Paris Martyno on the staff.
[02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:01.740]   - I'll let her know.
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:03.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:05.500]   She actually just did a good piece.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:10.500]   She's been writing more about the kind of at the thought piece
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:12.820]   level, which is great.
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:15.220]   - Yeah, she has a good column on Saturday.
[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:16.220]   - Yeah, she just did.
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:17.300]   - Talked about media.
[02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:18.820]   - Oh, okay, the takeaway.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:20.820]   Yeah, so she has a good piece,
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:22.380]   if you haven't read it on the big lesson
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.820]   from Google and Facebook's Australian News Crisis.
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.180]   Good think piece.
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:29.900]   Thank you, so thank you, Paris,
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:31.100]   really appreciate it.
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:33.180]   Go out and enjoy your electric bike
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:34.380]   on the streets of Brooklyn.
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:36.100]   - Oh, I will.
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:39.780]   - Watch out for the renegade Uber drivers.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.820]   And thank you so much.
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:44.660]   Actually, watch out for the Porsche Carrera,
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:49.580]   Targa, driven all the way from Massachusetts by Branna Wu.
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:51.340]   Rebellion Pack, let me go there,
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:54.300]   anything we should tell people about Rebellion Pack?
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:56.900]   - You know, if you believe in the work that we do,
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:59.740]   which is helping get the right Democrats elected,
[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:04.020]   you can do supporters by going helptherebellion.com.
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:07.780]   We're doing a really big push on this civil rights bill,
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:09.300]   which we're very excited about.
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:12.860]   And yeah, basically it's not enough to believe in something
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:14.100]   or tweet about something.
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:17.420]   You have to support causes that you believe in.
[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:18.820]   So there it is.
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:21.060]   - And the money you use for what lobbying
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:22.940]   for TV commercials, what do you do?
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:24.060]   - That's a really good question.
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:26.060]   Leah, we're very seriously looking
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:29.380]   at actually hiring our very own lobbyist
[02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:32.940]   for Rebellion Pack who would directly go to Congress
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:34.740]   and propose bills.
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:38.460]   And one of the things I would do if we did that
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:40.940]   was start forming alliances with tech groups
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:43.660]   to put forward tech policy that I believe in.
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:46.180]   So if you've got a lobbyist on staff,
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:47.700]   the way that you get bills passed
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:49.420]   is working with other people.
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:51.700]   So there's a lot of work that we would get done
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:52.860]   on tech issues.
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:56.220]   - I would love it also if you would provide informational
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:16:00.500]   stuff as nonpartisan as you can to members of Congress
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:03.060]   who are unfortunately often woefully under educated
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:03.900]   on tech issues.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:05.580]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:08.340]   - I just, we watched, Lisa and I watched
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:10.740]   Steven Spielberg's Lincoln last night.
[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:14.900]   And it was so fun to watch and know that Congress
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:18.740]   has been just a screwed up for 150 years.
[02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:22.060]   It's not changed all that much.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:24.140]   The debates are still the same.
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:25.820]   They just don't beat each other with sticks
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:27.980]   as much as they used to.
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:29.260]   - Well, there's a sense.
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.580]   - There's other people to do it.
[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:31.420]   - Yeah.
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:33.580]   - Brianna Wu, Executive Director of Rebellion Pack.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.700]   Thank you all three of you for being here.
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.420]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon,
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:39.020]   right after my radio show.
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:41.900]   It's about 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern,
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:43.220]   2230 UTC.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.180]   You could pick it up on our live stream.
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:47.300]   You don't have to, but if you like to watch live,
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:48.940]   I like live for some reason.
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:50.700]   I guess that's why we offer the live stream
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:53.180]   'cause it's just real unedited and fun.
[02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:54.580]   And you know people are doing it exactly
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:55.420]   as you're watching it.
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:57.380]   That live stream audio and video is available
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:17:00.500]   at twit.tv/live.
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:03.460]   You can pick which stream you want.
[02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:05.140]   You're gonna be funny if Twitch replaced
[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:06.820]   this entire show with bells.
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:07.820]   That would be great.
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:11.980]   Be my guest 'cause we still have YouTube
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:14.100]   and you stream in all the other sources.
[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.740]   If you're watching live chat live,
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.660]   that's the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:20.260]   There's a web interface.
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:22.180]   Best way to do it if you're gonna be in there more than once
[02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:23.540]   is to get an IRC client.
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:27.100]   It's the old school predates even the worldwide web.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:28.580]   It's the way things used to be kids.
[02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:31.220]   All text all the time.
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:33.060]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:34.980]   On demand versions of everything we do available
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:36.860]   at our website, twit.tv.
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:42.460]   And honestly, there's audio and video there,
[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:45.020]   but you can also watch YouTube.
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:47.700]   There's a YouTube channel for this week in tech.
[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:49.420]   Probably my favorite way for you to watch
[02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:51.540]   is to subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.500]   That way you get it every week.
[02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:54.340]   You don't have to think about it.
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:55.500]   It's just there on your device
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:57.700]   and you can listen to it on your way home
[02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.340]   or wherever you're going.
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:02.900]   On your way to Popeyes Chicken,
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:04.340]   which is I think where I'm going.
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:06.600]   (laughing)
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.300]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:10.700]   We'll see you next time.
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:11.980]   I didn't mean to say that out loud.
[02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:12.820]   Another twit.
[02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:13.660]   (laughing)
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:16.240]   (upbeat music)
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.340]   ♪ Do it the twit ♪
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:18.180]   ♪ Do it the twit ♪

[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:28.580]   You can take it KFC and make it the KFC PC
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:29.580]   that they're putting out.
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:32.020]   They're making a KFC PC.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:35.580]   Oh, what's the name of the KFC computer?
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:36.420]   I forget the name of it.
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:39.300]   Oh, it's from Cooler Master, the KFC console.
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:41.100]   KFC console, yeah.
[02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:42.540]   Power your hunger.
[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:43.940]   It's a key for your chicken.
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:44.940]   How did I miss this?
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:48.220]   From the fires of the KFC ovens built by Cooler Master,
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:50.740]   from the ground up, there's never been a taste to your way.
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:52.580]   Can you put chicken in it?
[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:53.420]   Yeah, you can't.
[02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:55.020]   It's a decent PC too.
[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:56.020]   Wait, what?
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:57.020]   What?
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:58.020]   What?
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:18:59.660]   It has a chicken chamber.
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:00.660]   What?
[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:02.660]   I simply hate it.
[02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:03.660]   Wait a minute.
[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:05.220]   Doesn't that drip greasy?
[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:10.380]   You're utilizing the system's natural heat and air flow system.
[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:16.340]   You can now focus on your flame plate and enjoy hot crispy chicken between rounds.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.500]   You probably could use it with Popeyes.
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:20.860]   I mean, you don't have to use.
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:23.820]   Or just some sushi if you like warm sushi.
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:24.820]   What the?
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:31.220]   I just appreciate it because they understand gamers are living too healthy a lifestyle.
[02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:32.220]   This is hysterical.
[02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:34.220]   Isn't that great?
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:38.020]   Oh my God.
[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:39.020]   Where can I get this?
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:40.420]   I want to buy it now.
[02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:41.820]   It's not for sale yet.
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:43.620]   We're at least the last time I checked.
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:48.260]   Oh man, can you imagine we're doing the show and I just reach over and I open the door
[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:53.940]   on my PC and I pull out a nice piece of chicken.
[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:57.260]   Is it inside that drawer right that door right there?
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:58.260]   I don't own it.
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:19:59.260]   I don't know.
[02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:02.180]   Oh my God.
[02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:04.060]   This is the story of the day.
[02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:05.620]   I can't believe we missed it.
[02:20:05.620 --> 02:20:07.260]   I should have pitched it.
[02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:08.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:09.260]   No, that's all right.
[02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:12.140]   I think this will get in the show somehow.
[02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:15.620]   Maybe after the after hours part of the show.
[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:16.620]   Awesome.
[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:17.620]   How are you going about?
[02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:18.620]   There by Brianna.
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:19.620]   Thank you.
[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:20.620]   See you later.
[02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:21.620]   Bye bye.
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:22.820]   Oh, it's a knock.
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:25.980]   Oh, that's crazy.
[02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:33.380]   Inside the cooler master NC 100 chassis, they put a knock so that more space could be
[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:35.700]   devoted to fried chicken.
[02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:39.780]   The hell?
[02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:44.100]   That's cray cray.
[02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:47.580]   We're definitely getting one for the studio as soon as it comes out.
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:48.580]   Wow.
[02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:49.580]   Wow.
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:55.060]   Where's the chicken?
[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:56.060]   It's a portal.
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:21:01.940]   It's a chicken portal.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.140]   That's crazy.
[02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:10.540]   There's a picture of the world's first built in chicken chamber.
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:15.620]   I think it's right inside this door.
[02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:16.620]   Where's the schematics?
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.900]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:21.820]   That's the chicken chamber.
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:23.020]   You pull the little drawer out.
[02:21:23.020 --> 02:21:27.340]   You can't put much chicken in there.
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:33.300]   But that's why it stays warm because there's a fan here blowing up right through the chicken.
[02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:38.740]   Can you imagine how disgusting this PC must smell?
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:40.300]   Oh, my God.
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:41.900]   Well, it's got to be sealed.
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.900]   I can't.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.500]   You got a little.
[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:49.700]   You got a little drip tray.
[02:21:49.700 --> 02:21:52.500]   They probably will never make this right.
[02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:55.740]   There's no buy links on this.
[02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.820]   Introducing the KF console power.
[02:21:57.820 --> 02:21:59.420]   You're hungry.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:02.420]   Hunger.
[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:03.900]   This is an April Fool's joke.
[02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:04.580]   It has to be.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:14.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
