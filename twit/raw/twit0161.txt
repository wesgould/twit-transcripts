[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Thanks for having me.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And this is actually going to be another one of those
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   what's happening to the economy cast because Andrew Horowitz
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   is also here from the Disciplined Investor podcast,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   the movie, the audio book.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Hello Andrew.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Hello, thank you.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And Jason, thank you so much for playing me in the movie,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   by the way.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I appreciate that.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   You know what?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   That could actually, he could play you in the movie.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He has a voice.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He has a voice of a thousand.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Jason, can you imitate Devorak so well?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Give me a little Andrew.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I haven't worked on my Andrew, but catch me again during the
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Audible ad and I'll put it in.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He'll break it out.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   He'll break it out.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   No, no, no, if you want to have a good, good read, you probably
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   want to get the Jackwell just, you know, and the thing is
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   it's just frustrating because the people, everybody just
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   got me, it's going to bail it out and then it's the same story
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   over again.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And the guy who recorded this little diddy, you may recognize
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   it, the Jeff Smith is now officially a twit.

[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It's so good to be running.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Hey everybody.

[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   the bar right now?

[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   in hand.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Okay, that's appropriate.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Just in case we start talking about Devorak.org/blog.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Actually, this is going to be a show kind of about bailouts,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   about stock markets, about finances, and you may say,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   what does that have to do with tech?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   What does that have anything to do with tech?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Let me ask Jason Calicanis first.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Should we be worried is the tech crunch about to happen?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   This is going to have an impact.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's already happened already.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   There was a very wide open investment philosophy by VCs for
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   the last couple of years.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You know, try a lot of things, put a lot of money in.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Young people, less experienced, maybe give a couple million dollars
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to first-time entrepreneurs.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And you saw things like Y Combinator give 15, 20,000 to
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   a first-time entrepreneur.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And the reason that happens is because you have rich people
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   who are investing, they're called limited partners.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They have a little extra pocket cash.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah, I think you have angel investors and the angel
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   investor pool gets bigger as the economy gets better because
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   people are taking money from their houses and from their real
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   estate transactions and their stock market gains and saying,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   "Gee, I've got a little section of money, which did I do with it?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I shouldn't invest it."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Everybody thinks that they're a venture capitalist.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And so then you have massive amounts of things getting tried
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and that's why people go, "Oh, why is... who funded dogster?"
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   No offense to those.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's a cool site.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Actually, I shouldn't use that as an example, but you start to
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   see these weird things.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And that's an example of a weird thing that's actually been
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   successful, but then people go, "Why does the world need the
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   15th delicious?"
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And that's exactly what happened in the first bubble.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So you have a bubble in terms of the number of people pursuing
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   the same opportunity.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Does this look like 2000 to you?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So yeah, so you have to peel it back a little bit.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It is like that in terms of the number of people pursuing the
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   same opportunity, right?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   There's tons of copycat sites.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Everybody's doing a friend feed now.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Everybody's doing a Twitter.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So you see all those things.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But the difference is, the last time around, those companies all
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   had 10 to $50 million.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Some of them had $100 million.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So there were hundreds of people working at each of these
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   companies, thousands in some cases.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So when it became apparent that these companies couldn't get
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   funded anymore, there was a lot of fallout.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   The difference today is how many people work at, you know,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   friend feed or, you know, the 15th friend feed knockoff or the
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   15th Twitter knockoff.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It may only be five guys with no office space and, you know,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   five area on chairs.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So when they go out of business, they just steal the area and
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   chairs and go back to work.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It's been really good for the air on chair, a secondary market,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   however.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Just like it was last time.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So what you're going to see this time is instead of a lot of
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   people losing their jobs, you see a lot of websites go on life
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   support, you know, two people running a website.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But you can do that.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That's what's different.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You didn't have the IPO.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You don't have, you know, the investors, the vulture capitalists
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   descending on you.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So you can kind of struggle along for a while.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Cloth structure is totally different.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You put it on EC2 and you said it and forget it.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I mean, you don't have a $50,000 office lease.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You don't have a $25,000, you know, rack space contract or a
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   contract, you know, for your rack servers.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You know, in a way, can't you thank the original bubble for
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   things like EC2, all that overbuild that happened?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Absolutely.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's why all the fibers here, I mean, people can say what they
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   want about the bubble, but the fact is if you list like, you know,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   the top 20 internet companies in the world on a global basis, you
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   know, like 17 of them are American companies.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We overspent, we made a lot of mistakes and we took the lion
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   share of the market.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So now Andrew Horowitz, the last time you were here, you told me
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   to buy dollars.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I told you, yes, that was really good.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We made a lot of money on that actually.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And I told you to sell oil.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Remember that?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah, you did.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   That was great.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That was great.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Do any of those?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   No.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Listen, my portfolio is number two on the MSN strategy lab.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We're actually up 7% this year.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   7% and actually in the last month, we're up 5%.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The last week was a great week.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   We actually blew out a MasterCard and held Adobe even though it's
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   been up and down.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But you stuck with Visa, I hope.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yes, no, we didn't buy Visa.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   We shorted MasterCard.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Visa was a much better company.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Jeff Smith, much better.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Jeff Smith says, yes, thank you.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Actually in Nashville, they ran out of gas.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   What happened there?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.520]   Well, it sort of slowly happened and I think maybe because I was listening to some podcasts
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.360]   just about the doom and gloom of the economy that I kind of was keeping one eye open for
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.720]   this to happen anyways.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.440]   But they're blaming it on the pipeline down in the Gulf.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.760]   So it wasn't like a rumor.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.880]   It wasn't a phony run like when Johnny Carson said, you know, they're running out of toilet
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.720]   paper and everybody ran and bought too much toilet paper.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.200]   There really was, there were empty tanks.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   Empty.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   Yeah, there were.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.600]   I noticed first the map codes started going out when I saw like, you know, cash only.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.120]   Okay, cool, which is fine.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   I pay with cash.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.320]   But Orvis, I was at it.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   Don't forget Orvis, right.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.120]   They're safe and secure.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.280]   I'm sure.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.360]   I happened to, I typically go to this one shell station and to pick up, you know, the
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.560]   odds and ends and I just was ragging on the other gas station up the road and he's, and
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   he said, oh yeah, we're out of gas too.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   Wow.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.960]   So the next day I actually saw a gas station with gas.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.880]   I went ahead and filled up and about two days later, it kind of all hit the fan and lines
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.560]   and cops and everything.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.120]   And of course now it's, it's, it's coming in.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.360]   Then, you know, Monday we should have everything back to normal, I think.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.160]   I mean, I got some at Costco today and it was a very pleasurable experience.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.760]   They were handing out bottles of water and directing you.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   God bless Costco.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:17.200]   So Jason, should we worry about, I mean, it sounds like we can just hunker down and, and
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.400]   trickle on until this all blows over.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.600]   I mean, I, I think that there's a lot of innovation innovation left in America and we
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.640]   have the freest flowing economy.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   So you know, as John McCain keeps telling me, we've got great fundamentals.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.320]   Um, I mean, he's right, uh, about the fact that we are, our economic system as flawed
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.440]   as it is, um, is the most fluid of any in the world.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.340]   So when you have a fluid economic system, like we do for entrepreneurship, where people
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.040]   can basically go crazy.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.720]   You have things like people going crazy on Wall Street giving out and saying mortgages
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.440]   or the dotcom bubble.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.080]   These are like the virus strains of entrepreneurship.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.960]   Um, but so it's a, is it a, a necessary consequence of it?
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.160]   It seems, it seems to be.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.440]   I mean, you, you can't have huge successes like Google, you know, multi billion dollars
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.400]   of revenue in, you know, many billions of dollars in revenue in just, you know, 10 years
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.200]   as a company, you can't have that accelerated growth, that mad scientist growth without
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.960]   having a Frankenstein once in a while.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.040]   But you know, let me, let me give you, let me give you the analogy here.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.360]   You know, you have a forest that as everybody knows needs to burn down and kind of, uh,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.640]   you know, flush out all the badness and all the rot and all the problems, only to really
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.880]   rebuild itself in a much stronger sense one day.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   And that's kind of what's happening.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.720]   Unfortunately, unfortunately, they're not letting that happen.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.160]   They're not going to let that happen.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   And we are in.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   That's a huge mistake.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   We have managed forests.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.440]   So you're saying the gut, the huge government, Bala, by the way, I actually want to ask you
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   about it.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.320]   Again, this is not tech, but I want to ask you about this.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.600]   This government bailout bill says there is no oversight by the courts by anybody that
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.440]   that that I don't get me started here.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.360]   I'm going to tell you something we are about.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.920]   I'm writing an article right now for MSN.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.360]   It's going to be called something either King or the empire of Hank Paulson.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.640]   This is going to be the strongest man in the world.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.000]   He can say no to Hank Paulson.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Yep.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.320]   And by the way, you know, what's really fascinating.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   I find it so fascinating.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.840]   There's two companies left in the genre of gigantic brokers, if you will.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.600]   It's Morgan Stanley.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.560]   And right now it is Goldman Sachs.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.960]   The fascinating thing is right before my very eyes on, I believe it was Thursday, Goldman
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.600]   Sachs went down from about 1.10 to about 86 within maybe two minutes or so.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.760]   And what was really amazing about that was that immediately when that happened, the circuit
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.800]   breakers took over huge amounts of cash went in.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.880]   RTC announcements were made.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.720]   And you know the funny thing, you know what Hank Paulson's last job was?
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.280]   He was CEO of Goldman Sachs.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.080]   Oh, man.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   I find that interesting.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.440]   So taxpayers bailing out these rich financial firms for acting irresponsibly in a deregulated
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.720]   environment and nobody can say no to it.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   It's terrible.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.040]   Now, now they started with the short sellers.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.240]   I have, I have, I got to say something.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.560]   I am, my fingers are bloody how much I'm writing right now, but there are 799 financial
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.160]   companies that are on the do not short list right now.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.280]   You know, I think most people think that you, you're not allowed to short them.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.520]   No, this is a new thing.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.680]   But what's interesting is, this is this cow.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.600]   We found like 300 or 400 that are in the same genre that are announced to be shorted short
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   them quick.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   But Hank Paulson may come knocking at the door.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   Excuse me.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   Excuse me, Mr. Horowitz.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   You're not allowed to do that.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.120]   And you can't stop me.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.480]   And related news, the government's giving $10 billion to Yahoo to shore up their, you
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   know, web, sir.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   Oh, they don't want it there.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.160]   They're just very scared that Yahoo make, you know, lose more market share.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.560]   Also, they're giving 20 billion to deck to bring back.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.400]   Well, I got my five million for podcasting.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   Did you get yours?
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.840]   The original MP3 player is going to be brought back to.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.400]   Radio is getting $400 million from the government.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   So I'm gathering.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.160]   And then you guys, you're, I'm going to, Jeff, you and I will sit on the sidelines on this,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.320]   but you guys are both very involved in the markets.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.760]   That both of you are disagreeing with the notion that if we don't shore up the financial
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.280]   industry, we're dead meat.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.480]   You don't think they have to be doing this bailout.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.520]   Andrew, is it necessary?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.720]   It is, it is necessary only in the fact that if we want to make sure that, you know, we
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.120]   don't have a terrible collapse right now, but I have a question.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.800]   Who said that stocks should only go up?
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   I know what you're saying.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   We should have a collapse.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   You're saying we should have a collapse.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.160]   I don't want to really have a collapse that hurts everybody terribly, but it's inevitable
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   for what happened.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.040]   You cannot leverage and do what they did and what we did.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   And you know, like drunken sailors, Allah Bush and you can't do that.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.520]   And then at the same time, expect that on the back end that you're going to support it.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.960]   By the way, here's a thing.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.120]   I know 800 numbers, I find this humorous 800 numbers.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.560]   People say, I want to call you on 800 numbers.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.760]   Don't call me on my 800 number.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.760]   It costs me money.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   What do you mean?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760]   It's a free phone.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.360]   Yeah, free man, free somebody pays for it.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.840]   Who's going to pay the upwards of a trillion dollars to bail out these companies, which
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.560]   is just an estimate, by the way, a trillion.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   Who's going to pay for that?
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.200]   Jason, you feel the same way?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   This is.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.040]   Yeah, I mean, listen, I don't want to see anybody lose their homes and be out on the
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   street.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   So if it comes to,
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.840]   you're talking about bailing out homeowners.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.760]   Well, part of it is.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.400]   Part of it is the theory is, don't let these financial institutions go out so that, and
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.760]   buying these mortgages from them, that's sort of the...
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.560]   Well, for Freddie Mac, I can understand that.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.560]   But the...
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.040]   But Merrill, but Learson Lehman, I mean...
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.440]   What does this tell the people who behaved properly during this time?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   Yes.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.200]   There were banks who didn't do the wrong thing.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.240]   So the banks who didn't do the wrong thing get nothing.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.800]   And the banks that did the wrong thing are now those CEOs and those management teams,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.000]   sold tons of stock, made tons of money, and they got built out.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.800]   What we're going to do is we're going to turn the financial institutions into the airlines,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   where they just don't...
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.320]   The airlines don't think they can go out of business.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.920]   They're like, "Oh, yeah, we can just run this into the ground, keep taking our money
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.840]   out, and we'll get built out."
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   But it's all about...
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   You know what it is?
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   It's all about the trophies.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.120]   It's all about the trophies.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.560]   These days, I don't know how many have kids, but you take a kid and you go to the softball
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.480]   field or the baseball field or the soccer field.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.240]   Everybody gets a trophy no matter how crappy your kid is playing.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.680]   And the problem is that why?
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   Because they showed effort.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   And this is what...
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   I'm not even kidding about this.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.120]   The problem with all this is that no one's allowed to lose.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.240]   Everybody's supposed to be happy, happy.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   And we have this huge problem.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.120]   You know how much we screwed the rest of the world?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.600]   Because the rest of the world really didn't use credit like we used.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:39.440]   But we kind of gave him this little pixie dust, which was really a horribly tainted and toxic
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   drug.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.640]   And unfortunately, the situation is pretty bad.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.920]   And it's so intertwined right now that some people are even saying that we did it all
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.560]   for China because China was holding $500 billion of our treasuries.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.040]   And last week, there was a day that it was actually treasuries were so inexpensive.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   T-bills were so inexpensive that we actually were paying to have the ability to own them.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.760]   In other words, the government usually pays you, let's say, 2%.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.960]   They were less than zero.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.400]   They were less than zero because they were running for the hills.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.680]   And now we're going to be, by the way, today on the Treasury Board, we're talking about
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.680]   bailing out the international banks.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.240]   And we also put a guarantee in for the money markets.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.000]   You can't do this.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.560]   We're really screwing with the free market.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.280]   And when you do, it's very weird what's happened to the Republican Party.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.560]   I don't want to have this dovetail into politics, but it can't not.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.360]   Used to be about less government and free markets.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.680]   Now it's about more government and regulating markets and bailing out markets.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.280]   And this is the sort of, it's cronyism.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.240]   They're taking care of their guys.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.960]   And there's only other way to say it.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:53.400]   As a person who, tries to wrap my brain around this, could you at this point where we're
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.600]   at now, just back out and not metal so much?
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800]   There'd be a collapse, wouldn't there?
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.400]   I mean, wouldn't it just suddenly break?
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.920]   I mean, great depression and run on banks.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920]   What would happen?
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   Well, that's what's happening.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   We have a run on banks last week.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.720]   The money market, the reserve funds, money market went under a dollar.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   The Putnam funds closed down a 65 or so billion dollar, some large number of billion dollar
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   money market.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.440]   There is a run on banks right now.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.120]   Right now you go into a bank of America, ask all the people standing around.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   What are you doing?
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.360]   They're going to say, we're coming from Washington Mutual.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   We're coming from what?
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.360]   In Philadelphia.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   Right.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   And this, by the way, just to kind of bring this all around to all the techniques, which
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.560]   I feel a part of that I am one too.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.520]   How does this affect me?
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.160]   Well how it affects you is that the money is going to be drying up on investors, as Jason
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.640]   said to begin with.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   And when you look at some of the things that are going on, look at Apple stock last week.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   Apple stock hit $122.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.120]   Should be going up.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120]   Why is it going down?
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.960]   Well, because there's a lot of things going on.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   This is falling on.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   Consumers.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   Consumers.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   So they're not going to be buying iPods.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   Well, this is a property.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.520]   We've been propping up the consumer for a couple of years now.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.520]   These home equity lines, I mean, they were just, my mother got a home equity line.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   I said, why did you get it?
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.200]   She was like, well, it was like, you know, so adventurous and I, you know, I was going
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   to help you probably.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.680]   And I was like, you know, they're just selling people so hard on these things.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:17.400]   And the incentive for all the people doing these incentives on a street level are very
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   powerful.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.120]   So when you take all the street level salespeople and tell them, like, all you have to do is
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.560]   close and you get your money, then they just figure out every possible way to gain the
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   system.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:33.760]   And just all game the system to all hell, then it went up to their bosses with then they
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.800]   game the system as much as they could in terms of, you know, loosening and loosening the
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   covenants.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.440]   I mean, I had people coming to me, we raised, you know, a decent amount of venture capital
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   from a hollow.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.000]   I had people coming to me saying, can I give you a five or $10 million loan at no interest,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.480]   no covenants.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.920]   And so what Andrew will tell you about what covenants are, but, you know, essentially
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.520]   they're promises you have to make.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.720]   So when you take a loan as a business, like you have leverage, like how much money you
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.760]   make versus how much you spend and how much money you have in the bank and your e-bita,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.480]   all the stuff, they would just like take the money for free at this ridiculous interest
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   rate.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.160]   And I'm just sitting there like, why are these guys so aggressively doing this?
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   And I don't need the money.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.600]   So I just kept telling them, like, I have no interest in doing this.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.960]   And they just kept coming and coming.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.520]   I didn't do it, obviously, but money became essentially free.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.920]   As a layman, I was getting really the hard sell when we moved back to Nashville and we
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.760]   were getting a mortgage for a house here.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.360]   I mean, they were practically making fun of me for sticking with my guns and getting
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.320]   a 30 year fix as opposed to, oh, look at the rate to this thing.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   You gotta go.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   Come on, go for it.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.080]   And I just, you know, and I could have gotten something cheaper for, you know, but I'm so
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.240]   glad I stuck to my guns.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   But it was a rough go.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.880]   They were really on me.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.640]   And then, oh, here's my supervisor.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.040]   Oh, here's my, here's this thing.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.640]   And, you know, it was, whoa, it was actually the most stressful house buying that I've
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   had.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.200]   So is there a upside to this for the tech industry?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.880]   What's it going to get, paint us a picture, Jason, of what the next few years are going
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   to look like?
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.040]   This is, if you're an entrepreneur, this is going to be the greatest time to start a
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.480]   company because there'll be less competition and the best companies are built during down
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.080]   markets because that's where you could take markets.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   Look at Amazon.com.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.440]   They came out of the bus bigger, better than ever.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   Absolutely.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.040]   So, you know, for me, when, again, when I was starting with this company, I raised as much
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.400]   money as I could knowing that this was coming.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.080]   And now I'm sitting on a huge pile of cash with four years of runway to build the company
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.280]   out even if we don't make money.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.200]   So it's a great time to build web logs, Inc.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.520]   We built during the down market.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   There was no competition.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.680]   The only people who wanted to pay bloggers were us in Nick Denton.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440]   So that's when Engadget was built.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440]   That's when Joystick was built.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.800]   So the perfect thing to do would be to build value, build value, hunker down, don't expect
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.960]   to make any money.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.720]   Keep it going as long as you can.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.280]   Absolutely.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   And how long?
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   What's the time from four years, five years?
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.440]   How long am I going to have to, I have to podcast before I can make money again?
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.200]   Well, I think that you will build a major audience and, you know, it's going to be a
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.280]   tough market for at least 18 months.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   So save every penny I make here.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.920]   It could be three years of this.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   It could be.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.080]   The reason is, is more than just all about the money, it's all about that, you know, general
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.760]   complacency sets in when things are good, right?
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   It's too easy.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   You don't go to it.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.320]   Yeah, nobody goes to a doctor when everything feels good, right?
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.960]   So now, you know, I'm seeing record hits.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.680]   As a matter of fact, my website is down.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.720]   We launched a recent podcast today, the weekly podcast.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280]   It's being said so hard that we can't even get it to come back up.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.080]   Well, you picked a good time covering markets.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.680]   Well, I mean, I've been doing this for 20 something years.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   This is the worst situation I've ever seen in my life.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.880]   And who do people go to when there's trouble is the gurus and say, well, what do we do?
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.680]   Where do we put our money?
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.520]   What do we do with our money?
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.040]   You know, fortunately we have, we have, you know, some people, I mean, you know, you get
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.600]   Susie Orman giving out advice, which is Jason, can you do that imitation?
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.600]   Susie Orman?
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.760]   I bet I can do Jim Kramer.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.600]   Listen to me now.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.800]   You don't have the money for a Mercedes.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.080]   You have the money for a Honda Accord, for maybe seven.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.160]   Do you see only where 32 million?
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.960]   What do you think you're doing?
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.520]   Watch I go to TGI Fridays forget about the no boo.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.640]   So we're Susie says, Susie says, all right, we're going to take a break.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.560]   When we come back, Brad Pitt reading audio books, we're going to talk about Jerry Seinfeld
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.320]   out of work poor guy and a lot more.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.200]   But first I got to tell you about visa, our great friends at Visa sponsor this show because
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.600]   they believe, they believe in you, the people and your wisdom.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.440]   And they know when you go shopping now ever more than ever, you want to take care of your
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.600]   dollars, you want to pay attention, you want to make sure that every time you go shopping
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.040]   online, it's safe.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:53.560]   It's secure visa uses very sophisticated advanced technology for real time fraud monitoring.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.200]   They prevent they detect they resolve online fraud.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.560]   Should it happen?
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   And you're not liable.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.400]   That's the bottom line zero liability for unauthorized purchases.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.100]   I know maybe you're shopping a little less online, but when you do or off, but when you
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.960]   do and you're pulling out a credit card, just remember Andrew Horowitz is shorting the other
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   guy.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.920]   You want to make sure you use visa.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   That's peace of mind safe secure.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.800]   All right, I get it.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.680]   I've got to give him some credit for being safe and secure.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   No problems.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   They assure it's visa visa visa visa visa.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.480]   Oh yeah, sweet sounds of Jeff Smith.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.000]   You know, I never asked visa if we should use if we could use that for you have just
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.920]   spontaneously become, you know, you put that on your resume.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   Oh yeah, right.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.920]   I wrote jingles for visa.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   And they gave me a message right now.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.600]   Dovetail on this discussion about advice, you know, the fact of the matter is that it's
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.280]   interesting because, you know, when you look at mainstream media and you're looking what's
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.320]   going on out there and how homogenized the information is, and I don't know if anybody,
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.480]   you know, notices this, but you know, the cheerleaders out there on some of the stations
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   and all that.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.040]   And, you know, I got to tell you, I cannot tell you how many emails we get in and because,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   you know, I'm giving advice.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.960]   We tell you, okay, this stock is good.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.360]   This mutual thought is bad.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.880]   This is what you need to be looking at.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.800]   And I cannot tell you how good it feels, frankly.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.840]   I mean, not to kind of get, you know, wimpy on you here in Elle Wispy, but the fact of
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.120]   matter is that saving people so much money during this because nobody, I mean, really
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.760]   who's out there telling them, you know, where to go, what to look at, how to investigate
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.520]   their portfolios and, and you see Jim Kramer.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.000]   Jesus smart guy.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   There's no question about that.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.800]   I mean, I try to watch the damn thing.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   I can't.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   It just drives me nuts.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   He's like yelling and screaming and banging on things.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   He's definitely a smart guy.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.040]   I don't know if I would trade alongside him, but it's because I don't have the stomach
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   for it.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.720]   But to see NBC, it just seems like such a cheerleader and that.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.360]   It's just like, if that, why don't they make that?
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   If it's dedicated to finance, why don't they make it intelligent and well-thought out and
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   consider it?
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.960]   No, no, because I'll tell you why the trend and you look at MSNBC, it all started with
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.200]   Fox news.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.640]   The trend is to advocacy, not news anymore.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.520]   It's also all about the title.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.480]   You know that when I'm writing for MSN or whatever, I've learned you have to make a incredible
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.440]   title to bring people in because of my life.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   Linkbaiting.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   It is linkbaiting.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.960]   It's saying you're talking about linkbaiting of 50% on the story.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.240]   That's the problem with mainstream media.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.760]   They basically looked at what made blog special.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   Yeah, they're gaming.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.440]   Which was authenticity and they took, they did this sort of backwards reverse engineering
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.720]   and said, oh, you have to be an a-hole and ruffle people's feathers and then they start
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   doing it every story.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.040]   Is that why you stopped blogging, Jason?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.520]   Absolutely, because people started analyzing and people started crediting me with the creation
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.600]   of the concept of linkbaiting, which I'd never heard that term before somebody put it
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   on me.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.920]   And it's like, I think you, I think you though, you have a, it's, I'm not saying it's conscious,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.080]   but you are very good and Devorex of exactly the same, both of you have the same talent
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   for hitting hot buttons.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.520]   Yeah, well, you have an opinion and you stated, you know, provocatively.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.400]   And well, Devorex and I also, I think are extremely knowledgeable at the spaces we write
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.600]   about, not to, to our husband.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.080]   We know what we're talking about.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.080]   Absolutely.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   Nobody would read you if it would pure.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.080]   It's nobody would read you if you're linkbaiting.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.680]   Predobility plus passion equals, you know, something worth reading now.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.880]   And most people are who have credibility are too scared to go with their passion because
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.680]   they're afraid to look stupid or something like that.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.080]   Oh, well, that's a big thing.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.480]   How many times have you said stuff?
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.440]   I mean, maybe you're a little bit less caring because you're very, you know, you feel good
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.680]   about your opinion and all that.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.960]   But I got to tell you something in my business, so many people don't want to put themselves
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.720]   out there because you can be, you know, it's one thing to say in opinions, nothing to say,
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.920]   buy this or do that and then be wrong.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   But speaking about Devorex, by the way, we're doing little conversations.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   He and I over at Devorex dot org slash blog.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.640]   You did it.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.000]   How did you do that?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Drink, drink, drink.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Hold on.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.720]   I was like, John, did I do that right, John?
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   Okay, good.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.200]   He said his son's birthday party, by the way, that's why he's not.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   We've been doing conversations.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.520]   We did one on his site.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.040]   And may I suggest that it's a Harry Dent?
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.600]   Have you have you listened to Harry Dent at all?
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   Who is Harry Dent?
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   It sounds dirty.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.360]   Harry sounds like a porn name.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.960]   Not Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   Wow.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.840]   I think you just named the show.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.440]   Harry Dent is on my podcast this week.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.400]   Andrew has a Harry Dent.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.040]   Big Harry Dent.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.760]   And he, he, he talked about back in the, I think in the 90s, all about demographic economics
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.480]   and how the aging population is going to cause a huge, huge problem in 2000.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.080]   Yeah, you don't dare say that.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.080]   That's provocative.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   You don't dare say that.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   He has books out books and books and books.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.840]   His next book is called The Great Crash Ahead.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   Very encouraging.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.960]   That's what DeBorack's been saying, by the way, but he didn't think it would come this
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   fast.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.200]   He thought it'd be 2010, 2019, 2010, but this is it.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   And this guy is brilliant.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   I just, you know, if you have a chance to listen, I got to tell you it's unbelievable.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.000]   Aside from the fact that Jason, you were brilliant as well on the show.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.960]   Just, just really, were you guys just on a show together?
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.960]   Yeah, Jason, Jason, Jason.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   You did like a power.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.960]   It was like a conversation.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   Oh, man.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   So you're just re-asshing stuff you've already talked about.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   I apologize.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.520]   He was doing an interview with me, so it was more like a primer.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520]   But I'll tell you something.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.360]   It is pretty scary what's going on there.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.360]   But let's talk tech.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.840]   I'm so sick of talking about that.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.320]   No, and I only agree, absolutely.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   100%.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.160]   I brought this up because I was really most interested.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.200]   First of all, it's the biggest story of the last year.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.680]   And it does impact tech in the sense it impacts what's going to happen the next four years.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.840]   And it impacts all of us.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.320]   All of us have to think about, for instance, I have to think about, well, what do I do with
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.680]   Twit, how do I grow it, and I think you gave me some good advice, Jason, hunker down,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   spend as little as you can, build value, build audience.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:49.600]   The number one thing to do, and I'm writing an email about this is people get very depressed.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.440]   And that's what the other thing people don't want to talk about is the sort of depression
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.360]   that comes with entrepreneurship and sort of national depression.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   We're going through it.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   Yeah, we are.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.520]   I was in Austin over the weekend.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.920]   And it was like everybody was quiet.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   It was sad.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:10.720]   It's exactly what happened after 2001 with the market and also 9/11 and also the accounting
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.480]   scandals, all those things hitting at once.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.520]   And so what I've learned from this, and I went through horrible post-traumatic depression
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]   after 9/11.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.560]   My brother's a firefighter and a lot of his friends died and I basically could sleep
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.040]   and basically drank myself to sleep for a year.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.640]   And it was brutal.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.360]   And what I learned from that was is the best thing to do when you have these really depressing
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.760]   times is just to focus all your energy on the work you're doing and make something great
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.120]   and really celebrate the small victories.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.520]   And so in your case with what you're doing with your network, every time you can make
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.960]   the show a little bit better, the product a little better and some innovation, just focus
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.480]   on product.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.760]   Because at the end of the day, if the product gets better, then you get more sales, everything
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.480]   will improve and just stop worrying about the meta issues.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   Just turn it off.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   Don't look at Google Analytics.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.160]   Don't look at the stock market.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.880]   Don't look at all that stuff.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   Just look at the product.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.760]   That's my advice to all the entrepreneurs out there.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.120]   Is this a good time to, I mean, this is kind of a little bit vulturish, if you will.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.080]   But is it a good time to find those companies that may be going out of business and from
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.720]   a technology standpoint, they got to get rid of their computers and their systems and
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.320]   how do we go about doing that?
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.480]   Well, I mean, you'll just see that on eBay.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.960]   So when revision three goes, I should probably just go over there and get some of their equipment.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.920]   I think that's a great example of a business that wouldn't get funded today and wouldn't
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.960]   have got funded during the down market, but did get funded.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.080]   And now they've got the money to keep going, but they should not be spending it at a high
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.080]   rate.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   They burn rate, you got to bring the burn rate.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   They got to bring the burn rate.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   Yep.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.640]   Because it grows, right?
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   Doesn't it grow faster?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.560]   In other words, if your burn rate is high during these kind of situations, it can go
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.680]   even out of control even more.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.920]   Just focus on the winners.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   That's it.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   And that's what Nick Denton did by selling off some of his sort of meandering blogs, because
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.720]   it's not the cost of the blog so much or the cost of the show that's not working.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.200]   It's the opportunity cost that your attention is not going to win.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.600]   So if you have 20 shows, Leo, and it means the 15th through the 20th maybe are taking
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.920]   your attention away from number one through five, which could be doing really well.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.920]   So you have to double down.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.920]   I should probably do that.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.920]   I should probably do that, but I can't.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   There's like my children.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   They're my children.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   I can't.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   I can't do that.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   Sophie's choice.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   It is.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.840]   It's Sophie's choice.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.320]   I love them all.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.360]   So actually, there are a couple of things I want to talk to you about, Jason.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.680]   We never did talk after you gave up blogging.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.440]   I never really asked you about that.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   How has that been going?
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440]   You said, "I'm not going to blog anymore.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.160]   I'm going to send out emails."
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.240]   Is it too late to sign up for those emails?
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.440]   No, no, sign up for it.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   Tiny URL slash Jason's list.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.040]   I got to sign up for that right now.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.840]   I got like almost 6,000 people and like six weeks signed up for it.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.880]   Why is that better than blogging?
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.360]   I'll tell you why.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.040]   I had the same 10, 20 people commenting on every blog post.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.360]   Most of them were anonymous people who either I had some run in with or fired or something.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:12.640]   So basically, the 20 freaks and wackos that I basically have collected over the last 15
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.160]   years of my career are basically following me around the internet and just slamming me
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   on every blog.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   It gets really tiring.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.080]   I was like, "Where are all the intelligent people that I know?"
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.240]   So I started the email list and I get 100, 200, 300 responses to every email.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.880]   But they're not public for one thing.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   They're only to you.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.880]   They're not public.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   Yes.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.400]   These are from some of the most powerful people in the technology industry.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.000]   Write me back a page.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.280]   I'm like, "Wow, I am personally getting more out of this."
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.920]   What I realized was the joy I get out of writing is communicating with an individual and then
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   getting individual people back.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.720]   It's a little selfish though, Jason, because those comments are not now going out to the
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   public.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.960]   It is, but those people are not willing to put their comments out to the public any time.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   They wouldn't do it anyway.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   Okay.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   So what I'm thinking of doing now is, and it's basically collecting the best of responses
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.440]   and asking people- Maybe anonymize them or something.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.440]   No, no.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   Or just saying, yeah, exactly.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.040]   May I print this in a follow-up email to my list, either anonymously or publicly?
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:15.000]   Is this in a way that kind of the- In 1967, with a summer of love and then '68, it all
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.040]   came crashing down when the reality of what it means came home to us.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:26.480]   Is this in a way that kind of crash where- I'm with you and then the initial flush is,
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   we're going to communicate.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.280]   It's going to be a two-way conversation.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.040]   You'll write and people will talk back to you and you get this great two-way.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.200]   And then a couple of years later, maybe it's not been such a great exchange.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   Is that what's happening?
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.920]   I think it's collapsed on itself, to be honest, because what's happened is the social media
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.840]   optimizers are now saying, you have to basically attack one of the top 20 A-listers.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.600]   I'm using air quotes right now.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:57.760]   So the best way to get on the radar is to go onto tech meme, flame the top five people
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.560]   on tech meme.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.200]   So everybody's gaming the thing.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   It's like Linkbait.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   Exactly.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   And it's just not for a guy like me.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.480]   It's not worth it because I don't need any more exposure, right?
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   What I need is deeper relationships with important people or people who will be important or
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.920]   people who have important ideas, not even to be an elitist.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.040]   I just like people who have really something intelligent to say.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.640]   So on a purely mathematical basis, I am getting, I'm having a much better personal experience
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.200]   doing this than I am with blogging.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.880]   And blogging, I was getting a much better experience than when I was writing for magazines.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.640]   And so it's just a natural evolution for me.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.040]   I sort of look at it as going acoustic.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.760]   You know, I got up to the point of which I was playing stadium concerts.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.160]   And I hated it at a certain point because it's a grind and it's not personal.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.520]   And now I like playing the cafe.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   It's Jason Unlogged.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.800]   Well, and it's Jason, it's like you're saying, like if you're hunkering down in this time,
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.920]   it's also good to get rid of the stuff that's just noise.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.640]   And if all that kind of negativity is just noise and you want to focus on your, I mean,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:02.960]   it affects me creatively when I've got a bunch of negative stuff to look at it rather just
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.000]   focus on the one or two things that I do good, which is make music.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   It's true Jeff.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.600]   I just probably had to deal with this long before any of us had to deal with it.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.280]   I deal with it every night because I sing to drunk people.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.080]   All right, let's move on.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.960]   Speaking of drunk people, it's unclear what's happened here.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.280]   But of course we spent the last couple of episodes talking about the man love between
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.760]   Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.120]   And is that man love over?
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.160]   Is that relationship dead?
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.520]   But it's not clear.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.360]   Microsoft is not going to run any more of those for a while anyway.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.000]   Their agency has turned to a new kind of ad the response that everybody was expecting
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.680]   to Apple switch ads.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:49.960]   I'm a PC starts with a guy who looks just like John Hodgman in a quarter, a Jack and
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.040]   khaki pants and hush puppies is kind of rumpled saying, I'm a PC and you think you're seeing
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.320]   a Mac ad and all of a sudden it's people all over the world cool hip people who say they're
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.320]   using windows.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.840]   Actually, they don't say they're using windows.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   They say they're using a PC.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.600]   But who are these people?
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.320]   Because what you don't realize is a Mac is actually a personal computer.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.920]   Yeah, they're all using Macs.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.000]   If you are a Mac, then you are a PC.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.800]   I mean, who are these people?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.160]   Well, that's my question.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.920]   First of all, they didn't say windows, did they?
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   They say PC.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:27.160]   Well, second of all, is this is a mission for Microsoft that the Jerry Seinfeld Bill Gates
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.200]   ads were a flop.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   It may be.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   This is brilliant though.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   Help me out here.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.040]   When you're anybody write bicycles, you know, you write a bicycle and watch the bicycle race
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.800]   and you watch those two guys and you got one guy behind the other guy and he's draft.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   What's it called?
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   Drafts drafting.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.320]   This is exactly what Microsoft did.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.280]   They're drafting on the ads.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.200]   They drafted because now they can't we know they can't go in and they can't rip apple
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   into one, right?
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   They just can't.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   It's a big guy.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   No, no, no.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.640]   They would admit that they're worried about apple.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   Right.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.120]   But what they did is they took all the yes thing about yes on a PC on PC and all the popular
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   popularity of this whole thing and draft it and then came and now took a little bit of
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.720]   a move to the left and flew.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   Maybe I'm not saying they're.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.840]   You know, I think Andrew, that's a very good analysis.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.600]   I think that's exactly what they did.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.080]   What's great about this is when I did radio show way back when one of the things they
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.960]   always said was if you want to get some advertisers, always get the owner of the company to record
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.400]   the advertisement because they want to hear their voice over and over again and they'll
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.880]   stay on forever.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.240]   This whole thing, if you looked into this IMPC and this was at IMPC.lifewithoutwalls.com,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.760]   which I think what they're going at by the way, even with that silly sneaker commercial
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.840]   or the shoe was all about the fact that a Mac, when you get it, you can't do anything
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   with the Mac.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.760]   You know, you can't, there's no freedom, but with a PC, you can take it apart.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   You can put it back in.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.560]   Yeah, everybody talked about the kind of the semiotics of those first two commercials.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.480]   If there was a hidden message there, it was so buried, I don't think it was it.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   It didn't come across.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.760]   It's not like America went, you know, like, like somehow subconsciously absorbed the message
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   of that.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   This is IMPC.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.880]   Hello, I'm a PC and I've been made into a stereotype.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.520]   I'm a PC and I'm not what you call him.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.040]   I'm a PC and I wear glasses.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   I wear glasses.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.640]   I wear jeans and I study jeans and I design jeans and I design green buildings.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.440]   It's a pretty good ad I have to say.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.080]   Play the Steve Bommel on.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   You see that?
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.560]   Yeah, I'll find that one.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.560]   He says, I'm a PC.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   I'm a PC.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   I'm a PC.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.560]   It's very loud.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.280]   I mean, but here's what's beautiful about it.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.400]   They have it so that you can record your own I'm a PC and potentially be shown on the
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.560]   Times Square monitors.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.840]   And that's drawing people in who want to see themselves and the narcissists out there
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.520]   and all the other people that want to, you know, have their five minutes of fame.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.120]   But more so, they also have a live stream of Times Square showing the advertising.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.400]   I think it's a brilliant idea.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   I'm a church going to.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   The kind of sell PCs is the question.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   Oh, different story or I'm sorry.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.360]   By the way, a Mac is a PC.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.160]   Is it going to sell Windows is really the question.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.040]   I mean, I think this is like Coke and Pepsi.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.120]   Like, you know, I don't think these things are going to affect adoption of the product
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   either way.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   I don't think you're right.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.440]   You know, I think for the incumbent, it doesn't make a difference for the upstart Apple.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440]   It does.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.760]   But for the incumbent, I don't think it makes a difference.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.560]   Mike Harrington said an interesting thing.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.320]   He first was going to pan the ad, but then he realized it made him feel like the Apple
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.520]   ads were a little elitist and that maybe he wasn't going to be able to watch those Apple
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.400]   ads with the same kind of smug satisfaction as he had in the past.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.240]   Yeah, because also people said that the PC character was actually more endearing than
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   the hipster.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.560]   Well, that was obviously intentional.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.440]   I think Apple was frankly brilliant when they made the PC sympathetic.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.520]   If they'd made it a negative, Windows users would have been pissed off.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:01.160]   But this effectively killed the Apple ad in a way because now every single time the Apple
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.800]   ad is run, you're thinking about this ad.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   That's Mike Harrington's contention.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.600]   I only killed it that way, but killed it because you think, oh, they're snooty elitists.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.120]   Well, you know, this is like Ava's.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.600]   They started that ad campaign.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.440]   So sort of this like kung fu of repositioning and advertising.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   We're number two.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.440]   We're number two.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   We try harder.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.880]   And then after a while, it's got a little pissed off of that and made the net campaign
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.320]   where they're like, oh, yes, people have been talking about the number two thing.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.760]   By the way, here's we're number one.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   And here's why we're number one.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.040]   And then we're just like total judo flip.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   They're kung fu chop.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.680]   So that's what that's all that's happening here.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.040]   But what was the point of this?
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   Okay.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.120]   So you're what is there sufficient draft of this gate Seinfeld stuff to make it worth $10
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:47.520]   million to Jerry Seinfeld and befuntlement on the part of almost everybody who saw it was
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.840]   that is it or is it an example of Microsoft not going to know what the hell it's doing.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.640]   No, of course, Microsoft doesn't know what they're doing when it comes to comedy or any
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.600]   type of content creation.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.040]   That's not their strength.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.160]   But what they did with the company did do and I think it's a company that did the Burger
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.760]   King commercials, which are also like what the frat?
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   What are the Burger King?
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.840]   What are the telling with those?
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:15.680]   That's what that was when we had just basically disturbing like horror guys like it's the
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   Burger King guy.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.000]   Oh, yeah, but he's kind of really interesting looking.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Yeah, I didn't say anything.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It's kind of spooky, right?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Everybody talks about it like what's that about?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.840]   And then they these are the guys I think who did Subservient Chicken, which was that
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.240]   weird thing.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:35.680]   And so they're really masters of creating the WTF and the WTF makes you go gets us talking
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.040]   about attention and they get a lot of press from us.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.240]   What is the pension because they spend X amount on the air campaign.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.760]   They rise above the noise and they get X squared, X cubed, which is what I mean.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.840]   The fact that we're doing a 15 minute commercial for windows right now by talking about it,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   mission accomplished.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.480]   I think that's actually the goal is the WTF.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.040]   It's WTF based advertising.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.240]   Well, it got me interested after I saw the sign.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   I was like, well, now what?
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   What's the next one?
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   Okay.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.240]   Okay.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   No, that wasn't good either.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   Okay.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   Next one.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.440]   But we got us watching a three and a half a minute commercial.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.120]   Or in Feldman actually nailed it.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.840]   You know the guy from 1938, who does the this was really funny.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:24.200]   He nailed it because he basically said, Seinfeld was a show about nothing, right?
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   These are TV commercials about windows about nothing.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.760]   And so they're just taking where Seinfeld left off and continuing it.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   It's a commercial about nothing.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Well, we knew that.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   It's entertaining.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   It's entertaining.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.600]   Yeah, but it was obviously I mean, that's I can't think of any other reason to use Seinfeld.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.440]   I mean, you got finished with an episode of Seinfeld.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.240]   It was about going to get soup, but you know, and it made no sense.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.400]   This was about churros and shoes and living with people with a little old lady out of
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.720]   their car and it was we it was oddly it was oddly compelling, though.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.240]   You know, you couldn't help but watch it.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.880]   Yeah, it was not compelling.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   I was not compelling.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   It was odd.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.440]   Do you think there's some?
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.000]   You had to watch it at least once though.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I'm not I admit I didn't watch it 10 times.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   It's not like dick in a box that I just kept watching it over and over again.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   That's a whole different story.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.840]   Would you think they've got a bunch of stuff in the can somewhere that actually did go somewhere
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.320]   in the question now?
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.440]   It's been very unclear because initially, Microsoft said, no, it's over.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.280]   And then the agency said, no, it's not over.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.760]   We're just we're doing something else a little bit.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.800]   Are there and maybe this is part of the whole strategy.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   Maybe they just want us to say, well, where are the other ones and where can we see them?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:43.760]   I talked to my some of my friends over at the the mothership.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.200]   And they didn't seem to have much insight into they don't.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.920]   I mean, I think this is kept pretty close to the best.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   Or, you know, I don't know.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   Well, what are the okay?
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   So there I'm curious.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.960]   What do people on the Microsoft campus think about it?
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.480]   They must have had the same reaction, right?
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   What the?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.760]   I don't think many people are thrilled with the the Bill Gates commercial.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.720]   I mean, everybody was wondering, you know, we come out with something just grandiose and
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.960]   fantastic and what was that?
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.000]   I mean, you know, because they would be lovely feel pretty beaten up over the years.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Well, that's right.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   With this other stuff.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.440]   I mean, it's a bit humiliating at this point.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   That's right.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.320]   But maybe maybe they've done the perfect sounds like they've done the perfect judic judes
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:27.000]   at zoom move and they've drafted work could be the day the clown died.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.920]   You know, the, so that's the Jerry Lewis film where you played a clown taking Nazi.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.680]   They played a clown taking Jewish kids to their death and it was such an embarrassment
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.760]   that he bought every copy of it and nobody can ever see it.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.520]   But it's supposed to be the most revolting piece of film ever, you know, and when you're
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.200]   talking about Jerry Lewis's Earth that that's saying something.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.640]   What happens now with Yahoo?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.640]   I mean, the icon was on Bloomberg or some television show just a couple of days ago saying that
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.200]   this is more compelling and makes it even still in play now.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:05.000]   And I mean, Yahoo is in their shares are in the, in the dumper and nothing's happening.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.200]   Let's talk about, we're going to talk about the Google ad deal with Yahoo.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.960]   Mike Arrington, actually, no, it's Eric Schonfeld on the tech crunch block says the Google ad
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.080]   deal will only make Yahoo stronger.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.480]   If it doesn't kill them first, we're talking about that in just a second.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.800]   But first I want to mention our folks, our friends, our good friends at, you know what
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.600]   I'm talking about, Jason Calicanis.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.000]   Oh, don't tell me.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Say it.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Say the word.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.240]   You're not going to just pull out Audible, are you?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   Audible.com, baby.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.800]   Oh, man.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.480]   I was, I was playing poker last night.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.560]   And I lost a grand.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   It wasn't pretty.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   Oh, no.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:46.280]   But luckily I had spent a little bit of buying some poker books on Audible.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:52.440]   And so I was listening to Ace on the River, which an advanced poker guide by a guy named
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.960]   Barry Greenstein.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.800]   And I've also listened to, they have another one there, play poker like the pros by Phil
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   Helmuth.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   And this book looks great.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.320]   And, and, but you know, I like to listen to it because I don't have time to read all
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.320]   this stuff.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.520]   There's a lot of times when I'm not, you know, I'm online for a Starbucks or something.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.960]   And you know, you got that little like partial attention for 15 minutes, 10 minutes.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.920]   It's just so much nicer to read it on your eye.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.480]   And you have it on your iPhone now.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.120]   So it's just so simple, you know, you want to hear Barry's, Barry reading it.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.960]   You want to hear his subtle take on it.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.120]   I mean, that's the way you're playing, Jason.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   You could.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   I did that.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.920]   And it was actually surprising.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.760]   What I do is I keep it in my pocket.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.160]   I pause it when I'm in a hand.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.800]   And then I, you know, but nobody sees me do that.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.680]   And then when I'm out of the hand, I play it because it's too hard to keep two hands
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.880]   in your head.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.180]   But then I came upon a really great trick that I do now.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:50.560]   If you are at a poker table in a tournament, I put on my headphones, but I don't actually
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.400]   put any music on.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.560]   And everybody thinks and I start bobbing my head like I'm listening to everything.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   You're not listening.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.440]   You know, I'm listening and they start talking about me in the hands I'm playing.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.440]   So I'm in a tournament.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.000]   This guy's telling me this other guy like what a donkey I am.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.120]   So then I was like, Oh, I'm going to do a totally donkey move.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.680]   So I basically bet in, you know, add a position with nothing, you know, and I bet it down
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.360]   to the end and I lose like 200 bucks.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.960]   I turn over my cards and they're all like, I'm just like, what is this guy doing?
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.040]   And I just continue looking at my blackberry and bounce with the music.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.480]   And then I basically got my Kings.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   I hit my set boom.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   I wiped out two guys.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   Felt a don't boom.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   Beautiful.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   And that's all because of auto.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   And that's what audible is going to.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   This is the interesting thing.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   Audible is going to make you money.

[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   It seems like a lot of money.

[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.480]   Andrew, do you want to make a recommendation?
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.360]   Well, somebody said to me recently, have you ever had a book called the Reminiscence of
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.360]   a Stock Operator?
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.480]   And this is a book written back in the 20s.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.000]   And he said, you know what?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.360]   Before you say anything, you really should think about how amazing it is that this guy,
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.920]   everything he said back then is so pertinent to today.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.320]   It's like there was this kind of interesting parallel.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.560]   So it's great book.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.080]   It's back in the 20s.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.880]   It's from the 20s.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.880]   Wow.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.280]   Here is it's by Edwin LeFevre.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   Fevre.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   Wow.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.280]   And so you think it's timely even for today.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   Yeah, it's very timely for today because so many of the things, you know, when they
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.480]   say that history repeats itself, of course, but more so that everything is cyclical and
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.880]   you know, I just started reading it.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.800]   And I find it, it's fascinating.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.760]   I mean, just an interesting, interesting read.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.680]   I mean, I think I told you about a few of the other ones I read recently, but this one,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.560]   this one's a nice, you know, it kind of brings back some of the old, you know, realizing
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   that we're not alone.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.320]   It's not, we're not, we are an uncharted territory on one side, but yet at the same time, there
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.040]   are some very tried and true, you know, things that we can hang our hat on when it comes
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   to investing.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.520]   This says it's one of the, one of the all time great investment books.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   Yes.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:23.040]   To read from the twenties reminiscences of a stock operator by Edwin Lefevre and Ace on
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.040]   the river.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.800]   If you boy, now this is, there's a certain community to this, a certain, you're talking
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.920]   about stocks and poker and advanced poker guide to book, isn't cigar book.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.200]   We need a cigar book and we're set.

[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.760]   Just act that audible.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   Thank God.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   People.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.120]   These kind of times, right Jason?
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.200]   Well, you know, actually there's something to be said about that dove telling with the
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:24.160]   economic thing is if you're making any kind of content that helps, helps people save
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.000]   time, save money or entertains them.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.600]   I found those three things are very key and you know, you look at Twit, there's a lot
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.160]   of stuff that you can actually apply, you know, to your life that saves you time and
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   money.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.320]   We're essentially the vaudeville of the new Great Depression.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   Absolutely.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.240]   Come here and instead of looking at your portfolios.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.440]   I need some dancing girls.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   Here we go.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.440]   It's Twit Live.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   It's so fun.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   But see, that's good.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   Isn't it, Jeff?
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:53.800]   Because we're entertaining the poor downtrodden masses.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.000]   Everyone needs a smile, I guess, or a smile and a drink.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.800]   Do you notice, by the way, do you notice that in times like this that you, more people
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.120]   come to the bar and more people want to hear the music?
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.080]   Except for this weekend when no one could get there because there was no gas, but I
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.680]   haven't really noticed too much any difference.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.360]   And we're pretty fortunate to have really good businesses.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.640]   It's our third, me and some partners.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.320]   We have one in St. Louis and one in Phoenix and one here.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:24.960]   And I did notice, actually, it is interesting you say that when we first opened in St.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.520]   Louis, the first few months were kind of slow because it was a new bar and it was St.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.440]   Louis wasn't really a, it was our sort of testing city.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.240]   And we opened up in the summer and then September 11th hit and just we were like, oh, it's
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.240]   over this wall.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.240]   This is terrible.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.360]   This city, everyone just joined together.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.520]   Firefighters came out every week.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   You wanted to be with people.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.520]   You wanted to be.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.520]   You wanted to commiserate together.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.320]   And I hate to say that it took some kind of tragedy to sort of have our business turn
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:51:03.400]   around, but suddenly we were very, we were the place to go and then we didn't go backwards
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   fortunately.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   What's the name of the bar?
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   The Big Bang.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.400]   I like it.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.800]   It's kind of inappropriate for September 11th, but the first radio ad we did and I'd done
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.920]   it and it started with a big, like a big change.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.800]   And I remember my boss is like, you might want to lose the explosion.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.920]   But do you ever listen to audiobooks, Jeff?
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   I do actually.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   You're funny.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.400]   You're talking about saving time.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.560]   I was listening to that Tim Ferriss book, Four Hour Work Week.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:36.040]   Of course, it took me like three weeks to listen to it because I really, I only, I do
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   so much stuff.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.640]   I'm probably a bit like you, Leo, is that I say yes to so many things and I'm always
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.400]   reporting and I'm learning.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:49.560]   And I'm really need to, it would be nice to be more like Merlin Man, I guess.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.520]   But I admire him so much.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.040]   He's backed off so much stuff.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.040]   I just really admire that.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.560]   Can I tell you a story about Merlin Man?
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.560]   A true story?
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:04.120]   I was, I had a moment that I was so overwhelmed, just so overwhelmed with everything.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.800]   It was like coming out of, I mean, it was trying to take a, what do you say, a sip out
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.200]   of a fire hydrant.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.440]   I mean, things were coming out of everywhere.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.120]   And I said, I need help.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   I need help.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.520]   I find myself to be pretty organized.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.640]   I called up Merlin, who, you know, I know him through different circles and things.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.440]   He was gracious enough to spend some time and it was kind of almost like magical just
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   talking to Merlin, kind of cleaned everything up.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.280]   I don't know what that exactly was all about.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   Yes.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.280]   What a fantastic guy.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   He's our little elf of productivity.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   Yeah, he is.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:37.920]   He's just a great guy, a tremendous, just very soothing and just helped out and gave me some
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.480]   great pointers and tips and really kudos and thumbs up for Merlin.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:50.880]   You gave me a great article, by the way, on audiobooks in the delicious catalog, Andrew,
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:56.760]   that I really appreciate from Slate Magazine that says that with all the attention being
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:03.560]   paid to kindles and electronic books, the audiobook industry has been huge.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.800]   Fifteen percent of all books sold these days are now audiobooks, one billion dollars a
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   year.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.680]   This is a huge business.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.120]   And it's perfect timing for it.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:20.880]   They talk about sometimes, you know, you got to be careful about who you get to read them.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.040]   Sometimes they're good, but sometimes they're not so good.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:28.800]   They have one, the article is called "Read Me a Story, Brad Pitt."
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.760]   And I guess he's reading all the, you want to hear him reading in Spanish, all the pretty
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.920]   horses.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.600]   This is from Slate Magazine.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.720]   No man shall quietly against the wall watching that.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:44.720]   Dick Kreaman, chaotic, Akusato, El Hovin, he said.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   Oh, we mop.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:53.040]   Oh, soy, ma, De Narrow, soy, cock, ton, soy, cocky, ton.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.960]   Oh, Brad, I'm going to do French too, because that's really, I tell you, that is something
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   that is romantic.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.720]   Hey, Leo, yours were awesome.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   The one you played.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.160]   I don't know if it was awesome, but I had a fun doing it, but it's, you know, I did
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.040]   a little kids book for what I was ever going to do.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.040]   How long was that?
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.040]   Oh, it was like 15 minutes.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   Took me about half an hour to do it.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.120]   I said, I want to do two more takes because I just really wanted to work on it, but I
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.720]   hadn't seen it before.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.240]   But it was really fun to do it.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   It says a little, it's, you go in there.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   It's a little scary.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.800]   It's a little challenging because you know, it's going to, you know, live on and you got
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.440]   to do it right.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:32.160]   And three weeks, I was doing my book, Leo, three weeks.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.720]   And it's not fun.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.280]   And then retakes and redo's and it was, you know, and you get really self conscious because
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.240]   they keep telling you what a job you get self conscious.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   Exactly.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.400]   They're very nice about it, but they say, could you do it this way?
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   That'll, right.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   Exactly.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.600]   You couldn't quite understand that.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.840]   Are you listening?
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   I think you're listening.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   Right.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.240]   So what, what are those mouth noises that you're making?
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.120]   So the real question is why somebody didn't say, Brad, that's not Spanish.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.800]   Well, I don't know what that is.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.720]   You're talking there in Spanish.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   Reminds me of that really funny.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.960]   SNL skit with the Charlton Heston reading the, was it Charlton Heston reading the Madonna
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   book?
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.960]   Oh God.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.520]   That would be great.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   That would be great.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   I'd love to hear that.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.000]   So let's talk about the Google ad deal there.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.440]   It is now under your Justice Department scrutiny.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.680]   This is the deal with Yahoo.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.120]   I don't know.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.240]   Is there something to worry about with the two biggest online ad companies, the two biggest
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.520]   search companies doing deals with one another?
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.360]   Is this something to be scared of?
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.960]   Should I be worried about this, Jason?
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.440]   Um, hmm.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:43.880]   You should be worried about it if you're worried about like one company owning all of the operating
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.560]   system business, you know, on a theoretical level.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.720]   You know, if you, if you're concerned about monopolies, um, there are.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.080]   The theory being that if Yahoo starts to seed some of this business to Google, eventually
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.880]   Google just takes over.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.200]   You should think about monopolies.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.560]   That's interesting is it's, you know, it's, it's not illegal to have a monopoly.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.160]   It's, you know, that's okay.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.640]   Like you can be the greatest pizzeria in your town and have a hundred percent of the pizza
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   market.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.640]   You know, that's not the problem.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.240]   It's, uh, on, on a legal basis with the problem becomes how do you use it?
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.240]   Right.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   So you do anti competitive things.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.960]   If you do things like price fixing, if you do things like bundling or forcing people
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.640]   to do X, if they want to do Y.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.280]   And so, um, you know, if you run Microsoft with the windows operating system through
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.840]   that, obviously it didn't, wasn't kosher, right?
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:32.840]   And that's the settlements.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.840]   Right.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:39.360]   Uh, and also all the issues in Europe, which is a much finer filter, uh, than our government.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.920]   And since we're in a global economy, we, we sort of have that as the first trainer, uh,
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.520]   in these decisions with Google and Yahoo, you know, Yahoo doesn't have to use the ads.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.520]   They can mix it.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.040]   They're not locked in.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.760]   So if they want to use their ad network, Google's ad network has more coverage, right?
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.600]   So there's more ads in there.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.640]   So if Google, if Yahoo doesn't have an advertiser, they can show Google one.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   So it's more efficient.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:08.320]   Uh, in fact, the, the fear of course is Google all advertisers put their ads into Google
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:13.760]   and then Google places them across the entire, um, landscape, which is starting to happen,
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.840]   you know, uh, and so then says it's because of the auction system, uh, they don't set
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:19.840]   the prices.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.600]   So there's no fear of the monopoly.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.120]   50% true.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:30.440]   Um, they do, um, they do put in a floor for, you know, how much you can pay.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.760]   So that, you know, they've been raising that.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.760]   It used to be a penny.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.120]   I think it's now five cents.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:40.920]   Um, and just the nature of the, uh, space, there is already a floor of 19 cents a click
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.560]   or something, whatever the average click is.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.560]   Right.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.320]   It, that's sort of disingenuous.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:50.920]   Yes, they don't set the price, but, um, you know, and yes, the markets, you know, uh,
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.640]   sets it, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't do things that would be kind of dangerous.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.320]   So when you see this power accumulating in Google, that's when people start paying attention.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.600]   So that's, Brad Smith, Microsoft general counsel testified at Congress never before in the
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.440]   history of advertising has one company been in the position to control prices on up to
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.040]   90% of advertising in a single medium.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.720]   And he says that the money Yahoo's going to make is going to come out of the pockets of
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.600]   American business, big and small, who will pay higher prices.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   Not really true because they can not use the service.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   Now they can't get the reach without the service, but, uh, there are plenty of other advertising
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   venues.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   There's other places they could go.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   They could buy direct from the websites.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.360]   So it's not as Orwellian as they're making it out to be.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.840]   It's certainly not anywhere near.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.880]   It's far from a monopoly.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.640]   It's considering what, you know, Microsoft did with Dell and other people with 70% of
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:50.960]   a search of search advertising, which isn't anywhere near the bulk of all online advertising.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.520]   But if you, the way it's headed, the trajectory is that, you know, a large percentage, you
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.240]   know, overwhelming majority will go through Google.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.920]   And what happens is advertisers are going to be lazy.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.640]   And they're going to say, I want to dump my ads into Google and then let Google do the
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.160]   distribution for it.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.840]   And so what that means is they will get to the point at which they have a potentially
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.280]   monopolistic antitrust type of situation.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.840]   And you're seeing that already happen.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.800]   You know, Google's basically, I think they've done a bad job.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.080]   I don't think they're a bad company, but they've done a bad job in terms of projecting
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   themselves to the world.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.560]   They launched a browser.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.040]   They launched a Wikipedia killer and a Firefox killer at the same time they're trying to
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   do this deal.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   And it looks like they want to take over the world.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   Every single one.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.040]   Exactly.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.160]   It's just like they should, you know, the browser was probably a mistake.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.760]   They should have just kept supporting Firefox.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.600]   You know, the know was a disaster in my mind.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.800]   You know, why would you say that you're, it knows a competitor to what Mahalo is.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:50.960]   He's sort of, you know, the thing about know is anybody can create any page.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.400]   Mahalo will only have one day about audible one, one page about audible, not a hundred
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   or something.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.840]   So it's, it's slightly different.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.840]   But yeah, sure.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.160]   It's in the general area of Wikipedia, Mahalo.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.000]   But you know, as still, but it's just, as this whole thing matures.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.640]   As the whole advertising world matures, you know, right now it's easier, you know, to
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.920]   have a concentrated place just to put your ads in.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:17.320]   And I don't necessarily think that the Google, you know, those are kind of like throwaways.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.320]   You know, those are the excess.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.680]   Those are the pay for it.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.840]   You know, the problem I'm having with you.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.120]   They're not very foreground, are they?
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.760]   I mean, I don't know how effective they are, but I sure don't see.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.400]   I mean, the thing is that it's kind of like they're there and because right now it's very
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.920]   difficult to get up to the change of the advertising, you know, departments for any
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.000]   of these blogs, especially the smaller ones and websites.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.040]   And you have to have such a huge amount of downloads.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.920]   But I think the advertising world is waking up to it.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.080]   The thing that concerns me about all of this is, you know, whether or not the Chrome is
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.720]   a Firefox killer.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.960]   And I'm sure you brought this up sometime before.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.320]   This is really a concern that we have essentially an advertising company that now has access
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.560]   directly beyond what they have already in the plug-in with their Google task bar.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.320]   But they really have the ability to monitor and really look at advertising or consumer
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:15.360]   shopping habits to maybe not subliminally, but to put in a really good advertising campaigns
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.960]   that will unfortunately understand our buying habits.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   I don't know how comfortable I am with that.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.080]   They certainly know more about us than anybody.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.640]   And it does make me a little bit nervous.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.720]   And that's one of the criticisms of Chrome is that it is, you know, Google can use it
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.040]   to monitor not only what you're searching for now, but every site you go to since the
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.440]   search window is the same as the address bar and everything you type in there is sent
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.640]   back to Google, they can actually monitor every site you enter in.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.480]   Now, Leo, did they do the Chrome because they were coming out with the Android and that
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.200]   would be the browser for?
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   Does this something to do with this?
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   No, no, no.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   No, no, no.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.920]   I have to say I believe Google, isn't this funny, Jason and Andrew and Jeff, how we give
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.360]   Google a lot more credit than we do say a company like Microsoft or even a company
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360]   like Apple.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   We kind of want to believe-
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   It's based on behavior.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   No, but it's based on behavior.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.120]   I mean, Google has been very good about their search results being-
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   I can't.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.880]   We want to believe the best out of them.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.480]   I think it's also partly because we really want to use them.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.920]   And the implication that they might be spying on us is scary because we mean we couldn't
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   use the best search engine out there.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920]   But the-
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   I say the Apple.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920]   Yeah, well, it's true.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.840]   We forgive greatness, you know, like, I mean, Apple makes one of the most
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.120]   locked up product lines in the marketing.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   You have like all-
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.280]   It's like DRM heads like complaining about everything and they're running around with
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   Apple computers.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   Talk about Monopoly.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.720]   If you buy something on the iTunes Music Store, you have to play it on an iPod.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.320]   I mean, they've locked that solid.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   Believe it.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   Make an application.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320]   You got to get approved by them.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.040]   Oh, and this is a nightmare by the way.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.640]   The application process is really getting bad now.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.080]   There I can think of two applications that Apple says, "Oh no, that's our business.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.920]   One podcaster, which is a very good program that everybody which should have an eyes
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.400]   podcaster I think would be great on the iPhone."
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.440]   They've forbidden because, "Oh, that duplicates iTunes functionality."
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.800]   And then another is a web-based email package that the developer says, "Apple said, 'No,
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.880]   it duplicates our mail functionality on the phone.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   We don't want you to listen."
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.720]   Not to mention cut and paste, but that's a different-
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.040]   Obviously, that's more difficult than saving the world.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.920]   Not to mention cut and paste, exactly.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.400]   But Leo, do you see that news item that was in there about the deceptive advertising?
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.240]   And you got to look at that.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.920]   The speed of the three quote unquote, you got to use the quote unquote with the fingers.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.200]   3G compared to really the reality, the edge of the show.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.400]   I agree because I tell you what, I'm using 3G and sometimes it's slower than the edge.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.880]   But did you see the side-by-side video that I put up there in that ad?
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.560]   It's great because what it shows is side-by-side trying to have the commercial on TV and actually
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.960]   click the same buttons at the same speed with your 3G iPhone and it doesn't keep up.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   It's because your mileage may vary, but I think the day Apple would say, "Well, it
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.640]   just depends when you do it."
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.120]   I will say that I'd love the 3G because now Pandora works everywhere I go, which is
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.120]   totally cool.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.200]   Pandora, by the way, it's stereo until it gets shut down.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.960]   In stereo now, if you're on Wi-Fi, which is, I think, a big improvement.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.680]   I want to mention this Chrome thing and then we'll move on, but I believe, again, giving
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.560]   it Google perhaps Undo credit, that Chrome was simply a shot across the bow to other
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   browser companies saying, "Look, we want to do web-based applications.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.440]   You've got to improve your JavaScript performance.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.200]   You've got to improve your process handling.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.160]   We want you to make your browsers better so that Google Docs work better, the Gmail
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   works better."
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.160]   I think, really, that's as much about what Google's about.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.840]   And by the way, if you still want to use Chrome and you want to use a very fast browser,
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.640]   use the WebKit.org browser, which has all the speed benefits of Chrome and then some.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.280]   They've got a very fast job on Terra.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   I use WebKit.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   It's incredible.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.280]   It's lightning fast.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.040]   What I do now is I use three browsers.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.440]   I have Safari, WebKit, and Firefox open.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.040]   I use Firefox when I need to use the toolbars because it's the slowest.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.240]   I'll use WebKit for most of my stuff.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:08.360]   And then I'll use Safari because I need to have two Gmail instances open and two analytics
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.360]   pages open.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.400]   And if you have them in the same browser, it causes problems.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400]   But --
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.880]   No, I'm pretty much the same as you.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.080]   I don't have the Safari open, but I use both.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080]   I love WebKit.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:24.040]   Two years ago, I talked to Eric Schmidt and Larry Page at CES.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.080]   They had a little backroom thing with 10 journalists and bloggers.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.200]   And I said, "When is Google Office coming out?"
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.760]   And they were like, "We're not doing that."
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.320]   And I was like, "Well, when's the browser coming out and when are you doing an operating
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   system?"
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320]   They sort of laughed.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.840]   Six months later, they came out with Office, Word, and whatever.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.360]   Now they got the browser.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.080]   It's absolutely going to come to pass that they will use an operating system or a wrapped
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.360]   version of an open source operating system.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.120]   And they will give it for free to Dell and other places.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.760]   And when you buy a Dell, they will -- because we're already subsidizing Dell's and stuff
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.640]   like that with the search box, right?
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   And paying people.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:05.400]   So you'll be able to buy a PC for -- I'm going to say right now, 50% of the actual costs
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.040]   in the PC with all this stuff in it.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.520]   So if you think about One-Mom Tapper Child, they could give those away.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.800]   If it costs 200 to make it for 100 or if they get down to 100, they could get it to 50.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.160]   They could give away computers.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.760]   And they make money by location-based advertising and --
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.320]   Just advertising in general.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.320]   Absolutely.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.680]   And if you look at something like -- you know, it's interesting.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.240]   Bill Gross created Overture from IdealLab.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.880]   He had a company called FreePC.com.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.680]   I don't know if people remember it.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680]   That's right.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.560]   But it will come back to you.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.560]   It's inevitable.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.120]   The price of PCs go down to nothing.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.360]   The cloud is where all the applications are.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.600]   Every application and operating system is open source based and free.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.120]   Then you're just looking at hardware going down to almost nothing.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.560]   The tablet -- they might come a time when you join a bank and get a tablet computer for
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.320]   free, you know, kind of a situation.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.960]   Instead of the toaster.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   Exactly.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.680]   They'll be as valuable as toasters.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.200]   We're not -- where do you buy one anyway?
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   A toaster?
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.600]   No, a toaster I can live with.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   They're easy to buy a toaster.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.760]   It is to buy a computer.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   I went to three stores.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.840]   And where do you buy a computer anymore?
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840]   Online.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840]   I guess it's the only place.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.840]   So if you get a better --
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840]   Or a best buy.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.320]   I think best buy is probably selling quite a few.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.600]   I suggest getting an internet connection.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.040]   Best buy just bought an app store, didn't they?
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   Or are they?
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.840]   They want to do a music store.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   Oh boy.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   [laughter]
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.840]   Whatever.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.840]   Whatever.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.080]   What about the HTC Dream now?
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.720]   Android, Google's operating -- phone operating system is going to appear any day now on the
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.720]   HTC Dream.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.640]   There's a lot of -- I'm looking at the phone -- the pictures of the phone.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.360]   And it looks pretty darn clunky.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.480]   But in a way, this is what you're talking about because after all, it's a Google operating
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   system on a phone, location-based advertising.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.400]   Presumably, they'll have a good browser.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.880]   Presumably, they'll serve you Google ads.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.120]   Actually, they're going to charge 200 bucks for this.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.400]   They probably could give it away.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.240]   It looks kind of like a demented Zoom.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.600]   I don't like the -- I think it's clunky looking.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.920]   It looks like a very bizarre looking Zoom with buttons.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.280]   It looks -- you know, almost to me like maybe the Dell Axum.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.560]   It looks like something that came out in 1998.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.720]   But what's the -- I mean, where's the -- I mean, how come there's not more concern over
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.720]   this whole thing?
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   I mean --
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.720]   Google.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.720]   I mean, it seems like everybody's thinking, "Ah, it's really not going to happen.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.640]   And if it does, it's not a big deal.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.600]   And I mean, is this going to be -- it doesn't just need more of a YMAX?
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:36.040]   I mean, Google's stock is not doing anything exciting because of it.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.760]   Google is basically placing a bunch of bets on their second act.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   And you know --
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.680]   Ah, waiting to see which one takes.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   Absolutely.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:50.880]   So, you know, none of these projects will move the needle for Google because they're
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   original business.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880]   They're cash machine.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.600]   They have this -- you know, when you think about businesses, it's helpful to just think
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.600]   about it.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.080]   Imagine, like, a huge hanger, like an airplane hanger with a big machine that's five stories
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.840]   high that's just printing money, right?
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.520]   Microsoft had one of those.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520]   Google had one.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.720]   AOL had one with subscription revenue.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.880]   And so inside these big companies, you have this huge machine that's out of control.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.720]   Money just comes flying out of it.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.200]   And then they try to build other little machines in the hanger next door that eventually could
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.560]   be that big.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.000]   And so all of these projects, that's what it is.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.680]   Just trying to see if there's another huge money-making machine, a second hit they could
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680]   do.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.680]   And most companies never make a second money-making machine.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.760]   They usually just work that money-making machine until it breaks down, like AOL's with subscription
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.760]   revenue is breaking down.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.560]   So they're really doing something very smart.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.480]   They're saying, "Not only are we looking for a second act, but we're going to cast our
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.440]   net as wide as possible."
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   Absolutely.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.360]   Operating system, you know, browser.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:50.020]   And not only that, encourage our employees, give them 20% of their time to work on blue
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.680]   sky stuff, hoping that some of that might produce.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.560]   But if any of the major companies did this, if you had an advertising company, one of
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.080]   the biggest advertising companies, because Google's an advertising company, in my opinion,
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.080]   I mean, that's what they are.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.280]   Of course, of course, if it is, yeah.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.780]   If you have any of these major advertising companies around the country, I mean, whatever
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:17.080]   one, all of a sudden it's starting to put out an OS or putting out a phone or a phone.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.360]   I mean, people would be crazy.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.360]   What is wrong with you?
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.000]   Why are you getting out of your core competency?
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   What are you doing?
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   I mean, why?
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.600]   But for some reason, we all tolerated from Google because we've been Googleized or something.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.520]   You know, I mean, it's okay.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.600]   Well, that's because they make awesome products, right, that we use every day.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.920]   And they make a lot of money for shareholders.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   Which ones are those?
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   Which ones are you saying?
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920]   Well, okay.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   Search the ad network.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920]   Search the ad network Gmail.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   And you click on the ad.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   And YouTube.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   And YouTube.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.600]   I've clicked on ads before.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.960]   Most people click on ads don't know they're clicking on ads, but that's a whole other
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960]   episode.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.440]   You know where we make, you know where we make.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.080]   I only have Google ads in one place.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.400]   I've tried them on the front pages.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.920]   They don't really make much money.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.040]   They make, you know, the click through rate is almost 70% on search.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.120]   So when you search for something on our sites, it does a Google search because they do the
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.680]   better search, frankly, than the client software.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.080]   And you get a Google ad on top of it.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.320]   And people click those ads because they don't know that that's an ad.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.320]   Go to ask.com.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.040]   If you look at ask.com, I have a user lab at Mahalo where we like watch people use the
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   internet.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.080]   And we ask them in the user lab, show us what the ads are after they've done stuff.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.040]   On ask.com, like nobody knows their ads because they put them in the lightest shade.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.240]   And so when people, oh yeah, look at that.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.760]   It's so and it's so hard to mix the results with ads.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760]   Absolutely.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.920]   When you look at it, I just did a search.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.920]   Everybody go to ask.com.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.920]   Look at iPod.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.960]   The first couple of things that's comparison shopping, it's unlabeled.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.240]   Then you see official store iPod, right?
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.320]   Those are sponsored.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.000]   You can see the gray text.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   If you're on a Mac, can it see it?
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   Look at that.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.560]   You got to kind of move your eyes and see that.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560]   One tooth.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.280]   I think the first seven or eight links are ads.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.360]   Then if you go to the bottom, the last four or five or less five are ads.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.960]   And then so what happens?
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   I'm happy to keep you.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.680]   Yeah, but are they making any money?
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.680]   Yes.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.680]   Yes.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.320]   And the thing about the brilliance of it is when you see the deal.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.120]   Who uses ask for search?
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.320]   No, here's the funniest thing.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   These are Google ads.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.880]   These are Google ads.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:29.360]   And you, they have a deal, I guess, to not label them properly.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.000]   Yeah, because you're supposed to say that's a Google ad, right?
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.200]   Well, they don't have to.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.200]   They just have to label a sponsor.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200]   So I think that's why they have a huge ad.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   They say sponsored results.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.960]   I mean, the sponsor result is in minus three font.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.040]   You would never know it's an ad.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.840]   And when we show this to people in the lab, they don't know it's an ad.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.440]   But and why does it matter?
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.440]   Because they're going to Circuit City/IPod.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   They're going to support us.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.440]   They're looking for that anyway.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.200]   Look, if anyway, so when you see a company like ask about $100 million and you're like,
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200]   I don't understand the commercials.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.080]   It's like, well, everybody who comes to the site is monetized.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.600]   I bet you 50, maybe 75% of people who come to an ask page click on an ad.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.600]   Huge click through.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.080]   So what did you say their percentage of a search results?
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.040]   It's three or four percent.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.600]   So that's it sounds like nothing.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.600]   That makes it like a $5 billion market cap company.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.600]   I'll take it.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.320]   Every share of search is worth a billion dollars.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   Unbelievable.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.320]   If you could.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.760]   It's not the quality of Twit Leo.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   It's not the quality of search.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.680]   Not the quality, but a lot more money.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.880]   Well, that's why you see like, you know, cool with the search engine backed that, you
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.880]   know, had to.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   It would have ever happened to that.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   That was a quick and burn.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.640]   You know, being in the search base is a long heart.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.880]   Basically, it's a five year project to try to get 1% of market share, 2% of market share.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.880]   But that's a billion.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   A couple of billions.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.880]   It's good.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.800]   And you see we go from there, but you have Hakea, which was doing interesting stuff,
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.960]   Cool, which is doing interesting stuff, Power Set, which was bought.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.200]   You know, I mean, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.240]   in this because of that 1% promise.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.240]   That's slice.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   You just want that slice.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.240]   You don't need the pie.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.480]   We have 4.6 million people in August, you know.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.480]   That's actually huge.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   Yeah, but you know, that's unique.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   4.6 million uniques.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.800]   Record month in August, 4.6 million.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.640]   So on Mahalo, do you share like, for example, my page on Mahalo, do you do you share Lincoln?
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   I mean, I hit information a lot.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   Does that is that kind of stuff available for people?
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.320]   No, we I'm sort of a privacy advocate.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.600]   So we don't record any of the searches or any of that kind of stuff.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.640]   As a matter of fact, I'm going to make it part of the marketing campaign.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.120]   And I'm going to try to have to talk to lawyers about this, see if we can move to a system
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.440]   where we don't record IP address activity.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.680]   I mean, we do it for when people post comments and stuff like that for spam.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:46.080]   But I'm trying to think about if we can actually maybe set a new precedent of never recording
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   anything, you know, and make a business out of it.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.720]   So we're going to get back.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.600]   We're going to get back, Andrew, in just a second to your, your story from the Silicon
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:01.600]   Alley insider on the iPhone 3G and the fact that fewer people are using it.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   AT&T says much less bandwidth than we expected because according to Henry Blodgett, this is
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.320]   so crappy.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.680]   What is going on with Apple's 3G iPhone?
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.920]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.200]   But before we do this show brought to you by go to meeting.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.720]   Now you guys all do business meetings.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.560]   I'm sure Jason, you know, you got you're going to get the Tesla.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.920]   You probably will want to drive to business meetings.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.520]   I will drop to some business meetings in that car.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   Yes.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.520]   In that car.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   Sure.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520]   Why not?
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.320]   It's going to be a better idea not to drive around.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   Save the gas.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   Absolutely.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.360]   I'd like to do it from my office, but that's not possible.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.680]   Yes, it is.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   That's the beauty.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.560]   Gold and meeting and makes online meetings.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.880]   Not only easy to do, but really engaging.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.440]   If you've ever had a conference call and you sit on the conference call and you just
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.080]   know, you could tell when the guy starts, you know, playing solitaire or surfing or checking
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.440]   his email because he just kind of, you don't have to hear anything.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.520]   It just, no, he's not there.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.880]   He's not paying attention.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.960]   So you need a way to engage him on these conference calls and that's what GoToMeeting does.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.080]   GoToMeeting lets them see your computer desktop on their computer screen.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.400]   So they're seeing your PowerPoint.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   They're seeing your presentations.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.800]   You can collaborate on documents.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.920]   You can even do training.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.640]   You could even do that, that kind of user measurements that you're talking about by saying,
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.880]   "Okay, you click this page.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.200]   Now tell me what you see."
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.640]   Yeah, we should, we could do user labs over there.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.840]   You could do a user lab.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   This is how good this is.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.440]   I don't know if you've never, you know, there are other companies doing this and, you know,
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.720]   I want you to try the other ones, but I want you to also try GoToMeeting because I know
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.720]   we're going to win.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.920]   30 days absolutely free, a month of unlimited online meetings.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.160]   You show the boss, do it with some clients.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.440]   Go do it with the tough, the tough cells.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.920]   Do it with that guy who's playing solitaire, who's checking his email.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.360]   I think you'll see it's a complete transformative technology.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.240]   It changes the way we do business.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.360]   30 days free, go to GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.880]   Go to Meeting.com/twit.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.840]   30 days absolutely free.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.240]   And I think you'll agree online meetings are made so much easier, so much effective, more
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240]   effective with GoToMeeting.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.840]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.800]   I'm going to actually check real quickly.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.800]   Go to-
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   You know, Leo, what's interesting, the old days, you know, we used to use the various
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.040]   desktop clients like this and it was kind of, you know, was choppy, right?
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.000]   You know, you go on and you're terrible.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.880]   You know, 256 of best colors.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.360]   But, you know, I think a lot of people, because I introduced this for a few people, and they're
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   amazed.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.520]   They're like, well, we stopped using that kind of technology.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.920]   Right, because we tried remote access.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.920]   It was awful.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.280]   But these days, it's almost like a pass through.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.320]   It's unbelievable with a reasonable internet connection of any sort.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.440]   You know, you get this great connection and it's almost like, you know, especially when
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.880]   you go to a full screen mode, it's like you're right there.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.480]   I know it's kind of cool.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.160]   I was working on a speech.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.960]   Actually, Jason, I thank you.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960]   You son of a-
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   Yes.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.960]   Because-
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.480]   Thank you so much, Jason.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   So Jason gave a speech a couple of years in a row to the National Association of Broadcasters
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.320]   Radio Show for Jacobs.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   And I guess you were a little tired of it.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.480]   I don't know why.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.240]   But you said, let my friend Leo do it.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.880]   So you're sick to me on me.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.560]   Actually, it went really well.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560]   I was there.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560]   I just got back.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560]   I was there in Austin on Friday.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560]   It's a good group of people.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.400]   I mean, those are really like the guys who are making it happen in radio.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.920]   Well, they're the guys I need to talk to because of course, I'm trying to syndicate
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920]   my show.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.480]   You know, we're in 61 markets, but I want to get in a, you know, 161.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.280]   And thanks to you, I was able to talk to some of the biggest executives in broadcasting
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.200]   who by the way, love the show.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   They've never heard a twit.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.520]   They've never heard of netcasts, but they love the radio show.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.080]   So I think we're going to be able to get into those markets thanks to you, Jason.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.280]   But the bottom line was is we use Go to meeting to plan the speech.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.280]   Because we did, I did a talk with them that's called 60 ideas and 60 minutes.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.840]   So you get one minute each.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.160]   And we had, we really had to rehearse.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.200]   And there was no way we could have done that without going meeting.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.200]   I mean, you know what?
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.600]   We were doing the TechCrunch 50 conference.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:07.240]   I interviewed 250 companies and I gave them each 10 minutes to do like, you know, a Go
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240]   to meeting.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   Did you really?
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   Some of them.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   And I sat through 250 of these.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.240]   Oh, hell.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   It took three.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.440]   It took almost three weeks.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.840]   But you know, that's why the show was so great and had 50 really great.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.040]   Hey, let me ask you about TechCrunch 50.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.840]   First of all, you've sobered up.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.840]   We use Go to meeting.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.600]   I just want to make sure that people know that.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.600]   Go to meeting was the technology.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.600]   And it worked flawlessly.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.000]   So I have actually used the service all through August.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.200]   And I use the other competitors.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.840]   I have to say, Go to meetings the best.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.240]   Yeah, there's big companies own the other ones.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.240]   But Go to meeting really is they, you know, why Citrix actually had a lot to do with it.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.080]   Yeah, they got bought and a lot of good infrastructure.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.080]   But anyway, yeah.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.080]   Citrix is good.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.000]   So you've, you've, everything's good now.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.800]   We gave you a little hard time last week on Twitter.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.800]   I heard it.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.800]   I heard it.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.600]   I was going to hit off the treadmill.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.320]   Everybody, I mean, like, you know, this Kevin Rose shut up during that discussion?
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.600]   Yeah, because he's been, he's been clots so many times.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.600]   He's hit the edge.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.920]   He's been in Valley WAG more than a few times.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.360]   And I admit they're not the bastion.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.320]   I even said it of accredibility.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   But you did Twitter.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.240]   Yeah, it was this.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.240]   I don't drink.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.240]   People know that.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240]   I'm not like a big drinker.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240]   I mean, I do like a little.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.880]   Well, you don't drink or you're not a big drinker.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.880]   What is it?
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.320]   Well, I like a McCallen 18, 25 once in a while.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.320]   I will.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.560]   I will give you that and I will take a Monte crystal number for Havana.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.560]   Oh, baby.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.280]   Yeah, I'm just saying that's how I roll.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.080]   But so Mark Cuban comes to the show.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.080]   So he's a friend of mine.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.360]   We know he's an investor in Mahalo.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.560]   He was an investor in Web Logs Inc.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.760]   I've known him for 10 years.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.840]   We're good friends.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.640]   So I asked him come to the show last year and last minute he bals, right?
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.080]   So I look like an idiot to my to my partner on the conference, my Gary, and he's like,
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   oh, you have no credit.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.480]   He's busted my chops about it.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.640]   And I was like, listen, he's doing dancing with the stars.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   He can't come.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.840]   He's like, oh, he picked dancing over you and whatever.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.520]   So Mark was like, he's a real man.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.480]   She's like, I guarantee I'll be there next year.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480]   Do not worry.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.520]   So he comes and what's cool about Mark is he stays for the whole show.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.680]   So he was a judge for the morning session.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.600]   Then he hung out, looked at all the companies in the demo pit.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.120]   And then we had a couple.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.520]   Then there was like semantic, didn't really cool party and I had to be the MC and they
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.800]   had Jabber Walkies as great dance troupe.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.040]   And everybody's like, oh, the show is going so great.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   Congratulations.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040]   And we're two days in the show.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040]   Oh, have a shot.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040]   Here's a lemon drop.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.040]   And then lemon drops.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.280]   It was hot and the lemon drops taste like lemonade.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:33.960]   And you start like the six or seven lemon drop and you know, they're not as innocent as
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   they sound.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.960]   You know, you know, it's a little lemon drop.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:37.960]   You just like, really?
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   You drop a lemon.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.400]   You know what I'm like, okay, I'm a dropper.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:50.120]   You know, you know, you know, that moment when the world goes, whoosh, you know, like,
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:55.440]   so we're at the after party at the hotel lobby and it is just like people are going
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.720]   crazy and it, you know, if people are having shots, Cubans there and this person's there
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.440]   and Phil Kaplan from Edbright, I mean, everybody's there and all of a sudden I just had this
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.040]   moment and I look at my watch and I'm like, Oh my God, it's one o'clock.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.640]   So I just Twitter like, yo guys, I just, I am not going to be there in the morning.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   There's your mistake.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.600]   I don't even know what city I'm in.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.360]   You know, Twitter not the best way to disseminate that information.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.080]   Well, I didn't think anybody would read it.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080]   Yeah, of course.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.520]   The 34,000 people following me.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.040]   So but that just gives you an indication of how that I was.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.480]   So whatever, you know, I basically, I got there for, I got there an hour late.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.400]   Mike was supposed to host that morning anyway and it became a funny joke and it actually
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.040]   brought more attention to the show and the 50 companies.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.160]   So, you know, listen, I like to have a good time.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.400]   I don't have a drinking problem.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.440]   I know people are bringing that up.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.200]   I do have a poker problem.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.640]   He admits it.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.360]   He has a Tesla problem.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   Yes, I have a conspicuous consumption of car problem and I have a poker problem.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.640]   So if you'd like to tell me on that, that's fine.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.280]   You know, the amount I've been around you, Jason, I've never seen you drunk.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.800]   So the amount of like alcohol I've consumed with like Ed one day to like, you know, the
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.880]   average rock star's life, you know, literally, that's how much I've had in a lifetime.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.600]   So that's all calmed down about it.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.960]   I'm just glad you're having a good time and it sounds like TechCrunch 50 went well.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.920]   You guys are not going to do it on the same day as demo next year though.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.760]   You know, we didn't want to do it the same day as demo this year and there was a lot
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.360]   of theatrics about the competition.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:29.840]   But the truth is they moved their event up three weeks and we already had our space.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.840]   Oh, interesting.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:34.080]   So we announced after them, but it wasn't like we did it on purpose, but we didn't move
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.640]   it to, you know, avoid it because we had the space we wanted to use and whatever.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.000]   But I emailed Chris Shipley once I came Chris.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.240]   Congratulations on a great show.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240]   She had a great show.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.160]   It was a record year for them too.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.120]   There's room for both.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.560]   And our show was so much better and much better companies and we had 2,000 people and 5,000
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.600]   people watching the live stream concurrently at the peak.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.800]   So you know, and we had the much better companies because I would say 10 of the 50 companies
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]   were demo companies.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.480]   They had acceptance letters.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.360]   And they sent us the acceptance letters.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.520]   We looked at them and we approved them.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.080]   So what entrepreneur is going to pay $20,000 to be in San Diego?
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.400]   That's free to be a tech rush.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.400]   Free to be a tech rush.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.600]   And we had 2,000 people at our event.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.400]   I mean, it was huge.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.280]   So Jason, what happened with I saw something about disqualification due to a chip and somebody
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.360]   was gaming the lab.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360]   So we have this thing.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:27.280]   We had over 1,000 people applied 50 people make it to the main stage.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.080]   There are 150 companies that are really good, you know, who are the companies after the
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   50.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.520]   What we do is we invite them to come to the show.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.760]   We give them like half price to give them instead of a $3,000 taking $1,000 taking, which
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.400]   is essentially our cost.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.800]   We give them a free table internet connection electricity to set up.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.840]   And it's sort of like you just open your laptop on a little cocktail table.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.320]   And those are called the demo pick companies.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:55.600]   And then to make it even more fun, we give people poker chips and they can go the attendees
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.840]   and they go look at the demo companies and they put a poker chip and they can give one
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.120]   of their poker chips to each company every day.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.520]   And so that incentivizes them to go look at the company as it gets them a lot of traffic.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.680]   So the demo pick companies love it.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.760]   Whoever gets the most chips we put on stage.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:19.960]   And so then one company put a bunch of girls in like ridiculous strip addresses like really
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.920]   offensive like dresses and I don't want to single them out or whatever.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.120]   But like, you know, like dresses that are so skin tight and ridiculous that they leave
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.640]   nothing to the imagination.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.720]   And you know, that's fine if you're doing a car show.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.040]   It's not very cool at a internet show.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.560]   I mean, there are women in the industry who kind of like have worked hard, you know, whatever.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.000]   Anyway, I don't want to get into a whole gender thing.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.960]   But so then they go around with science like give us your chips.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.360]   So they're not even demoing the product.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.080]   They just were collecting chips from, you know, guys that's in a table and trying to
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.720]   like convince them to give chips.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.440]   And then two other companies, I think we're taking all their chips and putting them together,
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.240]   which was against the rules.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.840]   This became gaming, you know, like we're talking about the financial markets.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.880]   So we just want to make an executive decision.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.960]   I just said executive decision.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   Guess what?
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.960]   It's unethical.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.240]   My show with Mike, we decided you're out.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.560]   And if you don't like it, that's fine.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.240]   But you know, you know, that's it.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.640]   I think it's a good deal.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   I think it's fair.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.560]   And you know, the company that went up, there was a really great company.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.600]   We had like seven Israeli companies out of 50.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.760]   It was amazing.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.680]   But I'm really proud of the show.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.400]   You know, we had a lot of people who were underfunded or just I do, you know, the show makes
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   a little bit of money.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.040]   It takes a month of my time and I do all the rehearsals with the 50 companies.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.440]   So I meet with each company for a mandatory two rehearsals.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.880]   Most of them I do three, four, five rehearsals with 45 minutes each.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.520]   I mean, until I lose my voice.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.960]   The reason I do this is because as an out I was an outsider in the industry, as most
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.720]   people know, and I couldn't get any meetings.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.360]   I couldn't get on stage.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.640]   People didn't even want me at their conferences, frankly, you know, like I was like a pariah
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.200]   because of my attitude, you know, and my sort of vocalness.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.600]   And you know, this show, we've created a platform.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:05.600]   It's like Sundance, you know, anybody who's got a great film can present.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.160]   And now we've got all these companies that, you know, can't afford demo or can't afford
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.440]   to pay off another conference to get on stage for six minutes.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.640]   And it's a real misviving, you know, like it's good for the industry.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:26.560]   I, Vay, is such a good boy.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:34.400]   My shame.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.920]   The winner was Yammer.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.920]   Yammer.com.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.920]   It was very close.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   Good, good guide was second, I think.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:45.640]   And you know, Yammer is essentially Twitter for organization.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:52.840]   So you sign up and if you have like, you know, @mahalo or @ you know, twitlive.tv or @devorg.org.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.280]   As your email address, you can join your network.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.960]   And it's a private Twitter network for business.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.440]   So we, yes.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.160]   And it's awesome because people use hashtags.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.400]   So instead of asking you, what are you doing right now?
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.720]   It says, what are you working on?
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.520]   So everybody at Mahalo checks in two or three times a day what they're working on, but
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.000]   they use hashtags, you know, the pound symbol you see before a term.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.880]   People be like, oh, you know, I'm working on pound, you know, this or pound that.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.400]   So it might be like pound iPhone or pound search or pound this.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.480]   And then you click on it and you see everybody who's commenting.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.920]   What Conica said, it's really a nice feature.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.960]   It's basically, yeah, it's because it became a grassroots thing on Twitter, but it's not
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960]   supported on Twitter.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.680]   And I don't want that chatter out in the public.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.680]   So it's private chatter.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.680]   Guys built it.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.960]   It's so much better than Twitter in terms of how tight it is.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.760]   You know, it's like if Twitter was starting now and rebuilt the system from scratch is
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:52.440]   what they would build iPhone application, Adobe Air, desktop application, iPhone, Blackberry,
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.480]   and it's just awesome.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.440]   And their business model is the best part.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.200]   Does it do a like a map, a heat map?
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.200]   That would be cool.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.760]   Yeah, it does a cloud and it does it by seven days.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   That's two days, seven days, I wish Twitter army, right?
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760]   We're up right now.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.360]   It's crashed right now, but that's exactly what La Conica does.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.360]   You can see that.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.840]   But that's a really nice feature.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.000]   Now you said that a business model is interesting.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.440]   What is that business model?
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.440]   Very interesting.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:18.520]   So now if you want to have administrator privileges over your network, you, like if
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.080]   you own, you know, Devorg.org, if John wanted to control it, so everybody at Devorg.org
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.760]   can sign up.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:30.840]   And then if John wanted to control it and, you know, remove members or remove posts or,
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:35.400]   you know, be able to do other management style features, statistics, whatever, you know,
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:39.520]   sort of premium services, you pay a dollar per user per month.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.840]   So for a company that's got 500 people, it's $6,000 a year.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.120]   That's nothing for the value it provides.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.960]   And it's all automated.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.840]   So it's just an administrative, administrative rights versus the other one is just free for
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   all.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.560]   I mean, or, or Twitter is a free for all.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.560]   Twitter doesn't have.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.560]   And by the way, I have now officially 425 followers.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.800]   See, 100 more than when you started.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.240]   That's because I tell them everybody tell them to the Andrew Horowitz.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.240]   Tell them to join.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.040]   Give me a little push, guys.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.120]   I'll put it in the art.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.120]   You know what?
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:15.880]   The secret to my performances on Twitter, a Twitter is that I am in the IRC right now.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.600]   Oh, you watch it all.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   Oh, it's great.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.440]   Because there's so many people are like, "Calcannas, you're talking too long."
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.440]   And then I shut up.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.640]   None of the people are like, "Calcannas, talk about this more."
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:28.120]   Oh, you know, I'm sorry because I actually went in there and said, "Stop slamming Calicanas."
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.880]   So go ahead, please slam Calicanas.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   He's watching.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.680]   He wants to know what you think.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   I like that.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:40.360]   You know, it takes a certain kind of person to do this, especially with these two live
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:44.080]   chats because there's always, you know, back talk.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.000]   And sometimes I warn people, don't even look at the chat.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.520]   Some people get to take it pretty personally.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.480]   Oh, you can't, please.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.080]   I mean, listen, I mean, half was it, it's anonymous comments, right?
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.080]   And so, you know...
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.600]   If Jason took it personally, what all the bad things that people said about him, I mean,
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.600]   he would never come out.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.600]   Thanks.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.360]   He's got so much better now.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.040]   So, Kevin brought up one that I really liked.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.800]   Was that little pedometer one?
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.680]   I thought that was going to be a hit.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.680]   Fitbit.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680]   I love that.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.680]   Was that coming close?
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   Yeah, that was...
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.680]   What we did was we did this year five jury prizes, which were the highest rated by our
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:25.160]   jury of experts, which included Mark and Tristan and Marissa, Mayor, and we'll have you, Leo,
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:26.160]   next year, hopefully.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.160]   You invited me and I apologize.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.160]   I just couldn't do it.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.160]   Okay.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.160]   Next year, what I want to...
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.160]   Actually, I have an idea.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160]   We had so many people watching live.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.160]   I want to stream it.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.160]   I...
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.160]   No, no, I want you to be the host of the live things.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.840]   I like the Super Bowl or poker.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.840]   You would be like, "Oh, and Yammer had a really good thing.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840]   And what did you think?"
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840]   And you could be commenting on it.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   That'd be great.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840]   Like, sports are now sure.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840]   I'd love to do that.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   Like, Marv Albert.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840]   Yammer all from three.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.840]   That's the week.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840]   The slam.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]   Yes.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.840]   I think you may have a bite of your neck, please.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:55.840]   Yes.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.840]   You should do that, Jason.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.480]   I think you'd be very good at it.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.480]   Well, I got to host the main event, so I need...
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.480]   Oh, you're busy.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.680]   Fitbit is like a pedometer, but it sinks up to your computer.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.240]   I can't wait till that comes out.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.240]   That's going to be an awesome product.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.240]   It's so tiny.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.240]   The form factor is beautiful.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.000]   And there is, again, business model grade.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.880]   Like it's like a hundred bucks per thing.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   No subscription fees.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.440]   So you run around and it...
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.440]   Awesome.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.960]   You know, Leo, you need to have one of those that can count the bounces on your blue ball.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   It would.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   Fitbit would.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   That'd be good.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.520]   You keep it on and even keep it on at night and tells you if you've tossed and turned all
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.520]   night.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.520]   Really?
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:35.720]   Another great one was GoodGuide, which is GoodGuide.com.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.360]   And they are ranking products.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.960]   So if you go to GoodGuide.com right now, I'm really proud of this company.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:46.280]   I mean, there were like two companies, Causcast.org and GoodGuide.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.400]   I'm putting them in the IRC chatroom right now that we're really doing good things for
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.640]   the world.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:55.440]   And so you can go see like the top baby care products and they rank it and they go with
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.440]   healthy and green.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.440]   Exactly.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.000]   Oh, I love that.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.760]   Nobody's done this before.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.080]   And a lot of people argue this should have been the winner.
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.080]   And I...
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:11.000]   You know, the process of picking a winner and this is Mike and I decide and it's flawed.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000]   You know?
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   Well, it's just too good.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   It's just too good.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   It's just too good.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   You can't have...
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000]   They can't all be winners and obviously you had a lot of good quality of stuff.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   This is really nice.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.240]   You know, but I have to say, Jason, I'm glad you're doing TechCrunch 50, but it's got...
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.520]   It's got to be tough.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.200]   There is so much background noise now.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.240]   There are so many sites.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:30.600]   It's good that there are events like TechCrunch 50, but it's still very hard to rise up above
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.600]   the noise.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.440]   You know what though?
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.880]   It doesn't end at the event because a lot of these companies now have the ability to
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.280]   say I was a TechCrunch 50 company, which gets a meeting with any VC.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.920]   Literally, any VC will take a meeting with a TechCrunch 50 company.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   Right.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.280]   Gets them a meeting with any journalist.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.840]   So just being chosen as the 50 is sufficient.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.000]   Just like you were at Sundance.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.200]   You know, like if you were at Sundance and nobody reviews your film at Sundance or you
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.040]   don't get that much coverage, for the next year, up until when you come out, it's...
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.000]   It's going to be getting coverage.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.560]   Tonchi Dot was incredible.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   If we had an award for best presentation, Tonchi Dot would have won it.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.200]   And if we had an award for most innovative, what they do is you walk around with your
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.880]   iPhone and you point it and it puts tags on the real world.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   So it's almost like...
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.880]   I love that.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.720]   So like if you were walking by your studio, I could leave an audio tag.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:25.720]   So if I was outside your studio, I could look at it and I could click record and say,
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.040]   "Well, that's Leo's studio.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.600]   Notice the bottle of Jack Daniels on his desk.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.600]   It must be a rough week."
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.800]   How do you spell Tonchi Dot?
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   How do you spell that?
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.040]   It's a T-O-N-C-H-I-D-O-T.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.480]   But actually, I just...
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480]   Tagging the world.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.640]   This is a Japanese company.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640]   Well, it's Japanese.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.640]   That's the problem.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.960]   It's Japanese.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.600]   And what was great about it is we got these guys on the phone from Japan and I was just
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.240]   like, "This is incredible."
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.560]   I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   It's unbelievable.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   Works with the iPhone?
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.560]   Probably not.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560]   No, it is.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.560]   It's made for the iPhone.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.560]   I'm trying to find the video.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.560]   You have to watch the video.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560]   You know what's good about this?
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.160]   There is a lot of noise out there.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.040]   And there is so little guides.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:13.640]   It's really, truly really guides that are helping to differentiate and to put everything
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.000]   in its place so we can see what's happening.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.520]   We know that Google has this and we know that they have their labs and Microsoft has this.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.680]   But there's so much right underneath the big companies.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.880]   And especially from an investment standpoint, it's so, you know, aside from looking at the
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   balance sheets and looking at what they're going to do in the projections, look at the
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.760]   actually what they're doing.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.960]   It's a very difficult task unless you're really right along with the VC world, et cetera.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:40.280]   So I think there's a great thing where you can really have the opportunity for someone
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.080]   to, you know, as arbitrary as it may be and how, you know, we may have, you know, the
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:48.480]   two of you being at the top and maybe that isn't the most arbitrary and looking at your
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.480]   taste.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.480]   But still, I think it's a very good thing to help out the rest of us to understand what's
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.520]   out there and what can be breaking out as as the next generation of really great technology.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.360]   So once you've tagged something, it actually remembers that it's been tagged and they will
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.440]   they will they will float up as you look through your camera.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.200]   As you look through your iPhone.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.200]   Oh my God, this is amazing.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.200]   You are.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.200]   You have to watch the video.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.440]   We're watching it right now.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.440]   No, it's on the screen right now.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.040]   You have to watch the video of them.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.280]   Oh, you're watching it on.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.080]   The video they did, the presentation they did was so entertaining.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:28.640]   That it brought the house down and they asked them like, are you watching the video right
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:29.640]   now?
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.640]   So there you see it like they're talking about.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.640]   It's about again.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   How do you spell it again?
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.840]   Well, it's called T-O-N-C-H-I-D-O-T.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:39.440]   But if you go to TechCrunch 50 and then you click on the company, you'll see all the companies
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.720]   listed there and the presentation from the show is there.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:44.600]   So you can actually watch the presentation they did at the show.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.600]   So if you can't afford it.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.600]   I would have said this is fake.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.400]   I mean, I would have looked at this and I said, oh, that's cool.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   But they faked that.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.160]   There's no way it could do this.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.040]   The phone knows where you are, right?
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040]   And it knows what angle you're holding it.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   Again.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.040]   And it can.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.040]   I know that's amazing.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.040]   That is about the cutest thing.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.760]   I don't know how you'd be able to use it, but what is that?
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.760]   That really is amazing.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.760]   Well, imagine if you just put Wikipedia through it and you geo-tagged it anymore.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.160]   You had Flickr photos and you're pointing it and you see other Flickr photos.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.160]   See people's comments.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.440]   I guess you can record comments.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.440]   You post opinions.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.440]   Wow.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.440]   Well, this is the thing.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.680]   You know, you go through the companies, the thousand companies that apply, but really
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680]   good.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.760]   And you gave yammer.com the best of show.
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:25.960]   Well, yammer, see, the thing is we pick what we think is going to be the best business.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.360]   You might be right about that.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.600]   This conception of, because there was another company called Swipe, which you have to watch
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.600]   the video for that.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.840]   I mean, Swipe is by the guy who did T9, the predictive text.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:36.840]   I love T9.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:38.840]   Use it all the time.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   You have to see Swipe.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.840]   I mean, this is going to blow your mind.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.920]   Swipe, you have a keypad.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.400]   You take a pen and you run it across.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:51.120]   So if you wanted to type Leo, you would just start on L, run over to the E, run over to
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.680]   the O, pick it up.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.000]   And it would recognize the path you took across the keyboard and you could do it with a pen,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.560]   like a stylist, or you could do it with your finger and it works.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.120]   And you can do 50 words a minute, just running your finger all over it.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:07.120]   There you go.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   You see it.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120]   So it's just your base, basically.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   Right.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120]   But yeah, you're just running across the street and that's...
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.120]   Well, we need something better.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:15.760]   I have to say we need something a lot better than the iPhone keyboard.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.360]   So Tim O'Reilly ran up to say, "I want to see that.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.360]   I want to use that."
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.280]   Well, Tim was a judge and he came up and I told the judge, "Hey, why don't you try using
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.040]   it so that you can tell that there's no funny business going on here."
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:34.160]   But the thing is about the event and trying to get across to people is this is our view
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160]   of the world.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.600]   It's flawed in that way, but it's also in some ways going to be brilliant at moments.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:45.080]   And other people can start competing events as far as it's flawed in some way.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.920]   If somebody wants to do one of the company can't have any funding, they've got to be
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.240]   totally two people, go start it.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.240]   Do that.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.240]   Sure.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.200]   And if you don't think we picked the right winner, Mike and I put up $25,000 each to the
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.200]   winner.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.200]   So we think I $50,000.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.320]   I'm telling anybody right now who's listening, any company that wants to put up a prize for
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:07.040]   the winner, they can put up five or 10 or $100,000 whatever they want to do, and they can pick
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.040]   their own winner.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.360]   It could be the Twit winner.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.760]   You could pick the Twit winner.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.120]   I don't open source it.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.240]   If you want to create all kinds of things, also all the videos are out and they're all
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.240]   creative comments.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.040]   So you can watch all 50 companies.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:23.080]   If somebody right now wants to take last year's companies, put them on a site, create a voting
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.720]   form and create a panel of experts and pick another winner and give them a prize.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:29.720]   Go for it.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.880]   See how it's interesting about this, Leo.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:34.000]   They have, I'm looking at the TechCrunch 50 now and on the Tonshi Dot.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.680]   The funding for this whole thing was only $55,000 according to this right above the video, which
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.960]   is amazing to say that $55,000 total funding compared to the millions and billions that
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:48.600]   be spent on all sorts of other garbage that's out there.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.560]   I like the idea that what you're really doing is you're just giving people a chance to get
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.600]   the message out there and be seen.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.880]   And if they've done something really innovative, give them a chance to reach out to the world.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.680]   I think that that's actually an altruistic thing.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.240]   I like the idea.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.240]   That's why I started it.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.120]   It's like this doesn't move the needle for me.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.000]   It takes all my time.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.400]   It's 250 go to meetings.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.960]   Dude, it was brutal.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:16.640]   And some of them were horrific.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.640]   Some of them were horrific.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:18.640]   You look great on tape.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.360]   You're sitting through and you're like, "Oh my God, what do I tell this person?"
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.000]   "Loser, you need a big gong."
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000]   Is that kind of like the, what's showing?
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.160]   I'm throwing a blank now.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   You have the show with American Idol.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160]   You got American Idol.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.160]   He's the Simon Cowell.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.960]   You'd be a great Simon Cowell.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   That's what we based it on.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.160]   It's got a little American Idol.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.120]   It's got a little bit of a gong show.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.280]   But last year we had 1,000 people, 40 companies today.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   This year we had 2,000 people.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.800]   You'll have 10 next year.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:46.800]   This is an interesting show.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.800]   You should make this a reality show.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:48.800]   You should make this a reality show.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.800]   You know that's exactly right.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.280]   This would be a great reality show.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   It would be great.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.400]   You know it's interesting you bring that up.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.400]   No comment right now.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.000]   Well, that's a comment in itself, isn't it?
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   I think so.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.840]   Jeff Smith is the Jeff Smith.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.680]   G-E-O-F-F Smith.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:08.280]   He does all of our great music for the Twitch one, not all of it.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.280]   But he did a...
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.800]   I can't play feeling droopy because, well, why not?
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.240]   Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.440]   Even though they didn't sponsor this, they're going to free plug thanks to Jeff Smith.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.440]   Yeah Drobo.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.880]   They owe you now big time.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.880]   Oh yeah.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.000]   I actually get one.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.360]   I have too much music that I'm making now.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.240]   I wish I'd had one on my server before I cry.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.400]   You know, it's so funny.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:34.960]   Because when you lose data, as I did this week when my...
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:41.320]   I just kind of a horrible confluence of bad karma and juju, lost everything on the servers.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:42.960]   We're going to recover a bit by bit.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.600]   But of course, you know, after I've been doing all these ads for Drobo and Karma night, what
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.600]   do I get?
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.800]   8,000 Twitter's saying, "Didn't use Drobo, huh?
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.840]   I forgot you said you're coming, hey?
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:55.840]   Fail.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:56.840]   Fail.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.840]   Fail.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.840]   Fail.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.840]   Fail.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.840]   Fail.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.920]   Anyway, Jeff is at thejefsmith.com.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.680]   You can find all his music there.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.600]   Next time we'll have you on a music show, not a money show, and these guys will shut
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.600]   up and you could talk.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:11.600]   How about that, Jeff?
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.600]   Music should lead to money.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.120]   No, it's just funny.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.120]   It's just...
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120]   It's just Smith, dream on.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.120]   You know, it's right.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.920]   No, unless you get kind of nitchy, you know, which is, you know, that's a whole other topic
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920]   down the road.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920]   Nitchy, you get.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920]   Yeah, feeling nitchy.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.240]   I mean, you know, we talked about it when I saw you in Vegas about, you know, where
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:37.760]   my aspirations to get a big deal and... or was it to kind of take my time and kick back
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.760]   and hunker down, as you will.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.000]   And that's kind of why I started Ringtone Feeder, you know, real easy to get off the
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.080]   ground and very already being really cool to me.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.960]   And same thing with the music that I make.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:50.960]   So...
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.840]   That would have been a good TechCrunch 50.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.840]   Ringtonefeeder.com.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.400]   Well, we'll come next time.
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.120]   Make original Ringtones and then you sell them.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.600]   No, here's the cool thing.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.560]   You subscribe to them in iTunes.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.200]   It's a paid RSS feed and you automatically get a new one.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200]   How often?
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]   Every month, Jeff, every week.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200]   No, every week.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.520]   Every week you get too new.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.520]   And it's...
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:15.520]   They're all different ones.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.840]   One of them is a silly song that I do.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:20.080]   One of them is, you know, typical...
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.840]   Do, do, do, do digital.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:24.800]   The cool thing is that we actually open the doors for suggestions.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.560]   So we don't have a chat room.
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.080]   We actually just have email suggestions.
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:32.560]   So I'm constantly making new things all the time.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:33.560]   They're songs.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.560]   It's a really good idea, Jeff.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:36.320]   I didn't realize this is all yours.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.120]   I thought you were making stuff for it.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.280]   But this is your actual business.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280]   Yeah, this is...
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.280]   Good for you.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   There's a guy...
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.800]   A friend of mine named Klaus Lovegreen approached me about it because he'd heard my jingles
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.960]   and stuff when that's kind of how I got attention with him.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:56.160]   And he's a real good organizer and I'm a crazy, brainy, crazy non-brainy musician.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.240]   So we thought, "Well, let's take ringtones in a totally different way.
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:04.240]   It doesn't have to be a clip of a popular song.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240]   It could be."
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.920]   And we actually are working currently with other artists as well.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:14.840]   I mean, it's actually the site Ringtone Feeder is spawning off to, like, my album, the subscription
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.640]   version of my album that I just put out.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.640]   So it's...
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:20.720]   Everything's based off of this premium RSS subscription.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.960]   That's a very interesting concept.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:23.960]   And do you have to get iTunes?
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:26.760]   You don't have to have anything to do with Apple or iTunes to do that.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.760]   No, that's the...
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.520]   It's just an RSS feed.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:30.680]   It's an RSS feed.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.280]   I do a weekly video blog every week that the new tones come out.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.480]   I'll do a little video blog and I'll play it in the video.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.080]   "Hey, this is what I'm doing this week."
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.080]   It's funny.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.640]   We talked about the gas this week.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.520]   Someone emailed me and said, "Hey, can you make a ringtone that's reggae and that makes
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.960]   me feel good because I'm depressed about the economy.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.960]   How about that?"
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:50.960]   I did that.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:51.960]   That's cool.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.680]   Some people say, "Hey, could you get rid of the lousy telephone noise and so we've decided
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.160]   to have different versions of the ringtones?"
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.200]   And now, actually, next week, we'll have...
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.000]   We're launching another archive access to everything we've made.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.960]   So I mean, you theoretically get 300 ringtones for...
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:13.760]   I mean, it's two bucks a month and it's 20 bucks a year.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.240]   I think it's a pretty cool deal.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.960]   It's kind of like little pop songs.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960]   It's not really ringtones.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.520]   I call them like 20 second pop songs.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.520]   I'm a subscriber.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.520]   I subscribe.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.920]   Ringtonefeeder.com, thejeffsmith.com.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.280]   Andrew Horowitz is the disciplined investor.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.280]   In this case, discipline means short everything in sight, right Andrew?
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:37.640]   Well, except for those 799 companies.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.680]   But you can't short them until October 2nd and then who knows what the feeding friend
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.680]   is going to be on that.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.760]   Yeah, if they're going to do that, they can never lift that because then it's crazy.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.760]   I don't know.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.280]   They say they're going to lift it and it's going to be crazy.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.120]   Things are out of hand as it is.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:59.440]   It's going to get crazier as we progress and especially with Mr. Paulson taking over the
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.440]   world, it seems.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:09.160]   But if I can ask anybody if you want to be the part of the army of 400 for Twitter, I'm
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.440]   going to put out a lot of good stuff this week.
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.520]   Give away free stuff.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.280]   That's how Kevin Rose beat me.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.520]   What does he give or name your vice presidential candidate?
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.600]   That's how Barack Obama beat me.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.240]   Ah, really he's leading you?
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.240]   That's not fair.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.240]   That's not right.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.240]   It's not right.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.240]   Not right.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.480]   No, I got to give away a vice president.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.480]   Then I'd be on top.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.480]   The dis...
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.480]   What would you select that vice president of Twitter?
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   I mean, you'd have to.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.480]   That would be a tough one.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.480]   I think Molly.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.480]   Molly would.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.720]   You got to go with Molly.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:39.720]   Molly would.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.240]   She's got a shower about the debate.
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:43.400]   She'd have to put the tongue piercing and the tattoos back.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.480]   But other than that, I heard that last week.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.880]   I love Molly would.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:50.880]   I heart her big time.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.880]   Right.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:52.880]   She'd have a tattoo.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:53.880]   Do you have any ink?
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:54.880]   Two inks.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.640]   And what we found out because Will Smith interviewed her and said, "What is a secret
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.240]   about yourself that no one else knows?"
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.760]   And she revealed that not only did she have two tats, but she used to have a tongue piercing
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.760]   for years.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.760]   All right.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.160]   We're going to finish a show for this.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.320]   I got to go do something.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.440]   The Discipline Investor dot com.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.400]   And by the way, this week's podcast is awesome with Harry Dent.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.400]   It really is.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.440]   And I got to tell you something.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.200]   If you need help, I am here with these markets.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.200]   I'll give you the right way.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.200]   We need help.
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.200]   We need help, Andrew.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.080]   His book is The Discipline Investor Essential Strategies for Success, also on Audible dot
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.080]   com.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.600]   And of course, as usual, Jason Calicannis has absolutely nothing to promote, but do remember
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.520]   Jason's Tesla will be arriving any day now.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.360]   Are you going to do anything special and unboxing?
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.200]   Maybe I should have you come down and we could do like a show about it.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:47.840]   I will do a live tweet from the Tesla unboxing.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.400]   Does it come in a box?
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]   I don't know.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.200]   But you know, actually that would be funny if we did a 24-hour Tesla thing.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.200]   I'll do that.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.240]   That would be, nobody's done that.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.120]   I think it would get 10,000 people watching it.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.120]   I think you're right.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.280]   24 hours of Tesla.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.280]   What would we do?
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.440]   I don't, like you take it for a drive and be on quick and then stream the quick to the
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.440]   live stream.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.440]   Okay.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:14.760]   We could, or we could take it to a driving course or we could, um, because some, but
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:17.920]   we could actually start taking it apart a little bit, you know, open it up and have the
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:19.560]   Hackaday guys start looking at stuff.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.560]   That'd be fun.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:21.560]   What are they going to do?
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:22.560]   They're going to hack it?
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.560]   Well, yeah.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:28.040]   So the two hacks, one is going to be put a solar panel over the entire car.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:31.640]   So it never has to be plugged in if I'm driving less than x miles per day.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640]   Oh, that's good.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640]   The second thing I want to do.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.400]   You wouldn't drive around with the solar panel though.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.400]   No, no, no, no.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.880]   I dare is when you park, you take it out and you just roll it like a blanket over the entire
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.880]   car.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.640]   So they make these flexible solar cells now.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.800]   I live in Southern California.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.720]   So if I just drape it over the whole car, you know, who knows how much that can do, but
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.000]   people power their laptops that way, right or something.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.960]   So, um, and then we're also thinking about taking on one of those little windmills and
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:54.960]   putting that up.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.960]   So like you would raise it like a flag off the back.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.320]   And so when it's parked, the wind thing would be charging the batteries.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.560]   Who knows if it, it'll work.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:06.160]   Plus it helps you find your car when it's parked in a mall, like with those elderly people
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.520]   to the softballs on top of their, like the tech crunch 50.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.280]   Sometimes I do things to make a point, you know, like tech crunch 50 was to make a point
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.880]   like you should charge people to be on stage and I'm getting this to make a point like
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.880]   we can, we can all get off these things.
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.440]   Basically, he's kind of a modern day Amish person.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]   Amish.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:25.440]   I mean, with a car that it's not very expensive.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.360]   That car is it.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360]   Let's put it this way.
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.360]   He's buying to, he's buying to.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:34.160]   He's buying to the porty so that one can charge while the other one he's driving around.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.160]   So he'll never be without.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.160]   But you should be proud that you're not, you're not, you know, you're, you're helping
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.760]   the, the energy consumption.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:43.960]   I'm sizing down cost of the next ones.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.520]   That's how that's the spin.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.600]   And you know, and is it, is it, is it imminent?
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.160]   Are you going to get it soon?
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.160]   It's literally going to be in the next two weeks.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.880]   Oh, it's, and it's orange.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:53.880]   It's looks gorgeous.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.640]   You've got the battery already, right?
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:01.040]   Well, what I got was you have to put in a 220 volt plug into your house because if you
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.840]   plug in through a normal plug, it's like 30, 40 hours to charge.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:10.240]   If you get the 220 volt, you can either be, depending on the amperage you put in your
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:11.920]   house, three and a half to seven hours.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.920]   Oh, that's not bad.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:13.920]   That's not bad.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:14.920]   You know, I just decide something.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.920]   I have to go party with you.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.200]   I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm kidding.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.840]   I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to come out.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.840]   I'm going to win.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:21.840]   I'm just thinking, I'm going to win.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.840]   Cigars now.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.840]   Cigars?
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.920]   So cigars, poker, Tesla and lemon drops right at my, at the Tesla, I'm not a car guy, but
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.760]   the poker, the cigars, I am.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.760]   I'm going to drop.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.200]   We're kind of, we were maybe we're brothers in a different life or something.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.200]   You're doing.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.760]   Any, either you got is even Jeff.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.480]   I don't even know who this guy is, but any of you guys come out to Brentwood, any, any
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.560]   of the twit listening audience comes to Brentwood and LA.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.560]   Good.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.840]   You just come to the pool house party at my house.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.000]   Jacuzzi fits 12.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000]   Bring a bathing suit.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000]   I'm not.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000]   Please.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]   Whatever.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000]   Los Angeles.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.600]   We should actually do, you, you, you played poker Leo.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.960]   I do, but you, you, I'm, I'm the fish at the table.
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.960]   I would be.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:04.960]   None of it though.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:05.960]   We should show.
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:06.960]   Okay.
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.960]   We like that.
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:08.960]   We'll help you.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:09.960]   Of course you'll like that.
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:11.960]   I need to have a celebrity, internet celebrity poker tournament for channel.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.760]   You know, one of my dreams, I always thought, and I set up this studio just for this, I always
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.760]   thought I would have basically a twit poker game where we talk tech and play poker and
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.560]   you'd have a camera for everybody.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.840]   You do the thing like they do on world poker tour where you, you know, you show your whole
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:28.440]   cards and, and it's just the same conversation we're having right now, but we're smoking cigars
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   and playing poker and somehow we do it.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:34.360]   Instead of a regular cards, we don't have iPhones and somehow we'd have like a virtual
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.360]   dealer with the iPhone.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360]   That is so genius.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.560]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.120]   I think your pool house is the place to do it.
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:41.120]   I'll bring the cameras.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.440]   I got a studio at Mahalo.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.440]   You don't need that.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440]   You got everything.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.600]   So the only thing you don't have in my hollow is you don't have an investment segment.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.600]   That's what you should have.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:54.340]   Let me get to 10 million, you know, when you get to 10 million uniques, then you can start
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:55.640]   bolting stuff on right now.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:58.840]   I'm just like telling everybody like, I know we have some early success.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:02.160]   Can everybody please be focused on 10 million laser focus.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160]   I'm a laser.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.080]   I'm calling it.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:07.360]   I'm calling it the March to 10 million.
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:09.800]   The Alan Parsons site.
