[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Is that right, John? Did I say that right?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Perfect. John C. de Vorac is here. He is our keeper of the cultural flame, the historian of old media.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yes. You know, I have a Kai reel to reel that records and plays 8 tracks.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'd love that.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it plays, it records them.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I still need for my radio corner because I have the old AM transmitter, the old AM board.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I need turntables with felt so you can queue them up records.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, the thorns.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And I need some AMPEX real to reel, something like that.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And then I'll be happy.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Maybe I'll do a deal with it.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Also joining us, Mark Millian, who used to be with the LA Times and used to be with CNN.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But now is with Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You say Bloomberg Business Week? You say all of it being asked to me?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It's all together.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And actually, you know what, I really like Business Week. I read it all the time.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I think it's a really good source.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, good.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Glad to see you there.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And you're covering online.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Consumer technology?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Consumer tech.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We've got the experts in Consumer Tech here because also joining us, Joanna Stern from ABC News.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Joanna used to be at the Verge.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Hello, everyone.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Hi, Joanna.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I wish I was at Blumbler Business Week.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   No, don't say that.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You just want to say, "Blumbler."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah, I want to learn how to say it that way.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I'm sorry, you're on Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You're my gimme me, gimme me, gimme me.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Is that your Joel Lieberman?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He does sound like Drippy Dog, doesn't he?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   He looks like Drippy Dog.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So, it's very rare that, you know, we schedule a tweet on Sunday afternoon because we figure
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   all the news will be in by Friday.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Give you time to look at it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We won't have anything new happen.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So, it's very rare for a big story to break on a Sunday morning, but it did, in fact,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I wish you're broken on all things D, and it's now been confirmed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Scott Thompson's out at Yahoo!
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is the upshot, I guess, although they're saying, "I haven't read the official press
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   release," but they're saying, "I thought they were going to say, 'He's out because of an
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   illness.'"
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   My illness.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You know, whose illness?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I think the board is sick of him.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's a problem.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   This was what we were talking about last week, John, and I can't remember what your position
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   on was.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Brian was saying, was serious, and you were saying big deal, he doesn't have a computer
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   science degree.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   No, no, that's not, no, I'm the one who said that you can't take a chance.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I said two things.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   One is that this guy obviously knew this was on there because no CEO does not have the
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   ego where they're not constantly checking their bio and doing vanity searches and seeing
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   how they're doing.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.480]   So, he knew that was there, and then the second thing was that I believe that if you find a
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.000]   fault like this, you might be dealing with a pathological liar and you cannot take a
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   chance because those guys are extremely dangerous.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I was about to say the same thing.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That's a sickness.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah, there's something wrong.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And it's a problem.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   He didn't come clean right away either.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.800]   I mean, he just kind of let it float out there.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.000]   The first statements that Yahoo put out about it were just nonsense.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   They were, you know, it seemed like they were going to blame it on some rogue in their, like
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.200]   an intern or something.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   But I mean, we found it for a while on PayPal.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   We're getting the same.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's been going back, you know, many, many years.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.200]   And then he apologized because it took focus away.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.120]   He didn't apologize for the error.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.840]   He apologized that the employees were getting distracted.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.200]   I'm sorry you're getting distracted.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.800]   Yeah, he sent the memo to employees saying, yeah, just keep your head in the game.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.200]   The media is trying to take us down.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   Whatever it's easy.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   It was Schwood that said it wasn't important.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   It was Schwood.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   It was the other way around.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   You were, you were, and you were.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   As far as I was concerned, he was done.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   Proven correct.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.640]   Although I have to say this really feels more like a victory of the activist shareholder
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   than anything else.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.600]   It comes because this fellow, Daniel Loeb.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.360]   Yeah, he didn't like this guy at all.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   Really?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.840]   Well, he's not liked what's going on at Yahoo for a while and you can't really blame him.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   Right.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.400]   Because the stock has been dead money and this guy's got a lot of it.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.760]   So he now was the one who said, you got to get rid of Thompson.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.000]   He's won.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.160]   And in fact, he gets three board seats.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.520]   He had proposed as part of a proxy fight.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.000]   He had proposed three new board seats.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.080]   One of his selections, Jeff Sucker, actually he proposed four.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.240]   One of them, Jeff Sucker from NBC, former NBC, had will not take that seat.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.000]   But media executive Michael Wolf and turnaround specialist Harry Wilson will join the board.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.440]   The interesting thing to me is that Thompson, he was part of this big restructuring, fired
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.880]   with a couple of thousand Yahoo employees and was really refocusing Yahoo to be more less
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.240]   about a media content company and more about commerce and data.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.880]   And now you got the new CEO as a media guy again.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.080]   So we're whips, I think we're going to be whipsawed again.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.640]   Back to Terry Semmel.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.400]   It's going to be like Terry Semmel all over again.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.760]   The global media had Ross Levinson, who did run advertising sales, but is considered
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.240]   a media guy will now be the CEO at Yahoo.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.000]   I think this is just more of a mess.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.280]   I wrote a column suggesting they track down and force Steve Case to take the job.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   The guy started a well.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.480]   I think he's interested.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   Apparently not.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.440]   But my comment was he's just spending all his time at cocktail parties and Steve Case
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.320]   was a guy I put the jobs bill through.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   You know that the jobs bill.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   The job is building.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   Yeah, the jobs.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.760]   It's got that scam clause in there that now you don't have to you can fake your books
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.200]   for two or three years before you have to come clean.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.360]   This is ironic from coming from you because for years you were saying that Sarbanes Oxley,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.600]   the law that was passed after the what was it was it the the World Come or Enron Enron
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.480]   and after Enron saying you know all these disclosure requirements of publicly held companies
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.120]   and you said this was putting a lid on innovation.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.080]   Yeah, that was why nobody was going public anymore.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.320]   Repeal socks.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.520]   Yeah, yeah, I still say that.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.200]   But isn't this a step in the right direction?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.360]   It's it's it's not really because this is kind of a wink wink nudge nudge kind of a law
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.160]   or whatever they want to do, which is kind of like I don't know it's like we'll turn
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.320]   our backs on any missed misdeeds for a short time and I don't like the way that I just
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.720]   think we should roll back some of these things we've changed.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.920]   I mean, we should put Glass Teagle back in play and repeal Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.760]   The things were working fine before they started mucking around.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.200]   Yeah, they were working fine.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   They were.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.800]   From you don't remember the financial crises of the 2000s.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   The 2000 crises that they repealed Sarbanes are they repealed us.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.640]   Glass teagle during the cause of that.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.920]   Oh, no, it wasn't because that it was during that.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.720]   I mean, yeah, it was because of that that that we had to.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   Right.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.880]   No, I agree with you on that.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.280]   And there's also a bunch of other crazy laws they passed.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.680]   They changed the bankruptcy law.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.240]   So if you go bankrupt on your credit card, you're they still to pay them.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   That sucks.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   That kind of thing.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.600]   And that we have the student loan scam going on wherever your students in debt to a tune
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   of $120,000.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.160]   But Pebble Ewatch has raised $10 million on Kickstarter.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.320]   And they don't eat the jobs act for that.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.360]   Well, that's the interesting thing because they're not asking for investors to just
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.640]   saying you're buying a watch.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.640]   They sold all the watches.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   I bought them all.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   How many did you get, Joanna?
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   I bought one.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   I bought one too.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:56.880]   But I bought I spent a little extra to get multi-color so I could choose my color.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.600]   If you scroll down, you'll actually see that there are some some who use Kickstarter to
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   buy and bulk.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   I guess retailers.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.400]   Yeah, they had they had a surprisingly large number.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   If you get to the $1,000 and $10,000.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.720]   $10,000 or more.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.320]   31 people bought 100 pebbles.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   $10,000 worth.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.240]   I have a feeling that's going to be smart in this case.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.440]   I mean, I'm sure they'll ramp up production again.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.280]   But I think once this hits, I mean, we'll see actually how the watch actually does.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.040]   And I bet my video just dropped.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.000]   But we'll see how the watch actually does, like how it actually works.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.840]   But I bet these things are going to be very hard to come by.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.640]   What kind of camera do you have on that computer, Joanna?
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.520]   I have I'm just using the MacBook HD, the FaceTime HD cam.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.840]   Because sometimes when you have the Logitech for some reason, some of the Logitech cameras,
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   when the bandwidth fluctuates, they go from widescreen to 4.3 and then you drop briefly.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.880]   Is that happening?
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.960]   I you're wide now.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   I don't know.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.160]   I just, Joanna, we tested this and it worked so well.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   Sure it does.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   It always does before the show.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   You test.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   That's why I test.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   Do I look really grainy?
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.880]   No, you look great.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.560]   Thank you.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.040]   You look fabulous.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.800]   You look like a television star.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.200]   You should be on the view.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.440]   I should be on the view.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.640]   I want them to do a tech thing on the view.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   When you're on ABC, what do you do?
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   No, I know Becky Worley does GMA.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.400]   So you don't do you don't do good morning America.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.880]   You know, they do they'll call me now to just fill in and give my perspective on whatever
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.360]   the tech news is.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.000]   But no, I'm not doing package pieces like Becky.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   That's what Becky does.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   No one can touch Becky.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Becky's too good.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I know.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I tried to touch you.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You're a little bit more than you do.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You're a little bit more than you do.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   You're a little bit more than you do.

[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   You're a little bit more than you do.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   You're a little bit more than you do.

[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You're a little bit more than you do.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Was that our footage that they used?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Because Becky went two years ago to cover the Google cards.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It sounds like a violation of copyright.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   For our show, Green Tech.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Remember?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   She might have done two segments, but she did a good morning America.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I think it was an exclusive in 2010.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   They better not put that on YouTube.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   It'll get pulled down.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Finally, I get to do a copyright with it.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   I get to do a copyright with it.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I get to do a copyright with it.

[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   He bought my space.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Maybe he was against it and they made him do it.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That's what it says on his resume.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I never wanted it.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   He was also at Alta Vista, CBS Sportsline and HBO.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   He's a media guy.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Is it Alta Vista?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   You've heard of them.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   That's pretty weird.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   What did you do there?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Well, maybe ad sales.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Former managing director of Fuse Capital Investment Firm focused on media companies.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   It's media.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.600]   It's back to Terry Semmel.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   Very interesting.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.240]   Well, you have the one advantage of actually maybe showing up at the office once in a while.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.400]   Did Thompson not go to the office?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   No, Semmel.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Oh, Semmel.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   Apparently Semmel's been all his life that way.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   He's been all his life that way.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   He's like, "Oh, Hollywood."
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.560]   We're going to join and keep dropping up.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   We got her back.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.560]   I apologize.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   You're back.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   You're back.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.800]   I'm also going to blame the new Skype because this new Skype is like--
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   I'm only going to use your--
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   It's horrible.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   Shouldn't have upgraded.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.840]   I really shouldn't have upgraded.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.480]   I didn't know any better and I hit the upgrade and it sounds like my computer is going to
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.120]   take off for outer space.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.480]   Oh, it's working hard.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.040]   I have to check here, but I think Skype is using half my RAM right now.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.920]   We came up with a theory today.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   Yes.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   They're going to get people to upgrade.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.960]   They're going to start to degrade Skype to the point where they're going to be--
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.200]   They're going to figure out, "What are you going to do about monetizing this thing?"
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.800]   We got to get people to upgrade to a commercial version that they pay us money.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.360]   Now they're going to limit connectivity so she won't be able to come on this show for
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.000]   more than 20 minutes at a time.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.840]   They'll just be-- you can't be on for more than 10.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   It's just hang up.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   Yeah, it'll just hang up.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.240]   Also, it'll probably make you download Windows with it also.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.080]   Well, that's probably true.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.400]   Yeah, because Microsoft owns it, right?
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.240]   Microsoft, they can't keep losing money.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.960]   Well, they can.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.760]   They did it in the Xbox.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.920]   Yeah, but they knew that there was a golden goose at the end.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920]   There's no golden goose.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   There's nothing at the end of this--
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   It's 99 dollar Xbox.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.120]   It's $15 a month, baby.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.960]   They're actually making money on that thing.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.040]   As far as I know.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.640]   I think Skype is for locking.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   You know, they can--
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   For locking?
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   For locking.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   Wow.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.560]   For locking down the road, they build a nice suite into the Windows phone and the tablets
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.000]   and the computers and the best experience for Skype is on Microsoft devices.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   There could be a strategy.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.640]   Microsoft had all the capabilities that Skype offers.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   That's the funny thing.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   They had a product that does all that.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   Yeah, and they still have links.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   What they really bought--
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   Is that Windows Live Communicator?
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   I don't know.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.640]   Some funky name.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   There's a business product as well.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.320]   But what they really got was a brand name and a customer base.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   That's what they really got, right?
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.640]   It's not about the product.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   It's not about--
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640]   Well, the technology's good too.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   I mean, it's pure to peer rather than the junk that--
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   And we can see how well it's working right now.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   Working great today.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.560]   Actually, you know, I shouldn't mock it because there would be no Twitter if it weren't for
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   Skype.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   We've always used Skype.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   This is true.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   We've had great results.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   We've tried other things constantly trying.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.560]   None of them work.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560]   None of them work as well as Skype.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   You know, I know that we're having a little bit of a difficulty.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.040]   But look, Joanna's in New York City.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.760]   She's sitting around the table with us.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   The picture's great.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   The sounds are great.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   I mean, I'm not going to complain.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   I love technology.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   It doesn't work all the time, but that's fine.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   You know, actually, I got my start in tech-- the tech profession representing Skype.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   I was--
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   No.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   I worked for their PR agency.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   Really?
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.600]   Yeah, I worked for their PR agency for about five months.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.160]   And I was reading all this tech press.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.920]   I was reading GIGO, and I was reading TechCrunch.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.240]   I was reading everything because I was monitoring for Skype.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   And he said, "I could do that."
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.800]   I really like what those guys are doing.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.160]   So I went and got a job.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.400]   So I should thank Skype for my success.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   Thank you, Skype.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.160]   Wow, that's a huge way.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.160]   Interest.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.080]   One last thing, and then we're going to move on.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:57.780]   I think the kiss of death, perhaps, for Scott Thompson, was he blamed the headhunting
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:04.900]   firm that hired him, you know, got him the job at Yahoo for changing his resume.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.900]   And the headhunting firm--
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.900]   What?
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.380]   The headhunting firm was so upset.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.540]   They put an internal memo saying he's full of it, and we can prove it.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.540]   Yeah, he had the same resume at PayPal.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.540]   Like, what?
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.700]   Yeah, he did.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.780]   They were so upset that he blamed Hedrick.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.780]   It's called "Heldrick."
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.940]   Well, now there's your pathological liar phenomenon, as I say.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.320]   Yeah, I think that might be what they finally-- there is going to be an investigation,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.140]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.160]   Would you use a headhunting firm called "Heldrick and Struggles?"
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.040]   It sounds more like some sort of an S&M club.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   Headlock and Struggles.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.960]   Can't forget that.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   We're going to take a break.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   Come back with more.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.760]   Joanna Stern is here from ABC, not the Australian Broadcasting Company.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.960]   No, no, no.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   The Murr.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.760]   Am I less crooked right now?
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.560]   No, but you're left.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.560]   You're left.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560]   You're left.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.640]   For ABC, we don't know for sure.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   She's less crooked.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.400]   No, because everyone was complaining in the chat room about how I'm crooked, and me and
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.640]   Alene noticed it before.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.720]   And so now I move my laptop up a little bit.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   No, it's not.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   Your lamp is falling over.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.920]   Joanna, look over your left shoulder.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   No, it's not.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   It's actually really not.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.160]   Oh, then your-- my apartment is on a slant.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.760]   What did they pay you at ABC?
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   No, no.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   She lives back east.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   I swear, a very nice apartment.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.560]   I think my desk or something is on a slant.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   It could be.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   So by the way--
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   --slide zone.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   Given that Thompson seems to have some trouble with the truth--
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.960]   I'm just going to hold this here.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.360]   --fell had a good suggestion in our chat room.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.760]   Yahoo should get John Lovitz to be their next guest.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.960]   Yeah, we're going to go in an immediate.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   That's it.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   Yeah, media.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   That's the ticket.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   That's the ticket.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   We're going to take a break.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.360]   Come back with more with Joanna from ABC with Mark Millian of Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.560]   Do you say Bloomberg Business Week or just Bloomberg?
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.960]   I work for Bloomberg and write for Business Week sometimes.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.960]   So I'm going to say Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   And JohnSeedevorac.org/blog.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   Yeah, that's one.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   Channeldevorac.com.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   That's one.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.560]   They're all disappointed in the chat room that you did not wear the Beach Boys shirt,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.560]   but you're now wearing a lumberjack shirt.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.960]   I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.360]   Yeah, every time you come, you should come as a different person.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.360]   Yeah, I guess you'll get my--
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   Fireman next time.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   Yeah, it could be like the Village People with a deck journalist.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   That's all in one.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.440]   That's what I need.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.160]   You could get the cover of Newsweek.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.960]   So we're going to take a break, come back and talk right now though about-- in a bit,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.880]   we're going to talk about the Facebook IPO because I think this is good.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.480]   And Mark is upset because of the hoodie incident.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.520]   So we'll talk about the hoodie incident hoodie.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.360]   But I want to tell you about Stamps.com, why go to the post office, which can be a mixed
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   bag, frankly.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.680]   Let's admit it, parking and there's a line.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.880]   You go at lunch, everybody else went at lunch.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   But you got to have stamps.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.480]   No, you got to use Stamps.com.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.200]   This is the modern way of getting postage.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.800]   You print it yourself.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.960]   It's not counterfeiting.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   It's legal.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.280]   It's official US postage from your computer, your printer.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.400]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.640]   You don't need special ink.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.520]   You just need stamps.com.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.080]   And it looks much more professional.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.240]   You can actually have your company logo and information on the stamp.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   They fill out the forms.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.480]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, you're going to love this.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.240]   The software on Amazon and eBay talks to the software at Stamps.com.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.360]   And all the forms are filled out.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.480]   The exact right postage because you got that USB scale they provide.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   It's just fantastic.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.560]   We've got a special deal for you.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.120]   Normally it's $80.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.400]   See that special offer?
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.720]   No, click the microphone there.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.920]   And use the offer code TWIT, TWIT.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:48.040]   And we're going to give you $55 a free postage to take that offer up to $110.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.200]   You get a scale.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.640]   You only place shipping and handling for that.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.360]   You get a $55 worth of postage coupons.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.120]   You get a course a four-week trial.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.040]   And the equipment and all that stuff to print your own postage equipment.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   There's no equipment.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.480]   You just need a little software.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.560]   That's it.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.640]   Stamps.com use the offer code TWIT.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   It says $55 offer right there.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.320]   But that's actually twice that.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.680]   It's $110 offer.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.640]   Use the offer code TWIT at Stamps.com.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.920]   I love it for international mail, too.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.280]   I used to have to go to the post office.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.440]   You want to mail anything to Australia.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.040]   You have to get an international postage order or whatever they call it.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   It'll do it.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.800]   And it fills out the forms and everything for you.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   And then the mailman comes again.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.040]   Or the mail carrier comes again.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.440]   Stamps.com.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.200]   Try it right now.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.400]   You'll love it.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.240]   So Friday, right?
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   Friday Mark Zuckerberg becomes a billionaire.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.640]   If it goes off at the price people are saying Facebook's asking, he'll become a $14 billion
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   air.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   That's nice.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   That's good work.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   That's a lot of money.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   That's a lot of money.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.280]   Well, you have to manage that money.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.360]   It was on Bloomberg TV, wasn't it?
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.520]   That an analyst came on.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.680]   Mark's been doing the road show for the IPO.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.400]   And sometimes he shows up.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   Sometimes he doesn't.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   Sometimes he's on video.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   Sometimes he's not.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.760]   Sometimes he's wearing a hoodie.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   And what's wrong with that?
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.920]   Michael Packter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, goes on Bloomberg TV and says, "Mark and his
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.960]   signature hoodie, he's actually showing investors he doesn't care that much.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.360]   He's going to be him.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.080]   But I think that's a mark of immaturity.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.160]   I think he has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.880]   And this is where he goes deadly wrong.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:36.040]   I think he has to show them the respect they deserve because he's asking for their money.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   Is that true?
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   Do you need to come when you're--
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.600]   I actually wrote a call on PCMag.com about this specific thing, especially that guy's
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   comment.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   No.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.240]   These people are begging him to take the stock.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   Well, that's the debate.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.320]   He's not asking them for anything.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.120]   That's the interesting debate because there was an article actually.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.720]   They should be kissing his ass.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   That's what I think.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.560]   And he could wear whatever he wants.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.000]   And that's obviously what he thinks.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Well, he doesn't care.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   He doesn't-- I don't think he-- you know, they were--
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.160]   I'm sure he doesn't care.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.960]   I believe they were forced into this by SEC regulations.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.280]   I don't think they wanted to go public.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   They didn't really have to.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.080]   I mean, they could have just filed the necessary documents and stayed--
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   Well, I thought if you had 500--
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   I think it's a private company.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.400]   I thought if you had five-- once you gave out 500 people--
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.200]   Then you have to start filing to the SEC.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.560]   You don't have to do an IPO and--
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   Oh, but if you're--
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.560]   --public money.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   But if you're going to--
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   That's thinking.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.880]   --do all this disclosure stuff, you might as well get some money while you're at it.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.880]   That's the thinking.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880]   Right.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.400]   Tech Crunch-- actually, I'm sorry, Michael Arrington and Uncrunched because he's an unpaid blogger
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.280]   now-- actually has a fascinating article.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.720]   I'd love to know what you think about this because the Bloomberg story said that the Facebook
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.400]   IPO was going to get weaker than forecast demand.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.680]   Bloomberg had name sources and said, you know, people don't-- I really have that inside it
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.360]   about the Facebook IPO.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:08.240]   According to Mike-- and I believe him on this-- Facebook PR went into high gear.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   They found--
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   They have PR.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:19.200]   --to the writers and fed them a story that said, oh no, the IPO is already oversubscribed.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.920]   And as Mike points out, all the sources were unnamed close to the--
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.280]   I think it was only one source that Reuters used.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.600]   It was one anonymous source.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.880]   That was the last I checked.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   Maybe they've dealt up with it.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.840]   They said, according to our source, close to the story-- in other words, a Facebook PR
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.280]   specialist, right?
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   Speculation.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.680]   I don't really know who their source was.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.400]   It was interesting that they published about an hour after we did.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   Literally exactly.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.600]   Looking on the story for a while.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.680]   They said, oh, we have a story too.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.040]   So what is the prediction?
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   Somebody called us.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   So what is the truth?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   You got--
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   What is the prediction?
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.960]   Well, so we reported-- we had about five reporters working on this and source-- mostly
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.800]   anonymously, I think-- that the Facebook IPO, as of-- I think it was Wednesday when we
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.360]   did this or Thursday-- was getting weaker than forecasted demand.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.160]   So they were expecting a certain demand from institutional investors.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.520]   And what they were seeing after the first week was less than they.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.880]   Now, these two stories could both be true.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   They could, yeah.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880]   Because what they--
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.120]   Could be oversubscribed, but they could have expected maybe that it would be much more
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   a higher price--
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.760]   Or at a higher price, for instance.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.040]   Because what would be-- they haven't priced it yet.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.280]   They have until May 17th to price it.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.360]   So what the response to lackluster interest would be as well, we won't make it 48 bucks.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.920]   Now, what do you say?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.680]   And so that could be what's going on, right?
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   Could be.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   I don't know.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.320]   What is the price expected to be?
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   Who have any ideas?
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   They're going to be $50.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   Let me see if they--
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.000]   Typically, if you want to run up to stock price in some IPO like this, you never really
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.160]   price it more than $15 million.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:07.240]   So Facebook is offering $337.4 million shares at somewhere between $20 million.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.080]   $28 and $35 million.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.640]   It'll be NASDAQ, the stock symbol, FB.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   They have to the--
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:19.160]   To March 17th-- or sorry, May 17th to actually decide on what the price will be.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:25.240]   In other words, right before-- because the IPO is Friday, the 18th, right?
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.920]   I'll be surprised if this thing doesn't go over big.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   Let's find out.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.680]   So I will predicate this with-- I'm sure that none of us are allowed or interested in buying
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.720]   tech stocks because that would be a conflict of interest.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   Correct.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.360]   And probably some of us are lousy advisors.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.000]   I would include myself.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.560]   If you listen to me for stock advice, you're nuts.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.280]   But let's start with Joanna.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.560]   Facebook stock.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   Are you going to grab it?
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   Is it going to go up?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   Is it going to go down?
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.560]   What do you think?
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.960]   Like you said, I can invest in it.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.440]   But I think it'll-- it's hard to say.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.600]   And what we're hearing about some certain Facebook products, I think it'll go up.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.040]   I think the more they put into some of their products and the more they're going to focus
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.720]   on mobile and all of that, probably better success of it going up, better chance of it
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   going up.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   You give it a buy rating, Mark Millian?
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.160]   I don't really know about that.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.960]   I mean, there's a pretty significant divide between the private and the public investment
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.720]   sectors right now.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.440]   Facebook has sold shares-- well, not itself.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.680]   And on the secondary market shares have gone at a $105 billion valuation before.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.800]   Which is considerably more than they're asking.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   Right.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.360]   They're looking for a $90 to $100 billion value.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:50.280]   And if you look at the VC market here in the Valley, and if you look at Facebook's own
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.160]   purchase, a billion dollars for Instagram, a lot of people think is crazy for a company
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.720]   that makes no money.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.720]   Phew.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   Instagram, not Facebook.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   Facebook makes--
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   Instagram.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:12.520]   But you look at LinkedIn and Groupon and Yelp and Pandora, all of these big tech IPOs, they
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.920]   have a first day pop and then they're not looking for any--
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.800]   It's Groupon's in a single digits.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.560]   There's no bubble in the public sector.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   So you mean once you issue these stocks, once you get into the real value--
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.720]   Once you get evaluated, yeah, on the grander market when you're playing in the same boat
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.920]   as Walmart and Exxon and these other giants, the game is a little bit--
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.360]   That's what these investors are saying, these big institutional investors are saying,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.880]   "Based on the fundamentals, we look at fundamentals.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.000]   We look at how the company's doing, what its prospects are, how its businesses run.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.160]   Based on the fundamentals, we don't think it's worth what they're asking is what they're
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.960]   saying, at least according to this story.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.560]   Bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.560]   weak."
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.400]   Yeah, that's going to be the new thing.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   You laugh, but it's memorable.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   I like that.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.760]   Well, you do our commercials.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.720]   If you put a breastfeeding mother on the cover--
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720]   No, you're talking.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   Warren Buffett breastfeeding, Exxon Valdez.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   Bill Gates.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.600]   You could have Bill Gates standing on a chair.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.720]   Oh, that's a great cover for the--
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   In Camo.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   In Camo.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.240]   John C. de Vorac, are you long or short on Facebook?
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.160]   Well, I think what's being overlooked here is that there's a weird public offering phenomenon
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.640]   that takes place with companies that the public actually uses and loves.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.640]   That means the public--
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.600]   In other words, McDonald's stocked as well, because everybody who knows nothing about
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.800]   investing says, "Well, I eat burgers, so I'm going to buy McDonald's stock."
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   That's true.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   That's true.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.080]   There's enough people out there that think-- and they've heard the buzz.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.320]   Facebook, Facebook, Facebook.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.640]   And they got Zuckerberg on the cover of this and that and the other thing.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.160]   The public, in this case, yeah, the professional investors are smart enough to know that this
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.520]   is probably a short-term turkey.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.640]   But the public sees it as an opportunity to get into something that they love.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.920]   I think this thing is going to-- I mean, I'm not saying it's going to go up forever, but
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.360]   I think it's going to be just one of the strongest performers and it will probably trigger a
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.160]   whole bunch of really sketchy IPOs.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.440]   They're asking for 24 times their revenue to give you a benchmark.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.640]   Google's stock is at five times revenue right now.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   They're asking for four times--
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   The investing five times more.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   --the investing five times more.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   --because it's not going to pay any attention to these kinds of things.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   They don't care.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   All right.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.120]   Well, I'm going to give you the right answer.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:27.720]   I am long on Facebook because Facebook has just begun to scratch its monetization itch.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.960]   So you can't look at the current fundamentals.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.240]   They're very carefully-- I think they've done the-- hey, I watched the social network.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.760]   I know what's going on.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.760]   I know.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.120]   I'm inside the-- you saw it twice.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.880]   You knew what Eduardo was going to do, right?
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   What?
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.560]   He was going to put cheese hands on there.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.880]   He was going to-- yeah, he was going to change his-- he's not a citizen.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.400]   You know, actually, Eduardo is going to make a bank on this, too.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   He's going to be worth several billions.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   And he won't be paying the same taxes that a lot of people--
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   Yes.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   --you knew-- Leo knew.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.320]   Leo knew all along.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.240]   I'm just saying-- I'm just saying that Mark, I watched that movie.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.120]   And look at that.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.880]   Is that for tax reasons he's doing that?
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   Well, he didn't say--
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.280]   What a little weasel.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   That is weasily.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.720]   That's a wussy moving Singapore, right?
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   God bless America.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.120]   He's lived there for a while, actually.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   Sucker Brooks was--
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   He read about this guy.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.600]   This guy's a weasel.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.240]   He's going to Singapore to tax haven to--
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   Just--
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.600]   You know, there's still the possibility-- this IPO won't come off, you know.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.800]   They might actually just pull the plug.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   It could happen.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   There's all kinds of possibilities.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.400]   So this crazy thing that just happened with JP Morgan is a--
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.880]   They might just pull the plug.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   They won't pull the plug.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.480]   Yeah, they lost a couple billion.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   I think it's pretty unlikely.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.480]   If there were some cat-a-drop--
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   We'll see.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   --it's a possibility.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   --with the possibility if the market crashed completely and they pulled the plug, if we
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.240]   had a massive market meltdown, they pulled the plug.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.520]   You know, I was doing the radio show about 15 years ago.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.840]   We were doing a remote broadcast.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.640]   Guy pulls up in a Rolls Royce.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.760]   And he says to me, he says, "Leo, you bought me that Rolls Royce."
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   I said, "I did.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   How did I buy you that Rolls Royce?"
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.320]   He said, "Leo, you were talking about zip drives and how great zip disks were."
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.760]   And I said, "I got to invest in that I-O-MEGA company."
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.640]   You see that Rolls Royce?
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   It's going to be repossessed tomorrow because it's not that bad.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   No, but--
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:27.520]   --the rewrite of the joke where I went to Las Vegas in a $40,000 car and came home in $150,000
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   bus.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   OK.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.520]   Or the famous Richard Branson quote, "You want to become a millionaire?
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.680]   Start as a billionaire and buy an airline."
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.360]   It's a tough crowd tonight.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.280]   In the Twitter broadcast, it's a tough crowd.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   They're not booing us.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   That's true.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   They could be throwing--
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.920]   Lots of people laughing at my crooked apartment.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   You've got to know.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   Look at these dimes.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   She's really arranged the--
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   It was a crooked girl who had a crooked smile.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.560]   No, it looks good.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   Everything's straight.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   Yeah, because I moved the lamp.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   Yeah, no time for president Obama.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.640]   Oh, no.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640]   No.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.640]   No.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.280]   My computer is totally crooked.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.240]   Like I'm propping it up with a note-- a thing of notepads.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.640]   I mean, another mouse is under it.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.200]   You'll be hanging upside down before the end of the show.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   I got to explain the Obama crack because people are going to get mad at me.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.680]   They're both news weekend time, and this has nothing to do with text.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   I'm going to do it really quickly.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.360]   News weekend time we're in some sort of weird circulation war.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:33.640]   Newsweek for Mother's Day puts a mom breastfeeding her son, who's four, and he's standing on
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   a chair.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.640]   That was six.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   Six, whatever.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   He's big.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   It's kind of creepy.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   It's kind of creepy.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.520]   It's kind of creepy, yes.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.320]   The other thing is she's an out of work actor.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   She's kind of hot.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.320]   So it's a little--
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   So you're trying to-- you're thinking, well, it could be me.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.520]   No, I think that's part of the problem.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.240]   Yeah, I'm thinking that could be me on that chair in the camo pants.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:00.080]   And then, and then, Newsweek puts a picture of Obama with a rainbow halo over his head,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:06.760]   says-- it hasn't come out yet, but we're told by Bloomberg Business Week that he's going
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.880]   to say the headline is going to be Obama is Obama's America's first gay president because
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.400]   of his stance on gay marriage.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.920]   We have the cover at ABC News.com.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   So it's true.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920]   It's a look.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   I bet you that gets pulled.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.800]   We never get to buy a copy.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   Prediction number two.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.280]   Boy, you're on a roll.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.640]   So Facebook, IPO, they're going to pull the plug.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.000]   No, I said it's possible.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.640]   I'm not predicting that.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.160]   I'm just saying if it happened, it wouldn't surprise me.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.800]   ABC.com is--
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Yeah, ABC News.com.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.560]   Oh, ABC News.com, because I'm seeing--
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.560]   I don't even forbid.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.120]   I'm seeing Duet's, the series premiere Thursday, May 24th on ABC.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.280]   ABCNews.com.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.920]   Just want to point out that Business Week's not playing that sleazy game.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   No, I like this.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   We're doing oil.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.920]   There's a big oil.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   In fact, that cover--
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.040]   It's just, instead, they do the worst cover that no one will ever buy from a newsstand
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:02.720]   yellow on-- without even any border around it, just yellow and pink and green and brown.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.360]   Yeah, and a bunch of other--
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   And then it says--
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   And then it says--
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   And we think for the New Yorker cover.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.120]   It's a good feature on Apple in here.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   It's not even a--
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   It's not even a stranglehold over Hollywood.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.120]   Oh, that's good.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   I like that.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.120]   I like that.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   I like that.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   Oh, I heard that the other day.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   That was a great piece.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   And then you're right.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   This isn't exactly in the same league.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.920]   This Brazil's big war on big oil.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.720]   And then it's a guy-- looks like a samba, one of those carnival dancers.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   And he's spattered.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.960]   He's kind of all messy with oil.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.280]   If that's what it is.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   I didn't even know--
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   It's a woman, right?
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   Or is it a woman?
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   I love the New Yorker.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   The New Yorker cover takes the--
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   What's the New Yorker?
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   It's the cover this week.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   Oh, it's also--
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.120]   It's the White House with rainbow columns.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   That's a little more subtle.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.880]   It's actually I think that's great.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.880]   That's a little more subtle.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.800]   You know, this is a new feature on Twitter.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   Anything subtle about this.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   There's like--
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   New's analysis.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   New's analysis.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.680]   Didn't they used to do that?
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   I mean, where they go.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   The Sky TV has all these different covers of all the news panel.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   Oh, yeah, I've seen that.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.160]   And like CNN, I think that old guy, Jack, used to do that.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   He holds up different--
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   The only exercise he got.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.880]   I think it's like this morning in the papers or whatever.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.480]   Jack's probably my age, right?
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.920]   So yeah, the morning papers.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   So I'm just looking for--
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.920]   Sunday afternoon.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   Yeah, the morning.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.320]   Another exciting episode of Twitch.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   Jase Louise.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.920]   Anything more-- let me just see if there's anything more we want to say about Facebook.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:33.560]   Well, you were talking about their monetization and they just turned two potential new revenue
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.920]   streams on just last week.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   Like the app store?
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   Yeah, the app store.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.920]   They're going to start selling--
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.920]   Yeah, eight apps.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.920]   That's bizarre.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   Facebook.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.920]   Except they're not.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   This is what's a little strange about it.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   What do you get to sell?
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.680]   Well, if Zinga wants to sell a version of words with friends, they can put it up for
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.480]   a dollar or two dollars.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   Facebook will take 30--
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   And takes 20%.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   Let me see if I can.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.200]   And Zinga's been using Facebook credit for a while, but now they're welcoming more developers.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.520]   So what's interesting is they're selling apps for-- they're not selling.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.360]   They're showing apps for iPhone, Android phone.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   Look at it.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.200]   That's the big Apple app store logo.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.600]   Wait a minute, this can't be it.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   This is something--
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   That's Apple's app store.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   That's Apple's app store.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   You want app center.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.800]   App center, which-- don't laugh at me.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   Now I get a little--
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   There we go.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   That is just turned ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   Geez, Louise.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   They haven't--
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   I thought they were breaking some news there.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   So they started taking applications--
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   It's not launched.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   --subicious from developers.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   All that effort.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   He set you up.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   Well, OK.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   So I'm going to invite him back.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.720]   My point being that they will show iPhone apps and other apps.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.200]   And what will happen is when you click it, it will go right to the app store because
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   they can't sell iPhones.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   Right.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.440]   But if-- at least at first, if you're going to get an app and use it on Facebook.com,
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.920]   maybe sign up for a new account.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.240]   But apps are free on Facebook, aren't they?
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.240]   All of them are right now.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.680]   And you can buy in-app purchases through Facebook credits.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:05.400]   Now, pretty soon they're going to start letting developers sell Facebook.com applications.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.000]   Facebook says it's not competing directly with Apple or Google.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.320]   The app center will send traffic to both the iOS and Android platforms.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.360]   However, what they're going to do is they're going to highlight apps that use Facebook
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.640]   connect.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.120]   So what it really is-- this is the real reason they're doing this.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.360]   I don't think it's so much for revenue.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.760]   I think it's to encourage more and more people to use Facebook connect.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   Right?
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.680]   And that lets you-- and I actually like it.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.440]   It's a good-- consumers love it too.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   And it just makes you--
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.920]   That's definitely the strategy on the free apps.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.000]   But as Mark was saying, I mean, on the paid apps, that'll-- there'll be a different strategy,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   I'm sure.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.320]   And this could be-- you know, I have no insight into this.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:49.280]   But it could potentially be a way to sort of hack the Apple and Google payment model.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.960]   Apple has a restriction where you can't sell e-napp purchases.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.960]   Right.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.160]   And then, you know, Apple wants to-- let's say words with friends.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.800]   They go on their Facebook.com.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.280]   They pay for Facebook credits with words with friends.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.840]   And let's say you were able to log into your Facebook account on the iPhone app and it says,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.280]   oh, you've already paid for this.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   You don't need to pay again.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.320]   No, no, Apple-- no, Apple will-- what do you think Apple's idiot?
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.280]   What do you think their stamp is on does that with the Kindle?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.920]   You can download books on your computer and then the books show up in your Kindle app.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.480]   You just can't buy them through a link in the iPhone app.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   Right.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   And that's a point.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   So-- and Amazon actually had to take out links to the store from their app.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   But they still say, go to our store, buy it and it'll show up on the Kindle app.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.280]   I'm amazed Apple allows that.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.440]   Yeah, I am too.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.600]   I guess they have to with Kindle.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.760]   Will they have to with Facebook?
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.480]   There's no love loss there.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   Facebook is powerful.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   It's the biggest app on the iPhone.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.120]   If they turned on Apple, can you imagine?
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.120]   Ooh.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.680]   Stocks already gone down.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.440]   You feel like there's no love loss because Apple does incorporate Twitter heavily into
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.480]   the iPhone, but Facebook, not so much.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   And ping ping ping--
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.120]   Well, that's always been the-- you'd probably know more, but that's always been sort of
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.360]   the rumor, right, about the tension between the two companies, why the iPad app was delayed
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   so many times.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   Right.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.360]   I mean, there's--
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.040]   Remember when they demoed ping and had Facebook in it and when it was released, it did not.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   Yeah, I signed up.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.040]   I signed up through it and then it got broken.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.040]   Sign up the first day, got my Facebook.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.560]   I mean, nobody was on it at the time, but I was able to hook into my face.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   You know what?
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.560]   But he's still nobody's on it.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   Yes, nobody's on it.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:30.640]   And I think there's been some evidence that Apple has built some of the Twitter-like integration
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:36.120]   for Facebook into iOS, but they never launched it because they never reached a deal with
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   Facebook.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.840]   So there's several things that Facebook, they might get pure revenue.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.520]   They encourage people to use Facebook Connect, developers to use Facebook Connect, which puts
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.800]   people in the fakest book ecosystem.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.000]   And they may even make money on in-app credits or purchases through some sneaky little end
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.480]   to get the 30% there.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.800]   Now, you said there's two ways that they're monetizing.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   What was the other way that they announced?
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   Well, so--
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.480]   Is it paid to promote those?
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   Back to the app--
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   Oh, OK.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:10.640]   Apple has taken, you know, since 2008, our important story that Apple has gotten $1.7
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.480]   billion in revenue from the app store.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.920]   So there's an obvious business there.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.360]   And that's something investors might be excited about with Facebook launching this last week
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.720]   or talking about it last week and about the--
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.840]   That's why they do all this stuff running up to the IPO.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:36.520]   And another potential revenue stream is they're testing this ability to write a status update
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:42.320]   and then pay to have it highlighted, featured highly in your friends.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.640]   That's so annoying.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.700]   So OK, so let me get this straight.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.960]   So I do a status update and then I give Facebook a couple of bucks and they'll make sure that
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.320]   my status update is-- my friends see it.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.800]   And Twitter does that too.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   I mean, these are--
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   Yeah, but not for a couple of bucks.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   But not right.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   It's very expensive, right?
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   It's very expensive, right?
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.600]   Well, it's not as expensive as promoted trends.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   But it's not $2.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   Which is that?
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   Does anyone price that out?
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   Promoted trends.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   It's out there.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.520]   I think it's over 100k per day.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.880]   It's very expensive.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   And how about getting into somebody's tweet stream?
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   I don't know.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.600]   I think it's more like a self-service model similar to Google Ads.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.280]   Oh, so you-- is there an auction kind of a thing or?
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.640]   I'm not totally familiar with it, but I believe it works that way.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.760]   Now, the issue-- the other issue is that we just learned that for the first time ever,
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.800]   most Facebook users, more than half are now using it on mobile, not on the desktop, which
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.680]   is more difficult to monetize.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.480]   So Facebook does have to turn on things like this.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   Right.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.680]   Because this is a way to make money without an ad, a display ad.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   Right.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.880]   I mean, it looks a lot more like Twitter's advertising.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.000]   And Twitter has almost always been a mobile first company.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Twitter's got the same problem.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.800]   And they need to think about ways ad units that will translate to small screens.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.040]   And I think Facebook is starting to identify that.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:21.680]   And it's an important time for them to start testing these types of ad units because they
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.920]   had to amend their S1 last week, their public filing, to say that advertising revenue has
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.840]   not kept pace with user growth because of the movement to mobile.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   Right.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.440]   So these are the negatives in the IPO.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   Potential.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.600]   I think that it would be foolish for Facebook to rely on advertising for its revenue.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.440]   There's a lot of ways they can monetize all this information that they have about us that
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.240]   there's a lot of ways that-- I think this pay to promote is a very interesting idea.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.720]   We can expect them to try a lot of stuff.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   Look at Beacon.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.240]   They try stuff.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.720]   And Beacon was a horrible failure.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.240]   And they pulled it out and they apologized.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.120]   They paid a fine and moved on.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.520]   And I'm sure that we'll see a lot more things like that.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.240]   Some of them may go over the line as Beacon did.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.720]   I hope meanwhile they're also innovating with features and things that their 900 million
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:17.920]   users want to use rather than only in advertising.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   A couple more Facebook--
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.640]   When is F8 supposed to be this year?
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   When is it typically?
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   September.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   It's September.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.600]   That's the Facebook Developers Conference.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.240]   I don't see a date for the next F8.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   It was September last year.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.240]   Yeah, I think right typically.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.960]   It's 922 last year.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.960]   That's fun.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   That's where you'd see a lot of that.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   Right.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.000]   You remember seeing-- I think we talked about it last week.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.960]   The CEO of AT&T say, "I'm losing sleep over iMessage because Apple's taking money out
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.480]   of our SMS pockets."
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.800]   And when it thinks of Google Voice.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   Randall Stevenson.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   He said, "There's a lot of things that are disruptive to our--" he says, "iMessage is
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.200]   disruptive to our--" I love this euphemism.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.120]   "Messaging revenue stream."
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.520]   The big box we make from SMS shouldn't be making anything from it.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.520]   I agree.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.920]   And he added that Skype was becoming a more viable voice service as data networks improve
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.160]   which poses a threat as well.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.760]   But the real question is how much is-- it's not Apple's iMessage you got to worry about.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:26.640]   It's Facebook messaging which has the same exact technique, right?
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.960]   You can use-- even though it's funny there's no iPad version, there's an iPhone version.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.800]   And you can send messages to anybody.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.600]   Especially since everybody's on Facebook right now.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.560]   And especially because iMessage doesn't work all that well.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   That's what I think.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.280]   I just turned it off because they're not getting their messages.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.040]   But Facebook Messenger, or whatever it's called, works great.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:57.840]   In the Philippines, 50% drop in text messages from 660 a month average per person.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.240]   This is one of the big text messaging nations.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:06.360]   So this is kind of a bellwether to 600 from 660 to 400 year to year.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.360]   And?
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   Well, why?
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.880]   It's a data point.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.520]   I think because they're using the internet.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.760]   They're using data instead of SMS.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   Maybe not.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.640]   Maybe they don't want to talk to each other anymore.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.360]   Maybe they broke up.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.720]   I have no idea.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.240]   I never knew this.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.920]   Well, it's just a fact.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.320]   There's no analysis attached.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   It's just what it is.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.320]   Well, that's what we're here for.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   This is your job.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.120]   I don't know about anything about this.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.880]   But this isn't this group that's sitting here.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.880]   You want to hypothesize.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   We're seeing it all over the world.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.480]   We need to know what the most popular type of phone is there.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   Right.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.480]   And we can better make it.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   It's happening in other countries.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.760]   It's not so much happening in the US.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.920]   I think we're still going up.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.880]   But we were late to the party on text messaging.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.880]   True.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:57.480]   But globally, these free messaging apps, essentially versions of iMessage.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   It's me.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   It's WhatsApp.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   There's a million of them.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.920]   Samsung has this cross-platform messenger.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.320]   Just to say, BBM was here before all these.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   Blackberry messenger.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   If you go to a high school--
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.000]   And now on high Blackberry, I'm the only one with BBM and BBM because all my friends have
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   left the Blackberry.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Well, that's because they all graduated from high school.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.440]   Yes, that's true.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.800]   In high school, everybody for a long time until very recently was using Blackberries because
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.880]   they had BBM.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   And that's interesting.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   Now, Joanna, do you use text messaging?
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.200]   I mean, I use like three different phones.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.800]   So I'm constantly going between them.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.880]   So I use email actually a lot more than text messaging.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.360]   But if I'm meeting someone, I use text.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   I text.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.560]   I cannot get everybody I know to use my Google Voice number because if they use that, then
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.600]   it would text to every phone I use.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.320]   But what happens then, I text them from a phone and they get that number and then they
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.160]   respond to that phone, but they don't have that phone the next day.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.680]   Yeah, I haven't mastered Google Voice.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.960]   They also can't send you picture messages, which is kind of annoying.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.640]   That's why I stopped using Google Voice.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:09.080]   Maybe there should be something up with this with this proclamation from John.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.920]   Something's up with this crazy information.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   There's this spirit.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.560]   I think that this is why Randall Stevenson is sleeping well is that more and more people
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.760]   are turning to these group message services.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.600]   You know, Facebook bought Beluga.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   That's basically what became Facebook's messenger.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.160]   Finally, the Instagram deal.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   Interesting article.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.000]   I think it was on the verge where they talked to their ex.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Oh, no, it was from the Financial Times originally.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   I'm reading it from the Verge, where they talked to people familiar with the matter,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.760]   saying the FTC is investigating the Facebook Instagram acquisition.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   And that may hold it up.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.120]   It can take from six months to a year for Kevin's system to get his hundreds of millions of
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   dollars.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.360]   So you got to feel for Kevin.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   Poor guy.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.960]   He's just hanging in the wind waiting for his money.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.360]   It's hard to be rich, but not have access to that money.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   Take it from me.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   Right.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.480]   Meanwhile, the week Zuckerberg might have that same amount of money in his pocket, right?
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:10.720]   And it could all go away if the FTC, typically what they would do is ask for the deal to
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.600]   be restructured, maybe some sell off some assets or whatever.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:20.000]   But of course, you know why the FTC is investigating because it'll screw up the IPO.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.200]   That's why because Twitter bitched.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.600]   And said, Hey, hey, we tried to buy them.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.920]   Hey, don't let them do that.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.040]   And the and the FTC's who what?
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   Okay.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.320]   I like the way these companies are so cooperative Twitter.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.680]   Twitter was also looking at camera plus, right, at potentially purchasing them immediately
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.840]   after the Instagram deal.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.600]   Too bad that didn't happen.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.440]   Yeah, I think, you know, Lisa, Lisa would have been rich.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.920]   Yeah, she'd be buying.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   Well, they've sold.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   I think she's doing all right.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.240]   Oh, no, she's doing very, very well.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.280]   Lisa Bettany, who is one of the people who I think she's made a camera plus easily made
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.560]   over in a million years over because they've sold six million in a buck each.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.200]   And I think she has a pretty decent share of that.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.680]   So she should be buying anyway.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   No, that's what I say.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   She's never home.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   She travels all over the world.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   Well, she can't get back to the state.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   No, she got her visa.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   Oh, she did finally.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   She got her visa.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.280]   She's, but she won't show up anymore because she's hanging out with the Florida sovereign.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.280]   She's a poor with her billions.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.640]   She's cash more's girlfriend now.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   What?
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   Okay.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   Okay, let's dish a little gossip.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.480]   It's not gossip is a fact.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:35.080]   We keep hearing these rumors that Mashable CNN is going to buy Mashable for $200 million.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.720]   Come on.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   It never happens.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   Come on.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   Come on.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.720]   I've been hearing that.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   I worked there for a year and a half.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   I didn't work this.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.800]   I think Pete's floating these.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:51.040]   I think he's saying, hey, he's calling somebody and saying, hey, I got a good one for you.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.360]   I don't know if this if I could tell you this, but 200 million.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.520]   Because it never happens.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520]   No, no.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   All right.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.320]   I'm just I'm asking.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   It doesn't really it's not really in play.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.480]   It's just that he want there's.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.720]   Yeah, I don't think there's any.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:09.320]   You know, we can never get jolly who's on the show commonly.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.040]   She was at Mashable and left to go to adventure be.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.440]   Yeah, but she seems to have something bad to say.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.040]   Yeah, but she will never say it.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.520]   No, she's a nice person.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.840]   Yeah, well, that's true.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.800]   Ben Parr, we probably usually we warm even the nicest person can be worked.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   But you know, I have to say I have more respect for Mashable because Lance O'Lanoff is over
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   there.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   I have a lot of respect for them.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.720]   Former editor in chief of PC Magazine and another another crazy story that we can't
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.520]   figure out the genesis of.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.520]   How'd that happen?
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.360]   I want to know how that million guy.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   Oh, whatever mine.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.920]   I'll talk about that later.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.920]   So he's at Bloomberg.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.120]   Yeah, who owns that?
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.320]   Is Michael on that?
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   No, well, yes, actually.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.720]   It's a Peter nor does it.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.280]   But still on some majority shares, but he's not involved with the company.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.280]   Oh, that's too many more.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   He's busy.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   Yeah, running New York.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.240]   Did he have to do in order to be mayor?
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.880]   Did he have to kind of divest all the all that stuff?
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.720]   No, he could keep his his investment in the company.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.760]   But he is not involved in the blind trust or something.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.120]   Yeah, I guess that makes sense because otherwise he could like restructure the entire New York
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   City economy.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.480]   He's safer somehow.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   Huh?
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.720]   John could tell John's had two bottles of Pellegrino.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.520]   It's time to go to the bathroom now, John.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.560]   I'm not at your level with yet, Leo.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.400]   I actually get to put your fly up.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.880]   That refers to a conversation we had earlier after the age of 50.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.280]   For some reason, you you.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.080]   You some are trying to generalize about age, but it's about you men's pants.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.560]   The fly just goes down naturally.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.000]   I find myself walking around with gravity all the time.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.560]   I'll bet you do, especially around Petaluma where you're known as the fly boy.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.120]   I'm just going to stay quiet.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:11.160]   You're a wise, wise woman.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.920]   I want to talk about go to meeting from Citrix right now.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.800]   They're wondering if they purchased the wrong show.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   We love these guys.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:25.720]   Citrix has been a good supporter and good sponsor for Twit for many years.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.160]   I love doing their ads because we use their products all the time.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.320]   For instance, go to meeting, which we use every time we have a meeting.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.720]   Go to meeting with HD faces, especially.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.200]   It's fantastic.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.440]   Now you can actually join a meeting and have video from an iPad, which makes, "Oh, I need
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   to update my Flash Player."
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.080]   Don't you hate it when that happens.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:48.080]   You don't need it for HD faces, but you need it to play the video.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   That's something.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.080]   I hate that.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.280]   So go to meeting from Citrix was originally screen sharing for online meetings, but just
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.480]   gets better and better.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.760]   Now they've got video, which means you can see the people you're meeting with.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.200]   I can't tell you how important that is.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.360]   If you're meeting with a prospect to see what they are, there's somebody.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.120]   You see what their body language is saying about your pitch, either smiling or they're
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.800]   frowning, they're folding their arms across their legs.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.920]   It's how you get to know the people you work with.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.200]   Nowadays, we're all over the place, distributed everywhere.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.720]   The video makes a huge difference.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.440]   It helps you get better connected with all the people you depend on for your success.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.760]   You got to try this in business.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.560]   I want you to visit go to meeting.com.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.560]   There's a...
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.920]   Right underneath that video there.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.640]   There's a orange try at free button.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:41.400]   If you click that and use the offer code TWIT, 30 days free of go to meeting.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.120]   Simply put the best online sharing now with video looks great.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.320]   All you need is a webcam and internet connection.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:51.320]   And you can join meetings and use the video camera on an iPad and on a new iPad.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   It looks spectacular.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:57.400]   And I take meetings in the backyard and all the time.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.920]   It's just great.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.760]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.160]   We thank them for their support.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.320]   Speaking of iOS, we're starting to hear rumors.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.840]   I think we're still thinking probably the fall for iPhone 5, right?
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.840]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:11.840]   Maybe WWDC.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   That's June.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.680]   So they might announce something in June.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   iOS 6.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.680]   I doubt it.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.840]   No, you don't think so, Joanna?
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.720]   No, I think we'll definitely see iOS 6 previewed in June.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.160]   And I think we'll see the hardware announced in September and October.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.040]   In fact, what's strange about the rumors is, in fact, I just saw a rumor that said they
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.040]   haven't decided yet.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.560]   It's like they're kind of up in the air about what iPhone 5 or 6 or whatever they're going
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.520]   to call it will look like.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.080]   Whether it'll be liquid metal, whether they have metal at all, whether it'll be glass,
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.160]   like the current one, I don't know.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.920]   I'm sure it will look different.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.080]   One thing that does seem to be the case and Apple's been kind of making noises about
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   this.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.640]   So I'm not surprised is that iOS 6 will no longer feature Google Maps.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.800]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   Dumb.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   Dumb?
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   It's a bold standard, right?
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.480]   What if, though, and this is what people are saying, they could come up with some amazing
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.120]   maps that are better than Google Maps.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.320]   Well, this is that open source project that has all the open street maps.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.840]   A lot of people are jacked up about that.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.320]   Apple has bought now a number of mapping companies.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.000]   They bought PlaySpace in 2009, Poly9 in 2010.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.920]   Last year they got C3 technologies.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:30.920]   C3 was working on 3D mapping.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.240]   I think, okay, well, that's an interesting question.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.960]   Should they stick with Google Maps, which is not a differentiator, because everybody's
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.960]   got it.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.640]   In fact, Android does it better because it's Android.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   Right.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   Or should they say go their own way and maybe try to do something even better than Google
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   Maps?
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   Well, they should try.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   You love Google Maps.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   I like the navigator.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.640]   You sing its praises.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   You get them navigators, fantastic.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.960]   And the iPhone doesn't have that.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.720]   I mean, hopefully this new mapping system will have a GPS navigator.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.720]   It'll be nice.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.040]   Ah, maybe that's the point.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.520]   But that's not a big, you know, wow feature.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.440]   No, but the other phone has that.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.920]   And as we, well, that's the point.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   Every other phone has that.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.080]   Yeah, but you know, that Google one is so good.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:15.560]   Although, I was gotten to an argument with Markov, your friend, recently, you never provide
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   him on the show either.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.120]   No, I have invited him.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.560]   He says he doesn't cover tech anymore.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.160]   He's like, he's moved on.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   Yes, sure.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.280]   So anyway, he actually does, but he's writing science, supposedly.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.920]   Anyway, he says that he likes that open source one because I said, well, as campy as good
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.760]   as the Google one, he says, there's one little addition.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.200]   You can be driving down the road and you know, the way the Google one will also tell you
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.280]   if there's a roadblock and I'll take it around and all this kind of thing.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.760]   He says you'll be driving down the road and it says police ahead.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.560]   Because it's user contributed.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   Which is a ways, right?
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.000]   Is that what it's called?
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Was it ways?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   Was it ways?
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Was using that recently.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   So the ways, ways, ways knows where cops are.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.600]   Well, you'll see other people on the map who are using the app at that very moment.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.640]   And a lot of them will have, you know, they say if you have a passenger in the car, he
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.160]   can report, you know, increase in traffic.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.160]   Please.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.160]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.160]   Road work.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.800]   Yeah, it's a pretty cool piece of software.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.680]   You can avoid speed, drive.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.560]   But is that, oh, that's not open street maps.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.520]   That's an app separate app.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.520]   Or are they using open street maps?
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.880]   I don't pay any attention to any of this actually.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.440]   You don't drive.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.600]   He is a driver.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.760]   He just, he says, get me home.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.120]   Get me to the brick house.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.120]   To the Twitch content.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   Yes.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.120]   To the strip club James.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   Fronto.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.400]   I've been mean to you today and I really apologize.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   You're always mean to me.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.400]   I'm not always mean to me.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   Yes, you are.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.320]   Sometimes I mean and I apologize.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.880]   You can be mean back if it suits you.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.560]   It makes you feel better.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.880]   I'll work on it.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.920]   It's very difficult for me to have any kind of a negative approach to these things.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:56.360]   You're such a positive, optimistic.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.400]   My motto is you have nothing bad to say.
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   Don't say anything at all.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.640]   I think you're so right.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.320]   Nobody ever went wrong by saying something nice.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   Exactly.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.440]   So that's my motto.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   Go on.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440]   You're stymied here.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.680]   I don't know what to say.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:19.560]   So OpenStreetMap.org is the data that Apple used for iPhoto.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.920]   I don't know if it's going to use this data.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.440]   I think they're going to have their own stuff.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:32.960]   I'm confident that Apple can make 3D maps and that they can get it right where streets
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.680]   are.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:40.720]   My concern is that Google is so good where I can type in part of a name and it knows
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.320]   which place I'm looking for.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   Right.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320]   Google has more than Apple's.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.000]   And unlike a lot of these other products, when you go to someplace, Google will ask you
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   if you got there.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.800]   It says, "Is this the right spot?"
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.640]   And they show you the pictures of the place which is kind of the coolest part.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.400]   You know, there's the picture what it should be.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.680]   And then you can tell them that, "No, this isn't it.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.080]   It's only happened to me once."
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.440]   Well, that's one thing that doesn't do much crowdsourcing.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.400]   One thing lacking in OpenStreetMap, which is all crowdsourced, because it's an open source
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.840]   project, they don't have satellite, they don't have terrain, they don't have street view,
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.720]   all of that costs money and they don't have that.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.360]   They only have what people have given them as map information with their GPSs.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.120]   And you can imagine by hand.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:23.720]   You know, Apple has been cozying up, and especially with Siri, with Yelp recently.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   That would be...
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.520]   Yeah, that was what I was just about to say.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.520]   That would be the best.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520]   Right.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.360]   Like, what I worry about is the infrastructure that Google has with reviews and information.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.560]   You know, it brings it all in, it looks really clean.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.720]   And how would Apple compete with that?
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   Right.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.040]   You need to team up with the third party to provide that information.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.680]   Well, I don't care anymore because I'm using the new Bing.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   Yeah, it's got foxes.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.360]   Why do people laugh like you say that?
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.120]   What is funny about that?
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.320]   They say, "When did they put the video on?"
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.880]   I don't know, that's the first time I've seen that one.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   They don't...
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880]   They're cute.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.920]   Because you can't go wrong with little critters.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.360]   Those things are nasty, those foxes.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360]   Makes me want to use fireflies.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360]   Everybody lives in the country.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.360]   Oh, good one.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   Good observation.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.800]   See, most of the time it's stills.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   Nope, that was moving.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   Was it?
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.600]   Yeah, the flowers are popping or something.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   No, it's huge.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.400]   John, what you've been taking?
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.720]   Wasn't that a mushroom that popped into that?
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   What you been taking?
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.880]   How'd you like Roger Waters the wall?
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   Speaking of mushrooms.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880]   See, this is moving.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.040]   No, it's not moving.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   Those are static.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   You push me, pull you.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.400]   No, no, no, that's these are the little...
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.400]   This is the stupid thing that Bing doesn't have the little...
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400]   Oh, that's idiotic.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.000]   The little high, little thing.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   You never use Bing.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.480]   I don't use Bing.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.920]   I look at it once in a while and I downloaded something recently that put Bing in my...
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.280]   as a default and I just found it very annoying.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.120]   See, now you click that and you'll get the llama song.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.720]   I truly did not want.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.000]   Thank God Flash isn't working.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.360]   I was at this Bing event.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.600]   Yeah, because they're going to do more social.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   What are they doing?
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   That's different.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   Yeah, thank you for keeping us on track.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.600]   It was a Bing event.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.600]   It's there for.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.040]   Yeah, they had an event in San Francisco to unveil this new version of Bing and...
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.600]   You must have packed them in.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   Jolie was there.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   No, good.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   What do you think?
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   What are they doing?
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   What's the question?
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.360]   So, they were saying that their big insight is that integrating social with your search
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.000]   results is not working.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   They had it.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   They were the first to do it.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.800]   They were putting Facebook in a year.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   They were putting Facebook into Bing.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.560]   Yes, so then they're in the search work.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:49.240]   So now they're creating a wall between social search results and web search results.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:55.120]   So you'll have a series of columns.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.120]   On the left, you'll have the organic web search results.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.120]   That's these, yeah.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.800]   In the center, you'll have what they call a snapshot with additional information,
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   maps or...
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   I'm not getting it yet.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   Right.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   Maybe if I start rolling it out next week.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   Right.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   Yeah, I'm using it, but I got the special press house.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   The special press one.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   Okay.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   Right.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   Okay.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   And then on the right side, you'll have this...
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   It's so awesome.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   You'll have this...
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   Is it really Joanna?
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   I actually really do like it.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   Tell us about it.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   You like Bing?
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   What do you like about it?
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   Because I...
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   You know what?
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   I think the world might be ripe.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   I think Bing is ripe.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   I think Bing is ripe.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   For a transition from Google.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   Why don't you think there's a little undercurrent against Google?
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   No.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.800]   And if something were better than Google, the people would go there even if it were Microsoft?
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.800]   Except for the last thing you said, yes.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   Well, I mean...
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   Well, I mean...
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   Mark was doing a good job explaining why...
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   Actually, why I think it is the social is better integrated than it was before.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   Because it's not as integrated.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   Like, if you don't want to look at it, it's off to the right and you can close it if you
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   want.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   But with Google, when you search, you know, they're bringing up the Google+ search results.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   And it's sort of in your face if you click on to...
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   You know, it says all your little friends who like this, so they might know about it.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   So with this, like, you can close it.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   It's off to the side.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   I wish I could show it right now.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.800]   I think I have...
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   Let's see, Google.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.800]   So here, this is from Danny Sullivan's article.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.800]   There's also something going on with Google that's annoying.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   What's that?
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.800]   You know, they changed their interface on the search results.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   So the first search result comes on.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   And just as you're going to go up and click on the number one, it swaps it out for some kind of a little ad or a sub ad or some crap.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.800]   Have you noticed this?
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   No.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.800]   So you're saying you're going to click on a link.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   You get...
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   And it goes...
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   And it puts something else in there?
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   Yes!
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800]   That is not right.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800]   Google's doing that?
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   At the top, at the very top, they have some little bogus...
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Instead of the way they used to do advertising...
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   Does it say punch the monkey?
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   Because if that...
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   If it says that, I don't think it's Google.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   So this is Bing and a penguin.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.800]   So Danny Sullivan has a head-to-head search about Bing's...
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   I presume this is the new social... the new Bing social search compared to Google's search plus your world, which is their version of social search.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   Which is only Google's own social network.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   Key plus.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.800]   It's all G-plus.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   The potential advantage that Microsoft seems to be starting to milk right now is that they're integrating...
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.800]   Or they plan to integrate with everybody.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   And they're going to launch this week with Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ integration on that...
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.800]   And LinkedIn is coming or something, right?
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   And LinkedIn and Quora and several others are coming in the summer, they said.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   Is this it or is this Google?
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   This is it, right?
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800]   That's it.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   That's it.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.800]   So he searched for New Girl because everybody loves Zoe Deschanel.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.800]   And you get on the right friends who might know about New Girl...
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   This stinks.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   So that's Elizabeth said, "I like New Girl."
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   People who know...
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   The show or the search engine?
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   The search engine.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   And then if you hover your mouse over...
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   Zoe Deschanel has two tweets, you'll get her tweets.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   I'm not crazy about the show.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   I like the search engine a lot.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.800]   No wonder Facebook is going to win.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   Well, this is all Facebook data.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800]   Oh, no, there's Twitter data too.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   The Facebook...
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.800]   Well, actually, you know, there's something to be said about that too.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   Like, I think Facebook search is really bad.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   Like, I...
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]   You're working on that.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   You know, if I wanted to, like, search for something I knew someone had said about Justin Bieber,
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.800]   perhaps, on Facebook, I like having no easy way to do that.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   Right.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   Right.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   But if I might...
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   Is that going to be your example?
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   That's a good example.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.800]   That's a good example.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   You know, I don't know if you guys know, but, you know, there's a little bit of a meme about
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   my love for Justin Bieber in the tech industry.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   So...
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   But I'm searching here on Bing for Justin Bieber.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.800]   And I get all the news, but on the side comes up, all these people who might know about
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   Justin Bieber and activity about someone who shared about Justin Bieber.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.800]   So, it's actually like a good workaround to search Facebook.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.800]   I like Justin Bieber.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   Beager.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   Beager, you see.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.800]   You know, Justin Bieber should just...
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   That's so hip, yeah.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   Justin Giger.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   Justin Giger should...
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   What?
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.800]   No, that's...
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   But I...
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   It looks like, actually, there's, like, some tie in here.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.800]   I just...
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   I searched for Justin Bieber and this is what I got, which is exactly what you'd want.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800]   I presume on Facebook.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   But I know exactly what you're talking about, Joanna, which...
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.200]   And partly that's because Facebook is in this weird position where a lot of this data was
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.640]   supposed to be private.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.800]   And so, I don't know how they search because they can see...
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   They can see everything, but you are not supposed to see everything.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   So, I guess they would condition the search results with, okay, what's public, what's not
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.800]   public, what's Leo allowed to see, what's Joanna allowed to see.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   And I don't know.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   I think I'd see their problem there, right?
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800]   They don't have an open database.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.800]   They want an open database.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   They don't have one.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   Microsoft is facing that...
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.800]   I mean, I talked to some of their engineers.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800]   They're facing that same problem.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   They have a problem.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.320]   Trying to personalize search and being partnered so closely with Facebook, being able to use
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.720]   their data, but only being able to use what Facebook says they can use.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   And it's...
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.560]   You know, you can only get access to what you would have access to on Facebook in terms
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.160]   of what you can see from your friends.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.520]   But Microsoft can't get access to, say, the newsfeed rankings.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.760]   So it doesn't know who your closest friends are as Facebook has ranked them.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.240]   And in that respect, Facebook would have a pretty significant advantage if they were
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   to do a search.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.800]   And that's, by the way, Google's argument for using Google+.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.360]   We can't depend...
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.240]   We can't build a service based on what some other company might do or not do.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.000]   That's an argument for why Google would not want you to use Facebook.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Right.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   And Bing.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   And Google...
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   It doesn't really help us.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.680]   What Google said, what Matt Cut said, is, look, we had this search plus your world using
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.640]   Twitter, but then the Twitter deal went away.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.320]   And we don't want our engineers just don't want to build something based on something
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   that might go away.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320]   There's...
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.680]   Well, we control Google+, we're going to get those social signals from a service we control.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.680]   It's easier for...
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   That makes sense, right?
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   Right.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680]   It's funny, actually, we...
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.720]   When I was at the Verge, we broke a story about this service called...
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:16.440]   I guess it's called Soap.CL or Social, which was Microsoft's research project on search.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   They were trying to make search social and sharing your searches.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.400]   And I don't know if anything ever happened with that.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.880]   They did open it up, but I've been there if there's going to be some sort of tie-in with
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.680]   that as well.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.440]   It is a difficult problem to solve, right?
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.080]   Because it's clear that search alone is less valuable than it used to be, that more
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.960]   or more if you could massage it with location, if you're searching for a restaurant, location
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.520]   is useful.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.200]   And maybe some social signals, if you're searching for a restaurant, maybe what your friends
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.760]   think about the restaurant is useful.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.360]   But I hear people complaining people bitch about it all the time saying, "I don't want
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.480]   to know what John thinks about a restaurant."
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.640]   See, I would want to know what John thinks about wine, but I might not want to know what
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.880]   John thinks about a high-life frontons.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   So those...
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   I want to know what John thinks about being.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   I'm not really clear on it.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   What do you think about being?
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880]   Sucks.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   Being sucks.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   Yeah, totally sucks.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   I don't want being to do well.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.520]   It doesn't have enough bots.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.480]   I guess also it's an issue of trust, isn't it?
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.880]   Do we trust being?
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   No.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880]   Do we trust Microsoft?
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880]   Microsoft.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.960]   Well, that's an intraniali Patel where it's a very interesting article on the Verge about
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.480]   all of this and in the context of the new G-Drive terms of service.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   Because Google did...
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.680]   This is a little bit of an old story, but I think it's kind of germane to all of this.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.200]   Google did what every company does when they write a terms of service.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.560]   They say we reserve the rights to copy, modify, distribute, and any form your data.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.840]   But they also said right before that, but we're not asserting a right to own it.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.320]   We just say in order to give you what you want, like document sharing, we have to put
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.680]   this legalese in here.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.680]   And NELI writes a very...
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.600]   And as a result, of course, everybody's freaking out saying, "I'm not going to use Google Drive
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.880]   because they're going to publish my data publicly, even though Google's very clear.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880]   We can't.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880]   We don't want to.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   That's not the point.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   We just have to put this language in."
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.760]   NELI then analyzes what Dropbox says, what Microsoft says for SkyDrive and for all these
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.760]   other services.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.760]   They all say pretty much the same thing.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.760]   He says, "It's interesting.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.800]   Dropbox attempts to make it friendly."
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   They use the word "stuff."
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.160]   What are we going to do with your stuff?
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.920]   And he says, "Because it's friendly and vague, it may actually be more risky because they're
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.560]   not as clear, not as precise in their language, but what they can and cannot do."
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.600]   It may be, in fact, even though you get scared by this Google agreement that it's a better
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.560]   agreement for you than the Dropbox agreement.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.200]   But he finally goes on to say, "Ultimately, it doesn't matter what's in the terms of service.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.960]   It's who do you trust?"
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:43.000]   And if you're going to use cloud services, and I would submit the same thing if you're
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.720]   going to use search, who do you trust is what really comes down to it?
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.800]   Because you don't want search results polluted by, maybe you gave him a couple of bucks, so
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.960]   his results are a little bit higher.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   You don't want that.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   It happens.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   Of course it happens.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.760]   It's a really good article on Dropbox maybe over a year ago.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.760]   The New Yorker?
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760]   The New Yorker.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.240]   I occasionally read The New Yorker.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.600]   No, I mean, it's hard to read because of the articles.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.760]   It is hard to read, yes.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.560]   But the wrong points and everything.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.400]   But this particular one, they become very...
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.880]   Lately, they become very...
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.840]   Everyone's trying to get into the act is what you're saying.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:25.520]   The angle they took on this is only in America will you get millions of people to trust someone
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.600]   you don't know, nothing about Dropbox, brand new company.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.600]   Right.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.600]   Here are my new, you own my files.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600]   And you're giving them everything.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.600]   Right.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:43.800]   And it's sort of this innovators can really take off in the US because this phenomenon exists.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   And what makes this paranoia?
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.800]   It's a paranoia, as you'd like to imagine.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.800]   In Germany, they're very paranoid.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.040]   That's why Google keeps running up against these privacy issues and blurming anything.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.320]   Well, that's because they've had experience with the kind of things going bad.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.880]   Here's a perfect example, back to the Verge again.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   They're promotions.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   This is with you and the Verge to...
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   I like the Verge.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880]   I'm sorry, Joanne.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   We don't think so.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.880]   They're walking out of here.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.880]   They're walking out of here.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.880]   What?
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.480]   We said something?
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.600]   Going with your Verge thing.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.240]   They're talking about this new service, Dropler Pro.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.520]   File sharing service goes big time.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.240]   100 gigabytes of cloud storage, $3 a month.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.960]   That's a great price, great thing.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.680]   And then you're hitting the nail on the head.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]   Who are these people?
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.000]   It doesn't matter.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.640]   I'll sign up.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.120]   I mean, this is exactly...
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120]   This is how...
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.960]   I don't know if that's a bad thing because I think for the most part they're fairly trustworthy.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.600]   And certainly people are paying attention in terms of trust.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.600]   Dropbox got in law of trouble when people realized that they had the keys to the encrypted
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.520]   data on your Dropbox.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:52.840]   So there's two companies that do the consolidation of all your sky drives and cheap free services.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   Right, right.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.000]   Into one lump.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.320]   One virtual drive so you can just save and...
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.400]   I've been interested in tempted to that because everybody offers a few gigabytes for free.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.840]   If you got all the free services and you could aggregate them all together, you'd have hundreds
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.840]   of gigabytes.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840]   Yeah, free.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.360]   It's a great idea.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.720]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.680]   I can't remember the name of the two companies unfortunately.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   You know what?
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.680]   Ask the chatroom.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.680]   The chatroom...
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680]   Actually, I just wore a gutter from it.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680]   They will provide.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   They will provide.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.640]   I'll tell you what, while they're cogitating, we will take a break and come back with more.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.360]   This is Twit.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.760]   And episode 353, I'm Leo LaPorte with John C. de Vorek who is host of many great shows
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.920]   like The No Agenda Show and No Agenda Show.com.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.520]   Now twice weekly.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.520]   Now twice weekly.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]   There you go.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.520]   Okay chat room.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.520]   You won this week.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.520]   We'll see what happens next week.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.680]   Is that a drinking game?
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.240]   This is a chatroom's got this thing going about you saying that's good.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.760]   They said last week you didn't say now twice weekly.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.160]   No, and I said you said something.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   I forgot what it was.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.120]   I said something else stupid like, "Oh, Adam Curry's on that show."
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.120]   Something like that.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.120]   Something like that.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.080]   And also many other shows, all of which are a challenge for it.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   I can't.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   I just can't keep track.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   Yeah, sure.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.080]   I can't.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.760]   And you do nothing of course by comparison.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.120]   I do 12 shows.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120]   I do.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   So that's probably a lot.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:17.120]   You think?
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.560]   But most of them are weekly.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.360]   So it's not like 12 shows a day.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.280]   No, but you're on every day.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.240]   It's streaming.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.960]   These never even get recorded except by the real Nutball fans out there that record everything
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   you do.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.960]   Everything I do.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.400]   Yeah, it's like, this by the way is becoming a social phenomenon.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.160]   It's called public archiving.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.360]   Where people save your stuff.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360]   Everything.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.160]   Everybody's saving everybody else's stuff including music.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   I mean, if somebody-
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.000]   I just spare for kids today because you know, you can't get in a fight at a high school
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.120]   without 20 cell phones coming out and taping it and putting it on YouTube.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.120]   Is that what happened to you?
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.520]   I beat up this kid the other day and I-
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.920]   [laughter]
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.280]   It's not as easy as it used to be.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.040]   Nah, it used to be easy.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:04.360]   Also here, Joanna Stern from ABC and Mark Million from Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.560]   Maybe it should be big and cross-bloom-broom business week.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.560]   Yeah, that was waiting for Jimmy Dogg.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.720]   That's a Bloomberg Business Week, man.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.960]   I love that thing.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.200]   That sounds more like Dean Martin.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.200]   Yeah, it does.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.160]   Fresh if I had that drink.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.120]   Let's talk about carbonite backup.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.040]   Carbonite automatic, continuous, unlimited backup for your computer files.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.200]   You gots the backup.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.200]   I got to tell you this over and over again and I get calls every day.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.440]   I get calls on the radio show people saying, "I lost all my data.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   What do I do?"
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.640]   Today, I got a call was nice.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.200]   He said, "I want to thank you because I sign up for carbonite one month later.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.960]   My hard drive died and I had prior to that no backup at all.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.760]   I feel very lucky.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.920]   I want you to feel lucky.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.920]   I want you to go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.400]   They have a number of plans now.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.800]   It used to be that it was $59 for everything on your internal drive.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.360]   People said, "But I want a backup external drive."
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.680]   So they have that now.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.120]   People said, "Oh, I have a business.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.200]   They have a business version with multiple computers."
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.920]   So pick the plan you like.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.920]   Then use the offer code TWIT.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.080]   You could try it free for at least two weeks.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.840]   I think in the business plan, you could try it for a month free.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.160]   No credit card needed, nothing.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.320]   Just your email address, a password and the offer code TWIT.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.000]   Now in those two weeks, you'll see what it's like to have your data always continuously
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   backed up.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.160]   It's so great.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.000]   It's just peace of mind and the price is very affordable.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   It's also cloud storage.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.960]   When you're talking about cloud storage, $59 a year and there's not a limit.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.160]   It's just whatever you got for $5, less than $5 a month as long as it's on that internal
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160]   drive.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.360]   I mean, it's a remarkable deal.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.640]   You also have cloud storage part of the deal.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.320]   You can log on to your carbonate account on any computer or use their free iPhone or Android
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.680]   apps and there's your stuff.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.680]   So it's cloud storage.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.360]   It's automatic, continuous backup.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.120]   You control the encryption keys by the way.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.120]   You want privacy, no problem.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.480]   Carbonite offers it with you.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.760]   They're encryption.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.080]   Only you can decrypt.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.960]   Only you, not them.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.320]   So it's absolutely private.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.400]   Offsite computer backup done right.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.760]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.680]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.160]   By the way, if you decide to buy, continue to use the offer code to it because you'll
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:19.200]   get 14 months for the price of 12, two free months when you use that code.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   Twin.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   Twin.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   Okay.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.280]   So Gladdennet is one of these services.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280]   Gladdennet.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.280]   Oh, what's this up?
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.280]   It's not one I liked.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.280]   They looked at it.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.160]   Another one taught Otik XO or something.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.160]   I can't even pronounce it.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.160]   And that one is not, I never heard of that one.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.440]   There's a third one.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.600]   So at least there's three.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.880]   No, Carbonite is TNO.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.320]   Absolutely it's TNO, Echo Echo.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.520]   Somebody's asking, trust no one.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520]   That's the acronym.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   It's Otrixo.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   That's the other one.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   Otikxo.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   Otikxo.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   Otixo.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.520]   What are these?
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.520]   These are aggregators.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.520]   It's Gladdennet.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.520]   That's one other one.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.520]   So they, no, it's not flank stack.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.360]   Access all your online files from a single app, really.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360]   Hmm.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.880]   Copy and paste between cloud services.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.280]   There was a third one.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.040]   You know, I use a bunch of these.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.040]   I use Arc.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.200]   I use a Spider Oak.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.840]   I use Dropbox, Christmas Carbonite.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.360]   No, it's for the Mac.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:17.800]   But it seems to me that if you found one that you really liked, it would probably be the
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   way to go.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.800]   Probably be easier, yeah.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.800]   I use Dropbox.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.800]   Everybody uses Dropbox.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.800]   And you don't worry.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.800]   An Evernote, actually.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800]   I love Evernote.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.800]   Yes, and Ece.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.720]   It also does not have a strong encryption system at all.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.160]   You can encrypt individual messages.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.160]   Right.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.160]   If you pay for premium.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.000]   Yeah, if you pay for premium.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.600]   I think people don't really care that much about the encryption issue.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   I don't know.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.440]   So if you're a physician, you have to.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.600]   There's some professions we have legal obligations to.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.240]   But you apparently don't care that Carbonite can access your data.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.240]   Who cares?
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.040]   Yeah, I mean, I don't put work files on there.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040]   You can't.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.040]   And then actually for--
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.040]   That's wild.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.040]   It's a financial company.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040]   So for SEC rules.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.040]   Legal.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.040]   You're not allowed.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.160]   And same thing with the physician.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.080]   I think it's SME storage is the one I was impressed with.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.680]   Well use it and let's then come back to us, will you?
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.680]   You don't use any of these.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.680]   You don't use Dropbox.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680]   I do.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.680]   You've got a shoebox.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.680]   I do.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   I got a shoebox.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   John's into a more ex shoebox.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.680]   He's print everything.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   Very secure.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   But it's shoebox.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   You know, Will Hurst.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.000]   He does email, but the way he does email, he has somebody print every message.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.760]   And he's got a stack of messages.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.760]   And then he tells them what to write.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.400]   And then they mail it out.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.400]   That's the way to do email.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   That's the way to do email.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   That's the--
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   A lot of executives do that.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   Yeah, a lot of executive.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   Big shots do that.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   Big shots.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.880]   That's a way of building up big shots.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.240]   Google and Mozilla are both a little upset with Windows 8 on tablets because Microsoft
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:49.520]   says if you're going to make an app for Windows 8 tablets, it has to be Metro interface.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.360]   You don't have access to the desktop.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.440]   We have access to the desktop.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.560]   We have internet explorer on the desktop, but not you.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.560]   For ARM-based--
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.560]   For ARM system.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560]   For the Windows on ARM.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.080]   Unfortunately, we have to say Windows RT because that's what they've decided to call this.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.760]   What does RT stand for?
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.200]   I'm not going to call it that.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.400]   I'm not either.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   I like--
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.400]   Just not going to do it.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.400]   --Woe.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.400]   Windows on ARM.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   I like that.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   Woe.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   Woe.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   That's why I said--
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.400]   Yeah, actually, I'm actually very concerned about explaining to the general public what this
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   is.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   I agree.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.400]   You know what, here's the good news, Joanna?
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.280]   I was worried about it before I worked at ABC News.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280]   Now you're really--
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.800]   And now I work at ABC News and it's going to be my job to explain it.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.800]   Here's the good news.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.000]   It's going to be complicated.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.080]   RT stands for Ruins Tablets.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:39.360]   The good news is public doesn't care about--
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.680]   RT stands for Really Temporary.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.680]   --all you have to do is because I do this on the radio.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   Same thing, Joanna.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680]   I'm talking to real people.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   You're so witty, John.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680]   You're so witty, John.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.320]   Royal Turkey is what it really means.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.720]   Well, the funny thing is there's WinRT, which is the kernel services the programmers use,
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.960]   which stands for Windows Real Time.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:01.960]   I don't know what Windows RT, which is Windows 8 on an ARM tablet.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960]   I don't know what--
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960]   Royal Turkey.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960]   Really terrible.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   Revolting tirade.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   Rotten tomatoes.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.440]   We should have a contest.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   We could.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440]   Because they never said what it is.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.440]   Tearings.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.440]   Great material.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.440]   Yeah, really truncated.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.440]   Really tedious.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.440]   Word.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.520]   That's not a good image.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520]   Ribbon torture.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520]   Retweet.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520]   That's the problem.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.640]   If you search for Windows RT, you'll find all these retweets.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.560]   It's not what you're going to want.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   I would--
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.920]   It really is runtime, right?
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.920]   No, it's going to be runtime.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.680]   I think it is for WinRT.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.680]   It's runtime.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.680]   That's a very interesting--
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.080]   But I don't know what it is on the tablet.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.080]   What?
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.800]   I'm hearing things that are delay here.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   I just heard something about Rasta, Fari, and testicles.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.560]   You heard right.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.120]   I don't know if Microsoft ever said what it stands for.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.120]   They didn't.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.280]   So in any event, the larger issue is that--
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   I don't know.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.400]   Is it an issue that if I were a Mozilla or Google, I might be upset.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.360]   You can't really put Chrome or--
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   Or--
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.520]   Well, let's start with one premise.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520]   Firefox.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.000]   No one is going to use this.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   The tablet.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.200]   That's why I'm telling Joanna.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.200]   She doesn't have to worry.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.720]   Yeah, no, I think you're right.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.400]   People aren't going to be coming to you saying, what is this great new tablet for Microsoft?
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   Are they?
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.400]   What?
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   I think they are.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400]   You do.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.600]   Boot into Metro, which in that case anyone buys a computer will be using it.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   No, no, no.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.040]   I mean, I don't think people will really be referring to it as RT.
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.720]   I think Windows ARM tablets will be-- will sell and people--
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.520]   That's even more confusing.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   What's this arm?
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.160]   Do I hold it on my arm?
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.080]   That's my point.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:53.280]   And my point is that it's going to get very confusing, I think, for what is supported on
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:59.680]   these ARM tablets, these RT tablets, versus Windows Intel tablets.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.280]   Because there are certain things that will not work.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   Right.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.760]   And explaining that becomes very hard.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.200]   And that's exactly the issue, which is that Microsoft says if you're going to put apps
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:18.080]   on our tablets, the Windows on ARM tablets, you have to use Metro only as your interface.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.720]   There will not be-- you will not be able to use a desktop app.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.920]   You will not be able to sell a desktop app.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.720]   We will not put a desktop app on our tablet.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.400]   So Mozilla and Chrome are saying, wait a minute, how am I going to do Firefox?
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.680]   You have-- and this is where the anti-competitive issue is.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.640]   This is where the really big debate goes.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.640]   You have--
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.160]   But Microsoft's work gets complicated because if you had an Intel tablet, it would have
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.560]   been a Windows RT.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.360]   And you would actually be able to use desktop apps.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   Exactly.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.160]   And if you have a desktop, you can use desktop apps.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:49.400]   If you have Windows 8 on a desktop, you're not stuck with Metro.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.800]   It's only on Windows on ARM.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:57.040]   But it's going to get back to this Department of Justice action in 1998 against Microsoft,
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.320]   where they got to get in trouble because they bundled the browser, remember, and they said,
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.320]   no, no, you have to make sure that there's a competitive landscape for other browsers.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:10.160]   And here Microsoft is shipping a tablet that, in fact, will only run it in an Explorer.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.600]   Now Microsoft's point of view on this is, well, we don't have monopoly status in the
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.600]   tablet market.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.600]   And they never will.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.440]   And they never will at this rate.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.920]   But I think that that's not what the whole issue is.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:27.200]   The issue of monopoly is, are you using your monopoly in one market to give you leverage
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.720]   in other markets?
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.680]   So I think the DOJ could very reasonably say, wait a minute.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.320]   But I think they've kicked in enough on the political campaign front that's not going
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.320]   to happen.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320]   It's a decent point.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.480]   They don't have a monopoly.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.440]   I mean, Apple does this and they kind of do have a monopoly in tablets right now.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.880]   But no, but Apple does.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.880]   There are many browsers.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.880]   There's enough.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.880]   Right.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.840]   They all are required to run WebKit though, or use operas render.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.880]   Operate gets around this by rendering on their servers and sending back what are essentially
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.560]   images that you're scrolling through.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.640]   But you can't put the Gecko Firefox engine.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.960]   That's interesting.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.360]   So why is it Firefox and Google and Firefox pitching about that?
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360]   It's a good thing.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   I think they're more concerned about, you know, someone's going to go to Best Buy and
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.360]   buy a new computer.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   They're going to take it home.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.360]   It's going to have Windows 8 on it.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:23.120]   It's going to boot most likely in the metro by default.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.120]   Right.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.840]   And odds are they're never going to use a classic app.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.200]   And so if they want to use a web browser, they'll use whichever one works.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.320]   So there's so Chrome and Mozilla are more worried about the desktop.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.760]   This isn't really about the tablets.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.680]   This is about the desktop.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.680]   Right.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.760]   I think that's what they should be worried about.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.920]   That's absolutely what they're worried about because their Metro apps will work just fine.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.760]   You know, and they might even be nicer looking than Internet Explorer because they typically
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760]   happen.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760]   Right.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.120]   But they won't be able to have a desktop version.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.360]   And that's been sort of the sale of all of these, right?
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:03.760]   These Windows 8 tablets that we hear are going to be able to be docked and turned into, let's
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.160]   say, a laptop solution.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.240]   But people will get them out of the box and won't be able to put on desktop apps on the
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.680]   ARM-based tablets.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.200]   So I actually think it's just going to be incredibly confusing.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.160]   And I'm waiting for Microsoft to sort of say, well, this is how we're going to market it.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.200]   Deutsche Telekom supposedly discussing a merger between T-Mobile and Metro PCS.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.200]   Okay.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.200]   You're right.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.480]   There's nothing to say.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.440]   For rise and refuse to help police locate an unconscious man until they pay his phone
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.800]   bill.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.280]   This is by the way.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.680]   That can't be true.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.160]   This is the problem you were going to start to see when we start turning over a lot of
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.040]   our banking to the phone company.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:56.440]   The Times reporter of Carleton, a 62 year old carol and area man was found unconscious and
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.720]   unresponsive Thursday morning during intense search overnight by Carroll County sheriff's
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   deputies.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:07.320]   He saw his bill in Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper and the patrols airplane.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.520]   Sheriff Williams said he attempted to use the man's cell phone signal to locate him, but
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:16.160]   the man was behind on his phone bill and the Verizon operator refused to connect the signal
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.520]   until the sheriff's department agreed to pay the overdue bill.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:27.200]   After some disagreement, Sheriff Williams paid $20 on the phone bill and found the man.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.480]   That is just sick.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.160]   It is totally sick.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.920]   And it should be it seems it seems actionable.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.880]   I think somebody should sue somebody over that.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.280]   No, no comment on this from Verizon.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.480]   Somebody who owns Verizon stocks should go to the board meeting.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.760]   It could just be a world operator.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.440]   They're they work on commission.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.920]   Are you excited Harry Potter's on the Kindle?
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:57.640]   He is excited Harry Potter's on the Kindle.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.960]   You know, you could get Harry Potter.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.800]   You had to go to Potter more.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.400]   JK Rowling special private site, which I can't run because it's heavily in flash.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.960]   And apparently this computer doesn't have flash on it.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.960]   Thank you, Apple.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.920]   If you go to Potter more, you could buy it and then you would have to cross load it,
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.560]   and then you could actually get it in the Kindle borrowing library.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.520]   You have to be a prime member.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.320]   Oh, well, what's the borrowing library?
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.320]   It's cool.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.600]   Book of months free.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.440]   I mean, it is a you have to wonder how like they structured that deal.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.720]   I mean, was because they want more prime members.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.800]   Was it because, you know, JK Rowling was seriously been protecting her ebooks?
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800]   I don't know.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.080]   I think I saw a quote from Rowling where she said something like they're giving me a
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.080]   cost of money.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.080]   A lot of money.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.080]   Of course that's it.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.560]   So, so then it's that it's just Amazon wanting to get the prime member.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.200]   It's great promotion and they just got it, right?
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:59.320]   We just talked about the whole mechanism of how you would get free lending on Amazon
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.320]   on the Kindle.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.080]   All you have to do is pay $75 for prime.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:07.080]   And by the way, you get free two days shipping.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.080]   It's Amazon on the list.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.600]   No, and I've been trying to get them for years as an advertiser.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600]   Oh, Audible.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.600]   Here's another story.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   Audible.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.560]   Now, elderly husband and wife, Arthur and Madeline Morris die.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560]   Yes.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.360]   And crash near their Catskills home because they couldn't get a cell signal.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.160]   There's more to this story, I think.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.720]   This is from the Daily News.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.720]   Which is a good paper.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.480]   Vastion of editorial integrity.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   No, it's not.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.720]   No, I like the Daily News.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.720]   It's not the post.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.040]   It's tabloid, but it's, you know, it's not the post you say, as you say.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.920]   What do you read, what do you read, Joanna Stern?
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.520]   You walk out the door.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:47.200]   I see you somehow, it's like about breakfast at Tiffany's moment.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.360]   You're Joanna go lightly.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.280]   You walk out the door.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.520]   You say goodbye to the cat.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.520]   You go downstairs.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.520]   There's the news man.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.840]   He's been there for 50 years.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.620]   He says, "Hey, Mr.
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:57.960]   And how you doing?
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.560]   You want the paper today?"
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:02.520]   And you say, "I'll take them all, Billy."
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.880]   And he gives you the times, the posts, the Daily News.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:06.880]   Which one do you read for us?
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.880]   And the observer.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.120]   We can do that.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.620]   Okay.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.560]   Does the young man observe or
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.960]   would that the Times the daily
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.280]   news?
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.960]   Observer Bloemblar Business Week.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.700]   Yeah, I know they're good researchers.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:25.000]   Hey, so, and you forgot your
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.800]   favorite with the yellow on green.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.520]   I definitely I don't buy news
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.640]   papers. Very often. And by the
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.440]   time. You're killing them. Yeah,
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.640]   I'm getting really annoyed with
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.840]   that little paywall. So you need
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.240]   to subscribe. Joy and a stir.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.080]   Yes, I actually have to do that,
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.680]   which means Billy is going to
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.440]   start. I find myself trying to
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.280]   switch browsers and then I just
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.480]   give up and I'm like, I'll just
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.680]   read this on my iPad. It's very
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.680]   frustrating. Yeah, it really is.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.520]   So you mean it's a cookie? So if
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.720]   you use the different browser,
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.360]   you're 10 per browser. I don't
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.960]   know if that's actually worked.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   I want to say it has worked. I
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.560]   think you definitely tried it.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.200]   Unless you're maybe if you're
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.640]   logged in. So those of us who
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.120]   have multiple devices, we could
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.360]   read hundreds of articles. Oh,
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.960]   yeah. Oh, I've used up the iPad.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.960]   I think I'll go to the laptop.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.120]   Wow. Wow. Here's an interesting
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.000]   I don't read I don't read the
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.760]   newspaper. Twitter developing
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.200]   original sports content. You
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.200]   better understand how this could
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.720]   be true. Let me this. I don't
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.160]   even really give a lot of sports
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.880]   content on Twitter. Yeah. Well,
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.720]   so they put in a help wanted ad
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   for a sports editorial associate
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.720]   producer. Kind of a title. The
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.720]   freelance position requires a
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.160]   producer to monitor and curate a
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.040]   live stream of Twitter sports
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.320]   content and write pithy smart
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.600]   content in under 140 characters.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.880]   You know, I didn't know Twitter
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.640]   was creating tweets. Yeah,
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.880]   because you know, God knows there's
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.440]   not enough of them. They have
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.560]   these curated accounts like I
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.160]   know they do. Twitter media.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.520]   Oh, that's interesting. I didn't
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.200]   know that media news and tips on
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.400]   how to use Twitter. So maybe
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.720]   they'll have a Twitter sports
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.840]   feed. I mean, ESPN does quite a
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.120]   bit of Twitter stuff on air. And
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.640]   now News Corp is, you know,
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.200]   launching their own big sports
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.280]   network. Apparently, Old
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.040]   Division is going to be the
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.480]   editor. So if you go to Twitter
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:20.280]   dot com slash Twitter media,
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.560]   this is the first of them. As
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.280]   you can see, I'm not following
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.440]   them, but almost a million people
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.080]   are tracking cool, meaningful
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.840]   uses of tweets in media TV
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.040]   sports entertainment journalism.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.200]   I would guess this is for you
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.520]   guys, for the journalists for
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.240]   press Facebook does this as well.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.480]   They actually hired a Vadim
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.440]   LaVrusic from Mashable to to
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.920]   run their media curation
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.760]   vertical. And then so you'll know
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.160]   who the big stars are when they
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.760]   join and Twitter's not launching
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.000]   like an ESPN. They're not doing
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:56.920]   sports. They're just going to have
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.840]   another one of these, but it'll be
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.800]   for Twitter sports seems that way.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.120]   And that makes sense. Just a tip
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.960]   out there for people. According
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.520]   to control Steve, I get around
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.920]   the New York Times paywall by
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.080]   using private browsing on IE
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.600]   nine. Sure, because I would never
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.120]   save. I imagine that would work
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.080]   on any of the browsers. Yeah, no
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.200]   cookies. No cookies.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:19.880]   I think the time to really care
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.280]   because they're going to get most
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.960]   people get sucked into it.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.720]   I actually subscribe.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.560]   Now, like, I like, yeah, no, I'm
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.040]   going to pay. I want to support.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.640]   I want to support God knows we
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.920]   steal enough stories from Nick and
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.720]   the gang. Exactly. If I
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.360]   worked for a company where we
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.040]   were charging for news, I'd
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.160]   want you guys. So you're you're
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.400]   smart, though. You're working in
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.680]   the ad supported media.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.760]   That's a good way to go.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.080]   Yeah, but I think we can talk
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:48.840]   about this another time. I think
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.880]   there's different types of ways
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.240]   to leverage paid content,
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.640]   probably at lots of different
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.360]   media outlets. Sure. Sure.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.960]   Dig.com 15 engineering
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.760]   employees gone to the Washington
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.120]   Post. I think that's the you can
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.840]   dig the grave for dig.com.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.120]   A year ago, though. Well, but
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.520]   yeah, but if you're there are
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.320]   all engineering to your entire
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.320]   entire sales and your kind of
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.800]   this kind of done. What happened
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.400]   to dig? How come they never sold
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.560]   in there? It was a phenomenon
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.680]   for a while. It was a phenomenon.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.520]   I think it's interesting that
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.600]   Kevin's all three of Kevin's
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.240]   companies have all kind of fall
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.560]   folded in the month spirit of a
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.600]   month. And now you're working
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.880]   for Google. I think it's word
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.000]   that he's working for Google.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.600]   Yeah, he had to take a job
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.240]   well, you know, I'm wondering
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.640]   and he won't tell me I've asked
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.480]   him and he says, you know, they
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.560]   won't let me tell you what as
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.720]   soon as I can. I'll come on.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.000]   But I think we're talking about
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.560]   Kevin Rose, who, of course, was
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:40.440]   a regular on the show until it
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.280]   became too big for his.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.760]   Is he not allowed to come back
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.040]   anymore? Think about it. Google
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.280]   No, he can. Oh, cool. Well,
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.400]   that's a good question, actually.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.720]   I don't know. He probably won't
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.000]   date the Googlers. I haven't
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.200]   invited him because he said
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:51.520]   already I can't talk about
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.720]   anything going on Google. Not
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.840]   really entertaining to have some
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.760]   guys. I can't say it can say.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.320]   But once but we certainly will
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.800]   have him on as soon as he
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.920]   can. But what's interesting is
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.880]   that this new Google Plus app
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.440]   that came out on the iPhone is
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.640]   very beautiful. It's the first
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.200]   it's the first really good looking
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.760]   mobile app, maybe currents, but
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.520]   it's even better. I mean, it's
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.800]   really beautiful from Google.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:17.120]   And I'm wondering how much that
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.240]   has to do with milk and Kevin
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.560]   and Daniel Birkin. They just went
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.600]   over there, right? Yeah, but
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.520]   that's the thing. It happened so
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.880]   fast. I don't know. We'll never
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.520]   we will find out when he can
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.200]   talk to us. We'll have Kevin
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.320]   Rosen, Adam Curion. Okay, be
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.000]   exciting. It would make sense
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.760]   for for that team to be working
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.800]   on Google Plus, right? I mean,
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.400]   they're all about social.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:39.480]   Yeah, I bet you that's what it
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.320]   is. Right. And I think apps
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.560]   right? They know about apps.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.560]   Yeah. So dig. I don't know what
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.760]   happened with dig. It's it's
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.200]   really interesting. But basically
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.280]   the with the engineering staff
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280]   gone. I mean, Matt Williams
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.760]   hasn't yet said, you know, we're
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.960]   closing our doors, but I don't
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.040]   know what else. I mean, what are
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.160]   they going to do? I mean, at the
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.200]   bottom of that, he said, stay
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.520]   tuned. So maybe they're more
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.840]   news come and keep digging. But
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.640]   what is a strange post is like,
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.040]   we're proud to share that the
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.480]   dig engineering team will be
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.160]   joining the Washington Post.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:12.560]   You know, I mean, you can see
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:15.720]   on the timeline for dig when the
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.960]   collapse started. And it was
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.280]   that that major redesign. Was
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.600]   that when you were crowd surfing
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.960]   that version for that event to
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.360]   an exit? Was that your crowd
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.880]   surfing? Yeah, it's great. It's
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.600]   after that it was later than
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.360]   that. But it was it. I have a
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.160]   shirt that says dig four was my
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.160]   idea. I probably. Yeah. So you
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.680]   did. You did destroy the company.
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.680]   We did now to me. And if anybody
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.000]   wants any other business ideas,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.880]   I'll be glad to share any time.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.080]   Maybe the Washington Post is
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.480]   buying dig. Well, that's the
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.440]   weird thing they didn't. They
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.520]   just had. Yeah, they got their
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.400]   team. It's kind of like why now.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.080]   There must have been some
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.120]   transaction. I don't know.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.760]   All right. One more break. And
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.680]   then we're going to talk about
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.040]   the most pirated show of 2012.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.160]   And here it is. It's only May and
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.120]   we already know. What do you
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.960]   think? Would it be do you think
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.400]   a show that you could get on DVD?
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.280]   Would it be do you think a show
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.720]   you could buy on iTunes or
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.800]   watch Netflix? No, no, it would
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.080]   be a show if you think about it
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.280]   that you couldn't get anywhere.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.000]   That would make sense. There's a
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.120]   hint. There's a new one tonight
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.200]   and there's a new one tonight.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.960]   Girls.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.920]   Sixteen minutes.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.280]   Sixteen minutes.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.040]   Actually like girls. But anyway,
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.160]   that's all girls. Oh, what a
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.240]   horrible show.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.320]   You don't like anything. It's
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.680]   filled with memes. It is. It's
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.960]   the meme show. She said something
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.640]   and we stepped on her. I'm sorry.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.840]   Do you know? I said, yeah, yet
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.840]   again, we disagree because I
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.040]   like the show. Me too. I love
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.040]   it. All women love that show
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.520]   because they're girls. My mom
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.200]   doesn't like it actually. Well,
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.400]   moms would not like it. It is
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.600]   not a mom friendly. Yeah. My
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.040]   mom, I think, is worried about
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.400]   yeah, what her daughter is. What
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.760]   exactly do you do for a living?
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:58.600]   Honey. Yeah. Yeah. Did you call
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.960]   your mom today? I did. I did
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.080]   call my mom today. I did too.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.040]   How about me, Mark? You call
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.960]   your mom? Yeah. So this show is
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.920]   brought to you by gazelle.com.

[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.440]   do. I mean, that's what happens.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.040]   But wouldn't it be nice if you
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.200]   could just say, I'm going to

[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.520]   I'm going to get cash for them
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.560]   and I'm going to move on and get
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.680]   the new gadget. That's what
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.640]   gazelle will do. G A Z E double
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.760]   L E. Dot com Joe and I know you

[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.320]   second. Is it that late already?

[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.880]   old phone. I do. I have a ton.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.880]   Yeah. So here's what happens.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.280]   Now, if you go to gazelle.com
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.280]   now they've they've actually
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:00.800]   streamlined it. They accept a
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.280]   smaller number of products.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.960]   Turns out the products most
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.200]   people wanted to get rid of the
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.920]   iPhone, the iPad, the iPod,
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.920]   Apple TV, Apple laptops, Apple
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.080]   desktops, Apple displays, all
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.200]   the Apple stuff, Blackberries,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.920]   the top Android from some HTC
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.440]   Motorola Samsung LG and
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.040]   Nokia phones. Those were really
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.040]   that's what they were mostly
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.600]   getting. So it makes it much
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.600]   easier because now you say,
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:23.800]   well, I got an iPad. Let me get
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.880]   an offer and you click the offer
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.560]   button. You select your model.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.760]   Let's get. I think this is the
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.800]   iPad to 32 and it's from AT&T
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.760]   335 bucks and that's that's
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.600]   great. And now here's the best
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.000]   part. They'll pay the shipping
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.080]   you throw in a box. They pay the
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.240]   shipping and they send you a
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.600]   check PayPal or if you want an
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.160]   extra 5% choose the Amazon gift
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.400]   card and that's money in the
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:50.920]   bank, baby money in your pocket.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.080]   Gazelle is a great way to move
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.560]   on and get the new gadgets
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.520]   without cluttering your home
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.560]   with the old gadgets. You know
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.240]   what else? Do it now because I
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.200]   can tell you one thing. Those
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.960]   gadgets are not gaining in
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.480]   value every day. That stuff in
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.320]   the closet, that modem is not
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.520]   worth more than it used to be.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.080]   I pretty much I think you can
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.520]   still get money for I SDN
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.080]   modems. If only. Oh, if only.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.360]   Well, I can guarantee you that
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.760]   your MacBook Air is worth money
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.360]   your Apple iPad, your Apple TV.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.000]   This was worth money. Let me
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]   see what you got. Oh, and that's
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.920]   a zoom. You know, they stopped
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.400]   buying zoos for good reason.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.760]   Everybody damn Gazelle. Damn
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.960]   you, Gazelle. Where's the
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.440]   same expect this? They
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.280]   literally they don't. We will
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.560]   no longer accept zoos.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.320]   Oddly enough, the zoom had some
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:45.120]   of the best fidelity. Really?
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.920]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, I love to
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.600]   the zoom. I have my zoom HD
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.520]   still. Yours is the you have the
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.280]   one with the squirkel. Yeah,
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.000]   this was this was mine. Yeah.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.800]   Actually, when I left the
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.320]   verge, I bought Josh to Paul
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.040]   ski as in. Oh, that's a good way
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.040]   to say goodbye. Yeah. It was
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.680]   the guy who's here. You give
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:04.680]   them the finger to him. That's
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.000]   basically the middle finger of
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.160]   tech. Anyway, if you've got
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.200]   everything but a zoom, go to

[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:03.440]   of media. Yeah, it's on HBO hot
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.880]   shot. You have to subscribe to
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.640]   HBO to get has been downloaded
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.280]   more than 25 million times from
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.560]   public torrent trackers since
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.920]   it began early last month.
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.720]   piracy hit a new peak with the
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.240]   April 30th episode, two and a
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.800]   half million downloads a day.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.320]   Wow. I mean, I shouldn't laugh.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.200]   There's a company now that
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.640]   claims that they can you can
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.880]   hire them to block bit
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:28.640]   torrenting. They don't say
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.800]   exactly how they do it. It's a
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.880]   Russian company. They're
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.400]   actually a startup. They just
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.560]   raised a ton of money. But I'm
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.920]   pretty sure what they do is they
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.320]   either put fake torrents out
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.200]   there or more likely they
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.000]   search for toints and they break
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.760]   the chain. And apparently,
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.000]   yeah, a couple of fakes and you
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.120]   get them into the stream and
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.280]   you actually know you got a big
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.320]   empty file. Yeah, that was one
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.320]   of the strategies for taking
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.120]   down Napster and Kazan a lot of
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.280]   those music file sharing.
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.360]   That's exactly right. They
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.880]   hired firms to go in and put a
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.240]   lot of junk files on there. So
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.360]   it was just a terrible
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.400]   experience. No one wanted to
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.520]   use it. They just started using
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.040]   iTunes.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:04.240]   Exactly. And so the already
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.840]   motion pictures have hired,
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.960]   you know, after the hurtlocker
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.960]   experience, there's companies
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.640]   that say proactively we're
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:10.520]   going to hire this Russian
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.920]   company and make sure that we
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.200]   control piracy that way.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:15.320]   Yeah. And then the Russians can
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.960]   have the piracy older themselves.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960]   You know who doesn't have to
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.200]   worry about piracy? I don't
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.960]   think this Ashton Kutcher Steve
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.800]   Jobs movie.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:27.920]   What's the title of it? I think
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.200]   the working title is jobs get
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.600]   inspired. Yeah. Okay, right
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.040]   there. Bad jobs get inspired.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.640]   Wow. He looks a lot like him
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.000]   though. Yeah. Well, you know,
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.320]   from a distance. But when you
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.760]   see close up with the side
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.680]   paper with Andy Inoco mutton
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.640]   chops, the jobs ever have those.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.520]   I don't know. I think so. It's
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.600]   a beard. Oh, I see it goes more.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.640]   You guys just can't see it.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.880]   All right. Maybe they'll just
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.520]   do the whole movie from far away.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:57.640]   Just a wide shot. The whole
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.040]   time. He looks good on the wide
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:00.360]   though. I mean, the jeans, the
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360]   sneaks. He looks like Ashton
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.120]   Kutcher. Come on. Yeah, he does.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.680]   I don't know. It's a dog. It's
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.760]   going to be a dog. It says Sony
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.200]   though is doing the the big
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.320]   feature film based on the
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.320]   Isaacson book. Sony got the
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.760]   rights to that. Okay. Don't know
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:21.800]   when that will be out or who
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.920]   will be paying Steve Jobs. They
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:25.560]   should have it done by JJ Abrams.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:28.360]   They should be some time travel.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.760]   That would be good. This is the
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.680]   Steve Jobs images and strange
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.360]   they can reboot it all. Start
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.960]   all over. Oh, go. I was he found
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.960]   his. He took a dump somewhere.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.040]   Yeah. No, he didn't. Joanna
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.080]   Stern ABC. Go to ABC news.com.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.600]   Watch her on TV. It's so great
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.760]   to have you. Thank you for being
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.360]   here. Thank you for having me
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.560]   again. I really appreciate it.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.840]   We just we think the world of
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.320]   you next time you're in the
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.400]   Bay Area. Come here. Oh, I'm
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.320]   going to be there next month.
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.000]   Bring your zoom. I'm going to
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.240]   bring my zoom. You figure out how
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.000]   I can sell this. I know how you
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.160]   could sell. I'll buy it. You
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.160]   put it. He's got a museum. It's
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.080]   actually. Yeah. No, I'm not
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.040]   going. I don't think I really
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.280]   can sell it. You're going to
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.560]   keep it, aren't you? I need it
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.640]   for times like this, where I
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.040]   need to impress people. It's
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.040]   not going to be a great thing.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.040]   It's not going to be a great
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.040]   thing. It's not going to be a
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.040]   great thing. It's not going to
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:15.040]   be a great thing. It's not going
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.040]   to be a great thing. It's not
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:17.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:37.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:44.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.040]   going to be a great thing. It's
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.040]   going to be iPhones and Mac
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   laptops and Apple's not paying
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.040]   for any of it. You'll see these
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.040]   in all these movies. I'll give
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.040]   you an example. Gossip. I
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.040]   love the lead of that. Gossip
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.040]   girl, right? Isn't that a great
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.040]   lead? Yeah, because you notice
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.040]   it. Well, I watch Gossip Girl
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.040]   all the time. So I guess I
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.040]   notice it, but you really notice
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.040]   it in Gossip Girl. Never
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.040]   looks at Apple products. It
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040]   looks wrong because Verizon had
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040]   a deal with them and all the
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.040]   phones were like droids. Yeah,
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040]   I know the best part was when
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.040]   the Ken was on Gossip Girl.
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:28.040]   The Ken. Well, the Ken. Like anybody
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.040]   uses that. So they didn't sell
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.040]   it to anybody. So this year on
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.040]   the Gossip Girl, the Verizon
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.040]   deal lapsed and all of a sudden
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.040]   it's iPhones everywhere. You
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.040]   know, all the actors were like,
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.040]   yes, we can finally. I hate
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.040]   you. They don't have to act like
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.040]   I love this thing. The company's
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.040]   gadgets were discussed to show
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.040]   891 times on TV in 2011. So
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.040]   some of that pay for, but not a
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.040]   lot of it not because I think
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.040]   there's just basically Hollywood
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.040]   loves. Oh, they pretty much
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.040]   don't pay for anything. I think
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:58.040]   the one of the only ones that
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:59.040]   they paid for was the first
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.040]   mission impossible. Right? When,
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.040]   you know, no one was using Apple
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.040]   at the time and they were trying
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:06.040]   to make a big comeback. Right.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.040]   But yeah, Hollywood just loves.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.040]   You don't have to. So the
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.040]   products end up in these movies
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.040]   as a default. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.040]   Thank you, Mark, for being here.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.040]   We appreciate it. Always good to
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.040]   see you. Yeah. Thank you.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.040]   Yeah. Thanks also to John C.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.040]   Devorak and his plaid shirt.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.040]   He's a channeled devorak.com, my
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.040]   friends. Yeah, there's links to
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.040]   all the other stuff. You know,
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.040]   like Noah gender show.com and
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.040]   PC mag, Marker watch. D H and
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:35.040]   plugged. Now, before we wrap,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.040]   let's find out what's coming up
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.040]   because it's going to be a big
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.040]   week, John. Here's the stories
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.040]   we'll be talking about next week
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.040]   on Twitter, Tom Merritt.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.040]   Hey, thanks, Leo. Here's a few
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.040]   things we'll be keeping an eye on
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.040]   in the week ahead. Tuesday, May
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.040]   15th. Oh, I just let you know
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040]   I'm going to be sick. Also,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.040]   totally unconnected Diablo three
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.040]   is right. Friday, May 18th,
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.040]   the Evo 4G LTE comes out on
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.040]   Sprint for $200 and also on
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.040]   Sprint, the tri-fi hotspot with
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.040]   LTE, Y Max and 3G all in one
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.040]   little hockey puck and/or
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.040]   anvil, depending on how you
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.040]   look at it. Saturday, May 19th,
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.040]   the hackathon kicks off on the
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.040]   weekend leading up to TechCrunch
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.040]   Disrupt. That's a look at the
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.040]   week ahead. Back to you, Leo.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.040]   You have that phone, Joanna.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.040]   You like it? Yeah. I was just
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.040]   about to say that phone is great.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.040]   It's basically a one in HTC
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.040]   one with a kickstand.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.040]   Look at the stand.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.040]   That makes it an Evo. They put
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.040]   a kickstand in and it's now it's
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.040]   an Evo. Yeah.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.040]   It's actually a little bit thinner
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   than I think the one ax on 18D.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.040]   It's just nice. I think this is
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.040]   you said before the show began and
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.040]   I agree and I think you do agree
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.040]   Eileen and so that this is the
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.040]   best Android phone out there
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.040]   but I bet you it's going to be
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.040]   better than that. I mean this is
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:49.040]   better than the last three.
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.040]   I also found this old Metro PCS
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.040]   smartphone. Ooh, look at that.
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.040]   So this could still be the best
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040]   Android smartphone. This is Eileen
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.040]   Rivera's very last twit with us.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.040]   She's moving on. Round of applause.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.040]   Yeah. She's our producer, has been
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.040]   blessed a year and a half. Really
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.040]   a great producer, wonderful person.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.040]   So nice to have her here every
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.040]   Sunday when we come in and the
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:13.040]   first time we're going to survive
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.040]   next week's tune in for the most
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.040]   disorganized Twitter ever.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:19.040]   It'll probably be the best.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.040]   It's been an honor. Eileen is
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.040]   going on to work for Molly Wood
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.040]   actually on CBS. She's going to
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.040]   produce Molly's new show always on.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.040]   So I can't wait. When does that
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.040]   launch? You know? Mid June, I
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.040]   believe. Let's get Eileen and
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.040]   Molly in to talk about the show when
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.040]   it's coming out. Eileen will still
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.040]   be around the Brickhouse though
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.040]   because she's a host of all about
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.040]   the show.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.040]   It's about four o'clock. Five
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.040]   five o'clock Pacific eight pm
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.040]   Eastern. Thank you. It's been
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.040]   amazing. This is amazing. I
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.040]   can't even say it anymore. We're
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.040]   going to miss you. We really
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.040]   appreciate your being here. And
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.040]   thank you all for being here. We
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.040]   do this show every Sunday three

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.040]   you miss it, don't worry. You

[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:10.040]   show. Thank you all for being here.
