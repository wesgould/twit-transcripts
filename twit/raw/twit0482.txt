[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   The show that covers the techs news of the week with the top tech reporters in the field.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.760]   One of the reasons I love doing this show is because this is how I learn what it all
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   means.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.000]   We bring in really smart people and they explain to me.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Let's say hi to Chris Breen.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.720]   Haven't seen him in ages from Macworld.com.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.200]   One of the few remaining Macworld.com employees.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.360]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   It's quality.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   It's for the quality.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   They kept Mac9111.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.760]   You were already working on the website.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.000]   We've been doing web first for a really, really, really long time.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.560]   It's the nature of the print business.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.080]   The print magazines just aren't happening anymore.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.160]   They killed that and not unexpectedly.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.600]   PCworld went down last year.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.120]   It was our turn.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.520]   We carry on and we're going to do what we can.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.280]   You asked me when we started talking about this before the show.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.520]   When's the last time you wrote a book?
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   It's true.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   People like Paul Therad, who continue to write books, I'm not sure why.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   I'm not sure who's buying print books.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   You write a book.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.440]   You don't have to have it be printed.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.120]   No, in fact, nowadays a lot of what he does is online.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.800]   Hey, that's Ralph Needleman.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.040]   This is a reunion of sort of all three of us.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.760]   I've had you on an age since you were back at CNET.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.160]   Went to Evernote for a while and now you're editorial director at Yahoo's Tech.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   Yahoo Tech.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   I'm working with David Pogue.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   Tech Tech Star.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   It's Katie Kirk.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   Stop by once in a while.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160]   Say hi.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   Talk to her.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.640]   It's really, really, really awesome to work with a company that can get star power like
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   that.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   It's kind of cool.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   It's really neat.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   I've had a great time.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   You ever see Marissa?
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   Yeah, of course.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.280]   It says, "How's it going, Ralph?"
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   All the time.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   I'll wait chat.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.160]   I actually have a real soft spot in my heart for Yahoo.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   I think all of those of us who are old timers and my Yahoo was my start page for a long
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.920]   time on the internet.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.280]   Yahoo was my first search engine.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.360]   You never forget your first search engine.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.800]   You never forget your first search engine.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.760]   So I sometimes feel like some people in Tech Press and the public are rooting against
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   Yahoo.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   I've always been rooting for it.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   They do well.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.720]   The interesting thing about Yahoo is that outside of the tech bubble where it's your
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   king.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   It's everything.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.080]   And tech bubble people don't know about things like OMG, which is a huge property.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.480]   It's the gossip channel, TV.com.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.280]   These are very big content properties that you're right.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.600]   I think normal people know about.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.280]   But they're kind of, it's not the cool new thing anymore.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.160]   The interesting thing about working for Yahoo and for the Yahoo audience, I've never worked
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.760]   for this mainstream audience before.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.600]   It is so hard.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   Yes.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.440]   And it's, I mean, to write in a way that is both accurate and approachable for everybody.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440]   Challenging.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   Oh my god.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   But it's really good.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   I like it.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.040]   That's why I keep, one of the reasons I keep doing the radio shows because it keeps you
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.800]   in touch with what normal people are worried about as opposed to what we in the tech bubble
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   are worried about.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   But this show is a tech bubble show.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   And I don't mind saying this show is fine for the guests because it saves us a lot of
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   time.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   Well, the internet, see, is this interconnection of computers all over the world.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   We don't have to say that.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.760]   We can assume, take it as written that you all know what.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.640]   So I guess, what is the big story?
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.240]   There were a lot of big stories this week.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.240]   I do apologize.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.840]   We had booked Cara Swisher for this show.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.400]   I really wanted to get her on this week.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.240]   And unfortunately, her schedule changed.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.480]   She had a fly out of town.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.000]   So we didn't have her on.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.880]   But I was going to ask her about the Kim Kardashian interview at Recode, which I thought was interesting.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.840]   And then she wrote an article and I wasn't going to cover this story without her here.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.400]   But I'm just going to mention it.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.440]   But I don't think it's a tech story for us.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.760]   I think it's a story, more of a social story, but Tim Cook coming out.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.640]   And I wasn't going to actually really talk about it because it doesn't have any to do
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   with technology.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.280]   But she wrote, and I think she's right.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.920]   And has a lot to do with somebody in a huge position of power, a very public person, coming
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:37.000]   out is a really great signal to young gay men and women who might be worried about how
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.520]   the world's going to receive them.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.920]   And they're saying, here's a guy who is running the most valuable company in the world.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.000]   And he says, I'm glad he says a gift from God.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Cara wrote a good article about it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.240]   I was going to ask her about it.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240]   But yeah, there it is.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   It's good for him.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   Yeah, good for him.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.480]   And she says, it's the Tim Cook moment.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.600]   But that's all we'll do because we want to talk about actual technologies as opposed
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   to the gossipy social thing, although not that I'm against gossip.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.520]   All right, this isn't that Tim Cook coming out isn't gossip.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.920]   It is like a huge, it's just a huge step forward for humanity if you ask me.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   I agree.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.960]   Well, and I also think it humanizes Apple more.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.480]   And I think that's something Tim's been doing since he's come in.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.040]   He's gotten the Steve Jobs monkey off his back.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.400]   But that's clear, isn't it?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   Yeah, and they're talking about things like the environment much more than they have before.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.280]   I mean, they always had sort of the green push initiative, but Tim Cook really means
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.000]   it and talking about social issues, trying to do something about labor issues in China.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.360]   And I think this is where he kind of steps up and he walks the walk and says, and in
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.920]   addition to that, this is who I am, he humanizes himself, he humanizes the company.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:55.160]   And I think he kind of puts this whole CEO as superhero, but with a touch of evil in them
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.560]   behind us a little bit.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.160]   He's coming out of the mountain is where he's coming out.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.200]   He's not in his seat in his evil lair anymore.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.880]   Yeah, but I, and you know, there's, there was that trend of sort of the the Ellison's
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.960]   and the bombers and Steve Jobs and the CEOs that were brilliant, but you know, sort of
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.000]   people you wouldn't want to meet on the street because they'd kill you.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.400]   And where I think with Tim Cook, he's more of the kind of a guy who has a real life.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.720]   And you say, yeah, this, this is an individual who's willing to talk about himself and not
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.960]   be that guy as tough as he may be in business, but to actually show that he's a human being.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.000]   He's talking here at the Wall Street Journal conference about retailers.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.840]   This is a big story this week about, and last week too, about retailers like CVS and
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.960]   Rite Aid that are in the MCX group and aren't doing, or you're going to do currency.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.200]   He talks a little bit about that here in this, can you get my audio or no?
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.760]   We've been at it for a week.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.880]   And I, I followed these numbers pretty closely in the first 72 hours, we'd gone over the
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.800]   one million mark on activations of cards.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.360]   And Visa and MasterCard, we talked to these guys today and they told us that if you sum
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.840]   up everyone else that's in the contactless mobile payment at the point of sale, we're
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.160]   already number one.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.960]   And not just number one, but we're more than the total of all the other guys.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.840]   And that's, we've only been at it a week.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.480]   And so I feel fantastic.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.040]   I think it's great.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.280]   Now we've got a lot more to go.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.640]   We've got a lot of merchants to sign up.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.720]   We've got a lot more banks to sign up.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.960]   And we have the whole rest of the world.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.040]   We're only in the US right now.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.920]   And so we're just getting started.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.880]   But the early ramp looks fantastic.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.480]   And I'm getting flooded with emails from customers that are just, you know, it's sort
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.200]   of that, ah, moment.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.160]   You use the phone and that's all you have to do.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.720]   Now this is all sale stuff.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.600]   And it's unbelievable.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.480]   You're no longer fishing for the credit card, you know, we're going to cut this out.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.840]   But can we cut right to the part?
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.120]   It's not that long a sound.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.680]   And last year.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:19.320]   And so I think it's the first and only mobile payment system that's both easy, private,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   and secure.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.960]   So I think we hit on all three key points.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.240]   I don't think he talks about the customer cares about it.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   Is that the beginning?
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.480]   He just, this is, he's well, he's well spoken.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.400]   He's very good at making you really turn it into a sales tax by the end.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   Yes.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   All right.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   Well, I wanted to have him talk about currency and why he's not worried about it.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   I'll tell you a good reason why he's not worried about it.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.960]   Currency has already been hacked.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.480]   So that's a bad start for a system that is ridiculous is not available.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.320]   Number one is ridiculously complicated.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   You have to take a pick.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   You have to have the app.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.760]   You have to take a picture of a QR code.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.480]   You have to then show that QR code to the camera on the other side to register it back
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.880]   to the, it's really, it's nuts.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.720]   And it doesn't hook into the credit card system.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.360]   Well, and that's the point of it, right?
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   Right.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.440]   So they don't have to give any money to the credit card system and they can keep all
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   the information.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   Right.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.720]   So I've got to give some new system access to my checking account.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   Right.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   Thank you very much.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   Right.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.160]   And you're so fairly, they ask for your social, they ask for your home, they know your home
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.640]   address, they know all sorts of stuff.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.840]   And so it is cause for concern.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.640]   You know, the currency folks said, Oh no, we're secure.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.200]   Customer email addresses were hacked.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.600]   Now currency says, well, wasn't was it was hacked.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.720]   It was a third party that was using the, had the email addresses.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.800]   Well, that doesn't make me feel better.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.280]   We did a story on how to punish stores that don't, that have turned off Apple Pay if you're
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   really mad at them.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   Just a silly thing.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   Do you think people are going to do that?
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   Punish them.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.240]   And the way you punish them is to use a credit card with the highest possible charge.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   America Express.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   Right.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   Let's use your amex from now on at all.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   Right.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240]   Right.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   Right.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240]   Right.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   Well, I don't, will people's, I think people are going to be pissed because I don't think
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.560]   it's a non starter.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   Well, currency.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.800]   It's just insane because I mean, not to sound like a fanboy, but I'm already bored by Apple
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.320]   Pay because it is just so unbelievably easy.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.520]   It actually works.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.080]   It's so such a non event to use it.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   Right.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.960]   So, Kristen, did you say that?
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.120]   I think somebody, yeah, I think it's a really great system.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.920]   The take I have on this story is that Apple Pay is great for us as consumers.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.320]   It's great for credit card companies because they're going to make more money because people
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.800]   can use the thing more.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.640]   It's good for the banks, but it's not so good for the retailers because they're trying
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   to get out from under credit cards.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.200]   Kind of like, you understand why they're doing this, but you're right.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.560]   It's a terrible implementation.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.120]   It's consumer hostile.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.400]   And so I think it is kind of a non starter where people are going to go in and just say,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.920]   you know, I'll go to Walgreens instead because they're going to accept Apple Pay and you
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.200]   are not.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.680]   And I think that's too bad because I would like to see the retailers get something out
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.880]   of this, but it's not going to be that way.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.880]   It's going to have to be some other method where they're going to get a break somehow
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.360]   on credit card payments or something.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.640]   I mean, so that they want to be part of it.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   It is ironic.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.400]   I almost wonder maybe if they've been targeted by disgruntled Apple Pay lovers because they
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.560]   aren't even public.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.640]   They're still in a pilot program and they had to send it on an email to their pilot
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.960]   user saying an unauthorized third party had obtained email addresses.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.400]   They said, don't worry.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   A lot of the addresses are dummy accounts used for testing purposes.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.960]   That's not a reassurance.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.280]   If you're not a dummy account, the currency itself was not affected.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.600]   So don't worry.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.080]   And yes, we take their security very seriously.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.640]   We're not a good at it, but we take seriously.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.040]   And there are just dummies who are using the dummy accounts.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   Dummy accounts.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   Okay.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.040]   Please.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   Some of you were dummies.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.080]   I think this is an example of just one.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.760]   This is the nail in the coffin.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.280]   This is like you couldn't get much worse than that.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.880]   By the time it rolls out, if it ever rolls out, this will have been forgotten.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.360]   But by then, Apple Pay will be, people will be so accustomed to using it at Whole Foods
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.960]   and Walgreens that they'll go to a store and they don't have Apple Pay and I have to
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.040]   use this other system that wants my socials like no thanks.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   Right.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   So it's dumb.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.920]   Very, very, if you make a customer happy because a transaction is easy, they will come back
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.200]   and buy more stuff.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.160]   If the transaction has a lot of friction, you're going to lose money.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.360]   But you could still use cash in a credit card at any one of these stores, right?
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.360]   So yeah.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.760]   If Walgreens is right there, maybe you'll use Walgreens.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.960]   But if it's another mile down the road, it just seems to me people are going to do what's
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   convenient.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.360]   I don't think Apple Pay by itself.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   Maybe it does.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.920]   Does it make you want to shop somewhere?
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   Because they have Apple Pay.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   Which does because I'm a nerd.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.720]   But I think it's, Apple Pay has been out now what for a month?
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   Not even that.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   Less?
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   Two weeks.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   Okay.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.360]   Two weeks and it's already boring and reliable.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.000]   And it's only just come out.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.320]   But what is left that Apple can do?
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.760]   You think this is it, that Apple is just going to roll out Apple Pay and that's it?
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   Where are the coupons?
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.280]   Where are the loyalty programs?
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.120]   Where are all the little things you do with plastic cards that you can now going to be
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.440]   able to do with Apple Pay?
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.480]   This is just the beginning of how Apple is going to make retail better or try to anyway.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.960]   And as I think it was Philip Elmer to whit last week pointed out onto it, one benefit
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.400]   of Apple Pay is the lines move faster.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.960]   And that would get me to go somewhere.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.720]   If I knew that the line was twice as fast at Walgreens, I might go across the street
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.880]   just because I could get out faster.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.840]   That's a benefit.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.640]   I think we mentioned, I don't know if we mentioned this last week, they are talking
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.480]   with China about Ali Pay.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.280]   Ali Baba has its own Pay solution.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.880]   And if they put Ali Pay in China, I mean, Apple Pay in China through Ali Pay, that's
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.040]   a huge deal.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   And open is it up world?
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   Well, very big.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.680]   I feel like we've done, I'm trying to remember if we've done some of these last week.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.480]   Well, yeah, I mean, this, the whole getting into China thing is huge to the point where,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.760]   you know, you think of Apple as being a technology company and there's so many lots of iPhones.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.560]   But, and I've been talking about the iPhone as money forever.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.120]   And I think a lot of us have.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.560]   And now that it is and think of what, because they get what point 0 to 5% or something per
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.640]   transaction, and I, or maybe it's 0.25%.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.840]   That turns out if in the US alone, we spend $2 trillion on credit card purchases.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.480]   So if all that was going to Apple Pay, that would be $3 billion a year in transactions.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.800]   And remember, that doesn't come out of your pocket directly.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.480]   It comes from the credit card transaction.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.000]   It comes from the credit card company.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.040]   So now expand that to worldwide and say, okay, well, that's ridiculous.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.520]   Of course, Apple's not going to get all that.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.760]   Let's say they get a third of that over time.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.560]   It's still an enormous amount of money.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.000]   And in using a system that people are encouraged to buy with.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.560]   Where first, I mean, I think when Tim was talking in the sales pitch about, we already
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560]   have a million people.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.440]   Well, of course they do because they sold a ton of iPhone 6s and people were interested
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.560]   in the novelty of it.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   So sure people signed up in droves.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.000]   But I think as more people see that in action and we have more and more devices that do
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.160]   that, they're going to get more people thinking of, you know, not only because of the security
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.240]   problems with their credit cards.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.600]   Like I just had to renew my credit card for a third time in the last two years.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.160]   But Apple's selling privacy is a feature now.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.920]   And so the ability to be able to have a unique transaction with every Apple Pay purchase
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.880]   is enormously powerful.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.000]   So you can put that kind of stuff behind you, be encouraged to use it more.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.800]   And then again, on the other side, you've got the merchant saying, well, no use this.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   It's less secure.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   We need more information from you.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.320]   And you want that?
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   No.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.120]   Because you're not going to, they're not going to kick back the money they're saving for
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   the credit card.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   It's not like you get it.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   Right.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   And that could be a feature for them.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.280]   If they make this less intrusive and say, look, we're not paying credit card fees anymore.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.000]   So we're going to give you that 2% or that 3%.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.280]   Maybe that's attractive, but they got, they have to scale down the onerousness of the other
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.840]   stuff first.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   Here's the quote.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.280]   When asked about CVS and Rite Aid Cook said it's a skirmish over the long arc of time.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.600]   Retailers will step back and say, no other system is more secure.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.920]   I think that's been demonstrated now.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   You're only relevant.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.480]   Now, I don't know if I agree with this, but what do you think?
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   You're only relevant as a retailer if your customers love you.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.920]   See, tell that to Comcast.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.360]   I don't think I love CVS or Walgreens.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.960]   It's just where I go to get my, you know, my eyedrops.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   I don't.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   Apple.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.160]   I mean, Apple is loved.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.840]   Apple can say that, you know, that works for us.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   Right.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:09.920]   Well, they, Apple wants other companies to treat their customers the same way that customers
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   feel about app.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   Right.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.080]   Hey, if you can get them to love you, more power to it.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.760]   He also explained why they killed the iPod classic.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   We couldn't get the parts.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.360]   I wonder which part that was.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.040]   Was it the hard drive?
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   Was it some circuit?
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   Circuit board.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.440]   So that hard drive is a, is it somebody told me it's a Toshiba hard drive, right?
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440]   It's a tiny little hard drive.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.240]   I remember when I first came out with them, they were compact flash sized.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.360]   And I think I don't remember how big they were, but they were they're spinning.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.440]   They're literally in the 160 gig iPod classic, a spinning hard drive.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   Right.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   Old fashioned.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.960]   I bet you I'm thinking they don't make those anymore.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   That's what I'm guessing.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.520]   I think they had about the shelves for as long as they could, because I thought they'd killed
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.520]   the thing a couple of years ago and they didn't.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.680]   I wrote the obit for three years ago.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   Right.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.200]   I'm going to, and finally I got to dust it off and you know, update the dates on it and
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.960]   then it was out right away.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.040]   But I think, I think right, you know, they stocked them as long as they could and they
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.000]   finally got to the point where they say, well, okay, we finally cleared them out.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.240]   People have them love the things because of the capacity.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   I bought one.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.800]   Because I, just like you, I figured this is it a year ago and I bought one because I
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   keep it in my car.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.040]   That's my music system car.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.280]   I could just see that guy.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.640]   There's some guy who had, they have a shelves of Toshiba's and his, he gets the last one.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.280]   He blows off the dust.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.120]   They put it in iPod and that's it.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   We're out.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   We're done.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   We're done.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   Close the line.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.400]   It's a, is this it?
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:47.280]   The, yeah, this is the Toshiba MK1626 GCB.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   It is the sixth generation iPod classic 160 giga hard drive.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   I bet you Toshiba just stopped making them.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.280]   Well, why?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.160]   Because they're, besides the iPod, they're not going to be, I mean, 160 gigabytes of
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   storage, eventually the flash ram or flash storage will be less, less, less, right, faster
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   and more reliable.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   That's right.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.040]   Now you could put a flash drive in an iPod classic, but you might, then you might as
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.800]   well make it a touch with, I mean, right now, can you get a touch with 128 gigs?
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.560]   You can get an iPhone with 128 gigs.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   That's a good question.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   Get close.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560]   That's a good question.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   I don't think they've updated then.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560]   I think it's still a 64.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.400]   And also, there's still a stop iPod button at the Apple store.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.080]   I'm amazed.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.840]   And then right underneath it beats by Dre.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.440]   I don't know how many of these they're selling.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.600]   No, 64 gigs is the largest iPod touch.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.440]   Well, if they wanted to, they can make it 128.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.560]   Are we moving it away from all this local storage anyway?
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.360]   We're moving towards streaming and I feel like I don't need to have as much storage
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.440]   as I thought, as I used to think I needed.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.560]   You have a story about that, which is that, you know, for the first time, Apple's revenue
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.760]   on purchased music is going down.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.160]   Yeah, that's a huge.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.080]   So you think it's connected to that?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   The fact that...
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   That makes sense.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.720]   They dropped 13% in 2014, which isn't even over yet.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.920]   13% in revenues on iTunes music.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.760]   Because people are moving to streaming.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   That's my belief.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   I bet you're right.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.080]   I mean, I'd rather pay, I'd pay what, $10 a month for Spotify.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.560]   It's $120 a year.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.600]   I get all the music I want.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.080]   I've got reliable enough cell coverage in the car.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.720]   So I can stream whatever I want.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.600]   I want to have something on the airplane when I'm not connected.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   I download it.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   Done.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.840]   I don't need to buy music anymore.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.720]   And remember, iTunes is the number one music retailer.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.880]   The RIAA reported in the US sales of digital singles fell 11% in the first six months.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.720]   Sales of albums fell 14% in the first six months.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.280]   So it's across the board.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.720]   Meanwhile, music service revenue jumped 28% in the first six months.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.160]   But of course, now Chris, you're a musician.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.680]   You're a working musician.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.600]   I have to think this is bad for musicians.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.120]   Yeah, streaming is not good for musicians.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.840]   You get no money from spot.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.440]   So yeah, we've seen the stories.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.520]   I mean, there was the Lady Gaga story about a couple of years ago where people streamed
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.120]   8 trillion spins of something of hers.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.280]   And she made like $1.48.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.920]   I mean, it was just ridiculous.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   That's terrible.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   Little money.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   But it is the way it's.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.640]   I mean, I look at my daughter who's 13.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.200]   She hasn't purchased music ever because we have streaming and we always have had it for
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   years.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   But I look at my kids.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   No, no, no.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.680]   You tell me because you both have kids who are younger.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.920]   They don't even really stream music.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.400]   They watch YouTube.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.640]   You know, I guess they stream when they're in the car.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.320]   No, actually Abby wants downloads, but she's 22.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.840]   See, she's of a different generation already.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.440]   But I do notice most music, Chris, you're 16, right?
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   17.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.200]   I download but my sister who's a little bit younger than me, she looks at all our music
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.880]   on YouTube and I listen to a lot of you.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.640]   YouTube is a very big source of music.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.040]   In fact, I think that's another story that Google, I think, is going to start making
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   money on YouTube music.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.480]   They keep saying they're going to do that.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.840]   They're going to sell that as a subscription.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   Makes sense.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   All right.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.360]   Apple, everybody's going, hey, you talk about Apple all the time.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.640]   Okay, we're going to talk about Google.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.520]   We're going to talk about Microsoft.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.120]   We're going to talk about Twitter.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   You know what?
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   We're going to even talk about hardware.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   We're going to talk about HP.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.240]   When's the last time we talked about HP?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.320]   There's something to say about HP.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.120]   But let me talk first about Citrix.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:37.080]   Go to meeting the place to go if you have, as most of us do, clients or colleagues who
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.320]   are not in the same building with you.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.160]   They're not maybe even the same town.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.840]   They may not even be in the same country.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.480]   Nowadays, everybody is spread out all over the place.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.880]   The last thing you want to do is spend time in an airplane traveling to meet with coworkers
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.680]   or new prospects.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.400]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could present that sales picture?
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.640]   Work together online.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.120]   You can with Citrix go to meeting.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.360]   You never even have to leave your desk.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.040]   In fact, you might never even have to leave your backyard because you can use an iPad or
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.160]   a mobile device to join a meeting.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.600]   You could present from the iPad.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   You'll save time.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.960]   You'll get more done and you'll even see each other face to face.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.160]   You don't even give that up.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.440]   Go to meeting now has really nice HD video conferencing built in.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.760]   So you share screens so you can collaborate on documents.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.040]   You can see each other face to face.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.760]   It's a very easy way to schedule meetings.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.840]   They have a simple way to do it and outlook.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.880]   You just send out a meeting invitation, but you don't have to do that.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.120]   You can so easy to start a meeting.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.560]   You can press a button and say, "Okay, let's meet right now."
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.120]   It's simple.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.640]   Unless you pay once and meet as many times as you want for as long as you want.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640]   Each month I love it.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   Go to meeting.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   We use it.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   I want you to try it.

[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   Ralph Needleman is here.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.760]   He's editorial director at the Yahoo Tech site, tech.yahoo.com.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   Great to have you.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   He's at R-A-F-E on the Twitter.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.800]   You're spreing my old buddy from Macworld Magazine.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   He's still there.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   Macworld.com.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.560]   He does the Mac 911 column.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   Keeps us all using our Mac.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.480]   Macs are back.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   I feel like.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   Macs are back.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   We write about all the stuff.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.560]   The iOS stuff, the Apple TV stuff, the Mac stuff.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.760]   Yeah, but Macs are doing quite well.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.960]   Just got the 5K iMac.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.640]   I reviewed it and now I have it at home because I bought it.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.440]   How do you like it?
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.440]   You bought it?
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.960]   It's kind of, well, so okay, I made the mistake of buying a Mac Pro.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.960]   The little beautiful.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.960]   The trash can.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   Trash can.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   Thanks.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.760]   Makes me feel even better about it.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.360]   And I've been using it and I bought a, I spent a lot of money on this because not only
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.400]   did I get that but then you have to get external storage.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   So I got a little bit, little big drive and then I had to get a 4K monitor because,
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.920]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.240]   So at the end of the line, I don't know.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.520]   I've spent a ton of money and it's not as fast and it doesn't look as good as the 5K
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.320]   iMac and it's twice as much or more.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   Kills me.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.360]   In fact, it depends what you do with it.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.040]   If you're doing multi-core stuff, it actually is faster.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.120]   Single core, the iMac, yeah.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120]   Has an edge.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.560]   Yeah, we got the i7 top of the line and it's 4 GHz.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.120]   I thought we weren't going to see 4 GHz processors.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.080]   Didn't Intel kind of give up on, well, they can't beat it anyway.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.680]   So it's the fastest single core processor out there.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.600]   You can't get a 5K screen on the Mac Pro because you can't drive it.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.760]   The Thunderbolt's not fast enough.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.440]   Yeah, I don't, I think Apple is a little confused about his Mac Pro strategy right now.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440]   Wow.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.240]   And they haven't even, and they haven't updated the Thunderbolt display.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.680]   That's still the fat, the thin Benazil.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   Right.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:01.000]   So yeah, if you want the ultimate computer for editing video, it's not a pro.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Right.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And that's sad.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.760]   It's not the way God intended things to do.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.040]   God, God had something to do with this.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   All right.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.480]   God and Tim Cook.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.120]   Andy Rubin is leaving Google.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.320]   This, I wonder if this has a little bit to do with last week's story that Sundar Pichai
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.520]   had been promoted now to run most of Google.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.960]   He's Larry Page's number two guy.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.800]   Andy Rubin was brought in when Google bought Android.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   He was the creator of Android.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.120]   He had worked at Danger before that.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   Danger.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   I remember.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   Danger.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.520]   He had the greatest ads with gorillas walking down the street.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   Danger had all the smart guys from Apple like Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.800]   Really interesting guys.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.880]   And I think the sidekick was their first and only product I'm thinking.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.680]   They made a couple of different versions of the sidekick.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   Right.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.160]   They had their really creative flip out screen.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   Loved that.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   That was really neat.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.400]   If you want to look dated, if anybody made a movie with this so funny, for some reason,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.000]   all phones date you faster than neckties, hair, anything lapel size.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.840]   Boy, that would look really dated if you had a sidekick.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   And remember you flipped it up like that and you started typing like that.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.680]   I was always afraid I was going to flip it and it would just keep going.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.880]   I wonder if my sidekick is around somewhere.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   I'd love to find that.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   You don't want work anymore.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.720]   It won't work at all because they killed the server.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   Right.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   Because it was a proxy server.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.080]   So the site terrible idea.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.880]   It was a great idea.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.560]   Well, it sped things up, but every bit of everything you did was stored not on your phone.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   Right.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   But with danger.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   Yes.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560]   That was a good idea.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.360]   Especially when you say it that way.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.480]   It was stored with danger.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.440]   My middle name is danger.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.560]   But it's the only way that networks were so slow then that was the only way you could
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.160]   like get email and browse the web.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.640]   It was a phone for its time.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.840]   Back in the day.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.320]   It's time didn't last very long.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:58.600]   So Andy had been running Android until recently moved on to do what Google calls a moon shot
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   with robots.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.120]   He was always a robot guy that hence the name Android.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.560]   In fact, before he worked at danger, I think he was doing robots.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.480]   Anyway, he's leaving.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.760]   And I wonder if this maybe is the beginning of a little bit of a brain drain for Google
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.360]   who has shown pretty clearly the Sundar Pachai is the guy.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.280]   I'm pretty cynical about moves like this.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:29.000]   But in this particular case, Andy's done a lot for Google.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.200]   He did work for Apple too.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.400]   And he was I think doing his dream job or anybody's dream job at Google.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   He was working on robots.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.040]   And now he's going to spin off and do an independent incubator on robots.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.520]   If I'm not him, but that sounds like a pretty awesome job.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   Right.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.240]   You know, basically doing the Google robot moonshots, but with his and other people's
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.480]   money and more interesting entrepreneurs than even he could find at Google, it sounds pretty
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.400]   cool to me.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.520]   Google says we'll continue with our robot efforts.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.000]   But it's a little bit of a loss to lose like a guy.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.800]   He was the guy who bought those crazy running robots from Boston Dynamics, those scary dog
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   robots.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.960]   Well, the other conspiracy theory on this is that he doesn't want to be part of the
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.080]   military industrial complex.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.160]   And Google has said that they're not going to sell their products to the military, but
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.680]   I mean, Boston Dynamics is a military contract.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.960]   So I don't know how that works out.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.680]   And an analyst at IDC says it sounds it's surprising.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.760]   And sounds here it is.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.840]   That's the wildcat.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.800]   This is the scariest robot ever.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   First of all, it's really noisy.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.600]   Go ahead and turn up the sound.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:52.560]   And then imagine like you're walking on the street and you see this thing.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.120]   That's my worst nightmare right there.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.280]   It's running that for those who are listening, it's, it's running.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.560]   It looks like it's called big dog.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   That one's big dog.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   This is wildcat.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   That's wildcat.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.800]   Big dog is the one that that walks in the woods.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   It looks like a horse.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   Right.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   Which would you rather fight?
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.400]   It's just imagine that charging towards you right now.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.800]   Look how fast it goes.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.360]   That is impressive.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.040]   It doesn't turn very well.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.680]   So it doesn't have to.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.920]   It's to run serpentine and it can't, it will get confused.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.000]   Is that right?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.360]   All I have to do is run faster than Rafe.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   Wow.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.280]   You know, it's like they took all the wrong lessons from the sci-fi books.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   In the 1960s and 70s.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.520]   Like, no, this will be really cool if we have robots that kill people.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.240]   Were we supposed to put it on off switch?
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   Oh, we forgot.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   Oh, gosh.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   And we gave them intelligence.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.160]   Who would have thought that would have a problem?
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.480]   Oh, well, yeah, it did seem kind of sudden.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.840]   That's what IDC's analyst said.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.320]   It seems a little unplanned and a little sudden and perhaps unvoluntary.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   I don't think so.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.720]   I think this is Andy Rubin's decision, but maybe he had a better idea suddenly in the
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   middle than I woke up and said, I'm leaving Google.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.640]   It will be, it will be a loss for their robotics program.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.000]   Lollipop is coming.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.280]   The Google's Nexus phone and Nexus six sold out in, we think 20 seconds.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.680]   So something like that.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.840]   Yeah, it was quick.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.200]   It was painfully fast.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.160]   For those of us trying to buy one, this is the phone.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:35.560]   It's a six inch, almost six inch, 5.95 inch phone with, you know, kind of top of the
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:41.160]   line specs and the first, it would be the first phone to run Android 5.0 Lollipop.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.400]   Google said, we'll put it on sale October 29th.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:51.760]   So Jason and I both got up early that morning, started refreshing the Google store, refresh,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.360]   refresh.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:34:00.920]   They hadn't put it on sale by about, I think 10.30 and I need to be here at 10.30.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.080]   So I left the house at 10.25.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.040]   I got here at 10.30 was sold out.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.800]   You got one.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   I didn't get one.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   Yes.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   I had an elaborate system and somehow I worked.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.560]   I feel like I lucked out more than anything because it was quick.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.840]   You're refreshing the left and then the right and the left and the right.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.840]   Different configurations.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:27.000]   And then the left one suddenly goes from pre-order start soon immediately to out of inventory
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.160]   like Oh crap.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.720]   So then I'm refreshing on the other one like as fast as I can and somehow it worked.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.680]   Did you get the midnight blue or the.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.640]   You got the white 64 gig.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   Good.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.720]   That's the one I would have got.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.360]   So we'll have that when now when is that when are they going to ship that supposedly shipping
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.200]   the 21st of November.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.360]   Although it may be sooner, maybe you know, who knows Google isn't very good at this
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.000]   whole, you know, retail retail thing online.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   So who knows?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.720]   We got to wonder, did they have only 10 of them?
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.920]   Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.640]   Or was there such a man or the fact that it's going to all of the carriers, right?
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   At least here in the US.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   Maybe that's it.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.240]   Maybe they did only have a split.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.200]   Because Verizon T mobile AT&T Sprint and US cellular all are going to have it.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.960]   So maybe I can go there and get it, you think?
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   And possibly if that ends up being the case, you might even be able to go there sooner than
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.640]   I will get it through the pre-order through Google Play.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.120]   Because I think it was expected to be released sooner than this.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   And this wasn't cheap.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.520]   I mean, it wasn't it didn't sell out because it was an inexpensive Nexus phone.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.000]   It was 650 bucks for the one you got?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.320]   The one I got ended up being somewhere around 700.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.120]   Once you get all the taxes?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.760]   Yeah, 750 right around there.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.200]   I mean, not inexpensive.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   This is priced like any other, you know, top of the line phone.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.680]   Well, it is top of the line though.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.520]   It's pretty beautiful phone.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.560]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.680]   I was really looking forward to it.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.960]   What people did with the iPhone, I didn't know that Android nuts are the same dedication.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   Apparently.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.200]   Staying up till the phone's supposed to go on sale, then hitting all the different screens
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   at once.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   It's very much the same.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   Yeah, exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.160]   I don't know what's wrong with me because I also waited in line at the Apple Store for
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   five hours.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.840]   So there's something really wrong with me.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.160]   I was at the Apple Store yesterday to pick something up.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.480]   Did they have them in stock?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.040]   There was a line out the door for iPhones.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   That's bizarre.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.040]   Boy, you'd love to be in that position.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   In a month later.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   It was crazy.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   I didn't get it.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.040]   Unbelievable.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040]   I didn't want to run up to people like that.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   I was like, "You can buy it online.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.720]   You can't go to the door."
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.120]   Well I was at the mall.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:42.680]   I was going to Hot Topic to buy some new vest and some hot pants.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.000]   I saw the Apple Store.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.360]   I thought this would be a good time to pick up an iPhone.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   Right.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.640]   I can see it the first day.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.920]   It's kind of an event.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.240]   But a month later I have to think, "No, just do it online."
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.720]   I'm not sure what the attraction is.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.920]   It actually reflects a deep psychological problem in the American populace or actually
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.960]   the world because the same thing happens everywhere.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.760]   We somehow think this new device will make our life suddenly okay.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.880]   Our lives are going to suddenly get this shiny thing.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.520]   It has though.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.920]   With Apple Pay, right?
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.800]   I really think this is like, what was it?
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.600]   Neil Postman who wrote Distracted...
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   What did he write John?
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.320]   Distracted to death?
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.240]   The whole idea that we just put all of our hopes and fears and everything into these
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.680]   little shiny gadgets and we spend ridiculous amounts of money.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   It's $700.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   That's anti-sto-chumption.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.000]   And time in line.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.400]   And then we hope that we're going to get this home and then everything is going to
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.400]   be somehow better.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.000]   And then we drop it on the concrete and the screen cracks if you do it all over again.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.600]   That's why I was at the Apple Store yesterday to get an Apple Pay...
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.400]   Not Apple Pay.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.920]   Apple Care on this thing, just in case.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.120]   The Plus, did you get the Plus?
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120]   No, I didn't.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.880]   I have pockets.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.080]   So no Plus for me.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:11.080]   I don't think the Plus is a great deal because you only get two a year and you have to...
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.080]   Oh, Apple Care.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080]   Apple Care Plus.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.080]   No, I don't think I'm in the phone Plus.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.080]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   There's a Plus.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   Apple Care?
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.320]   Yeah, that's the replacement Apple Care.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.720]   I think that's the one I got.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.640]   But it seems like a not a good deal because the deductible is...
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   79 bucks.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.960]   And then you can only happen twice a year.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.880]   But actually, no, there is a method to this that my friends who are excellent scamming
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   these things are.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.240]   Right before you're going to get the next one, whether it's the 6S or the 7, you drop
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.520]   the phone, you take it in, they give you a brand new phone which has an amazingly high
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.360]   resale value because it's never been...
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   No kidding.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.880]   You leave it in the box and you get your new phone.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.240]   And then you can sell it at the best rate of life.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   Does David Moggs do that?
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.040]   No, he should not be doing that.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.080]   David Pogue, I do not believe does that.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   That's fine.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   Yes, I know many people who do that.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   I used to know a woman...
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   I worked with a bunch of engineers who would buy...
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   They'd take aim the system.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.400]   Who would go buy Manolo Blonick's shoes, you know, $1,000 shoes.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.840]   She'd put Duck's tape on the bottom of it, wear it to a party, take off the tape so it
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.640]   didn't look like it was worn and return it.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.640]   That's brilliant.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.480]   It's a scam!
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   Yes.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   It's brilliant.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.880]   Did you ever do that?
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.600]   Do not try this at home.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.640]   She's looking at me.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.120]   No.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.600]   I would never do such a thing.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.200]   Let's see.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.400]   They say the Google folks say that they think the higher price...
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.080]   This is how crazy it is.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.800]   On the Nexus 6, will actually mean they sell more of them.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.840]   That didn't make any sense.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.240]   We're selling Nexus...
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   This is Hiroshi Lockheimer.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.480]   That's the best name ever.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:56.360]   In fact, why was I Hiroshi Lockheimer from Halloween?
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.400]   Hiroshi Lockheimer, Vice President of Engineering at Android at Google, says, "We're selling
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:09.760]   the Nexus 6 in a way most people are used to buying it."
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   Through carol.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.920]   So the decision to go with a more expensive product was a result of feedback that showed
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.160]   an interest in a more premium feeling smartphone, but didn't the Nexus 5 feel premium?
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.720]   It did, but you could only get it online.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.080]   I think that's the big difference here is Google's finally stepping up and saying, "We
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:29.720]   are now putting our phones where most people buy their phones, which is the carriers."
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.520]   That's why he says, "While counterintuitive, Hiroshi Lockheimer said..."
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.080]   It sounds like I'm making it up.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.720]   "Hiroshi Lockheimer said he believes the more traditional price tag will actually spur
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   sales.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:48.160]   He's traditionally promoted the Play Store as the primary source to purchase Nexus devices,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.640]   and in fact, that's where it was sold out in 20 seconds.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:58.080]   But working with carriers, they'll be able to sell it subsidized 200 bucks with a two-year
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:04.040]   contract and people are..."
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   What's the word?
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.520]   I don't know what word are you looking for.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.040]   Dumb?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.320]   They think that that means the phone costs 200 bucks.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.200]   But of course, you have to have it to your contract and it gets amortized, baked into
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.560]   the higher cost of service.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.720]   Nexus fans says Hiroshi Lockheimer.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.440]   I'm going to give him his name.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.680]   Understand the pricing model of an unlocked device, but outside of that, paying $350 upfront
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:40.160]   was a foreign concept, let alone more $650.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   It's a nice phone.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.760]   I'm sorry that I didn't get one.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:48.440]   We're starting to learn about Lollipop, the features of the new Android 5, many of which
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.360]   are kind of taken from Motorola.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.000]   That's another thing that happened this week.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.720]   The transition to Lenovo happened.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.520]   Motorola is no longer a Google company, but Google stripped all the good ideas out of it
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.360]   before they let them go to Lenovo.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:15.000]   Lollipop, which is Android 5, will have the Moto X always the notifications, the kind
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.520]   of P active display they call it.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.480]   This is a good article from the Verge, the 12 Lollipop features.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.040]   Also it has the always listening thing, I believe.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.160]   Yes, you could say, "Okay, Google."
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:36.160]   That by the way, Google is now making it possible for app developers to turn that on.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.120]   So that you'll be able to do it within an app, and what's interesting is it'll send
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.360]   it back to the app.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.640]   Let's say it's Tripit.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.280]   You'll have searches that are Tripit specific.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.720]   You'll get back appropriate search results from Google to the app that you're in, which
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.520]   is kind of cool.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.120]   Let's say, what else?
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   You can knock on it.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.760]   Hardware allowing, that's something that OnePlus does.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.480]   Double tap wakes it up.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.160]   You just have to be careful that it doesn't fire off while you're carrying it in your pocket
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   or you're back.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.360]   You said that in the review, and they did make that harder.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.960]   They did in the update that turned on proximity sensor.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.320]   So double tapping it in your pocket, like your nipples hit it or something, and then
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   you rock our nipples.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.440]   Now it has nipple protection, thankfully.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.280]   Only because I have a OnePlus one.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   It won't wake it up.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.880]   The other thing is you had the flashlight was coming on.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.000]   That one's almost even worse, right?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.880]   Because then the flashlight's going off in your pocket.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.360]   You don't know until, of course, your leg burns, but that burns battery really fast.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.360]   You're glowing.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.600]   So they've kind of worked on that.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   Face unlock.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.080]   Okay, so it's always looking at you.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   Remember this?
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080]   Yes.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.400]   So the face unlock, which doesn't work well at all on Android, right?
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   The older versions of Android.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.400]   This is a part of the lock screen.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.560]   So you have different implementation of it.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.200]   I usually do a pattern, but you can have it look at you.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.120]   But you have to be just right in the right light.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.520]   You can't do it in the dark.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.840]   It wait, you wait a second, and then it unlocks.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.720]   Here's where they got it right this time though.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.600]   Last time it was how you unlocked your device.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.920]   You have to recognize my face.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.360]   And if you don't, after three seconds, then I had to put in my pin code.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:26.040]   So it took a ton of time to get into your phone, which doesn't work for a security method.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.760]   Now it's an extra thing that just when it works, it bypasses your pin number.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.240]   When it doesn't work, and basically what you're doing is it's another layer.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.560]   So if it recognizes your face, it starts looking at you as soon as you can.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   Yes, it does.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   That's true.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.840]   So the camera's always on?
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.600]   That's one way to put it.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.000]   Now, well, the camera's up on when you unlock.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.360]   When it's locked, yeah, it probably has proximity also.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.280]   So when it's no longer in a pocket, yeah.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.880]   It starts looking at you because they said most people are looking at their notifications
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.240]   for a little while before they unlock it.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.720]   So it's going to try to get a little head start on recognizing you.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.040]   That's cool.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.520]   And so what I do, in my case, I forget that I even set that up.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.000]   I just am used to entering in my pin code.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.080]   And then every once in a while, I don't have to.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.240]   That's because it recognized my face and it brings me right here.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.040]   But you could still have the pin code.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:28.200]   There'll be notifications in your lock screen, richer notifications than before in your
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.520]   lock screen, including, for instance, now you have to turn this on because you may not
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.680]   want to do this with a lock screen on, but you could respond to email.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:42.280]   You could do other stuff with the notifications without unlocking.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.080]   Although you can apparently do a redaction, if you wish, for some apps so that people don't
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.600]   see your emails and stuff.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:59.560]   There's something called priority mode, which lets you set what apps can disturb you and
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.120]   what can't.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.680]   So instead of do not disturb on an iPhone, when you turn on do not disturb, just nothing
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   happens.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.360]   But now you could say, well, you can wake me up, but not you.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.800]   You can make noise, but not you.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   This I like.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   There's a guest mode.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.440]   Oh, good.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.320]   So there, Android introduced last with KitKat, the idea of multiple users, right?
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.080]   So you can have profiles for tablets.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.920]   So now you can have, just as you do on a Chromebook, a guest mode, you have it on the
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.720]   Mac too, where you don't have to give some of your lock in.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   Just give them your login.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.280]   You give them the phone.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.320]   They go into guest mode.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.480]   They can do stuff that's erased when they log out.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.160]   I just want to be able, maybe, Jason, you know this, I just want to be able to get somebody
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.160]   a phone.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.600]   So here, look at this great picture I took on my kid.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.600]   Yes.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   Given the phone and not have them.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   They have that.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   They do.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.840]   It's called pinning.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   It's good for Leo too.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.560]   Because you can open a game, for instance, have, say Leo, you can play this game, but
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.240]   he can't exit.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.800]   Or you could have the photo up and he can't exit.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.360]   So you'd have to enter a passcode.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.360]   So I think these are all nice features.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.440]   And of course, then the biggest one that everybody will notice is this new flat card
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.160]   focused material design.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   It really does look good.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.080]   But only Jason's going to get it because he got the only Nexus 6 on it.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.840]   True, very soon after.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.680]   Do we know anyone else who got an Nexus 6?
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.680]   No.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   Nobody.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   Anybody in the chat room?
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   Any of you?
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.320]   Jason's the only person in the world who got an Nexus 6.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   I think that's true.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   That's why they sold out so quickly.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.960]   I'm glad I know you're there.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   I know you're there.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   I believe me.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.640]   I tried to get more than one, but I can only get one.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   Anyway, exciting.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   Exciting.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   All right.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   We've got more to talk about.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.800]   We're learning more about Windows 10.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.840]   And there's some new-- I want to talk a little bit about Finis watches because I know you
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.360]   can't talk about that one.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.280]   And I can't-- well, a little.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.440]   They told me I'd talk about a little.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.120]   He's wearing an NDA product on his-- he showed it.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:12.000]   Rafe Niedelman's here from the fabulous Yahoo Tech page, which by the way looks good.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   I don't know if it reads well.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   I'm reading it too.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   But OK.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.680]   Well, David Pogue, of course, is your lead there and is doing his traditional videos
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.360]   anchor doing a great job.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.560]   Anchor, is that what you call him?
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.080]   So I call him, yeah.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   Spiritual leader.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.560]   Here's Christian Bale and Seth Rogen.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:37.560]   So we found out, by the way, this week that we knew Christian Bale would play Steve Jobs.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.480]   Somebody in your office has Photoshopped.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.520]   We got that Photoshop from somebody else's office.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.920]   You know, Christian Bale is perfect for Steve Jobs.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.760]   He's got the intensity.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   He's got the look.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   He looks kind of like him.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.440]   But he also-- you feel like he could blow up, just like Jobs at any moment.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.760]   In fact, he has.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.920]   And I think Rogen is very much like Wozniak.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   He's cuddly.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   He's lovable.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.200]   I actually wrote to Steve and said, what do you think?
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.480]   Well, I wrote to his wife.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.640]   Steve speaks to me through his wife, Janet Wozniak.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.000]   And she said, Steve's excited.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.480]   Steve thinks Seth is a good choice.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.640]   He was less than--
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.400]   This makes three Jobs movies.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   And the three?
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   I know two.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.760]   Well, this is the third, right?
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   What's the other one?
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   I know there was--
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   There was that bad, bad one.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.560]   There was the bad one.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   And Steve hated that.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.160]   And then there was the other one.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.760]   I can't remember their names anymore.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.440]   There was another Jobs movie?
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.480]   Well, there was Fire in the Valley, and then there was--
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.840]   Oh, that's a real old one.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.040]   And the Revenge of the-- not Revenge of the Nerds, the Empire of the Mind, Empire of the Nerds.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   Mm.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.040]   Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.040]   Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.760]   No, while he was Steve Jobs.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   He was the best Jobs.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.120]   But he's too old now.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.000]   No, while he was a very good Steve Jobs, I thought.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.760]   OK, so yeah, if you include that, yeah.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.040]   Yeah, there have been others.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.280]   The Ashton Kutcher movie, Mr. Wozniak, hated.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   And it was a--
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   I couldn't watch it.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.280]   I couldn't watch it.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   I went and saw it in a theater.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.520]   It was terrible.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.440]   But Woz was offended because, for some reason, the makers of the movie, Ashton Kutcher, I
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.600]   guess, decided that it would be Steve Jobs who had the vision that the Apple II, the people
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600]   would want a computer.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   And he had to convince Woz that it was worth doing.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.440]   And of course, everyone knows.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.160]   It was Woz who had the vision.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.520]   He knew what he was doing.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.520]   He wanted a computer.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.520]   Everybody knew he wanted a computer.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:35.080]   Now, I think this looks good with the new-- the newly slimmed down Seth Rogen as Woz.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.200]   And I think he has that cuddle factor.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   Woz is cuddly.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.880]   Woz is the anti-jobs.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.200]   Woz doesn't like to say no.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.040]   I know Woz pretty well.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.320]   He'll say yes to anything.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.000]   I could see him in that role.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.400]   I don't know.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.400]   Hmm.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.440]   Anyway, I get distracted by the fabulous Yahoo Tech.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.440]   See?
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   There you go.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   You see how easy it is to people like.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.280]   You can get right in there.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.560]   Tech.yahoo.com.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.480]   Also here, Chris Breen from Macworld.com.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.800]   He does the Mac 911 column and a lot more.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.640]   Oh, look here, the review of Sunset Overdrive.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   I love that game.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.240]   Oh, so good.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.440]   It's the new Xbox One game.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   It's funny.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   It's great.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.440]   I don't know the console.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.440]   I'm afraid--
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   What?
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.440]   Because of the kit.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.440]   You don't want Leo to get sucked into it.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.920]   Yeah, I don't want my kid to get-- I'd never seen him again.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   Already I hardly ever seen him.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   Please, Minecraft like crazy, huh?
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   Minecraft, scratch, and now Python programming.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   So scratch is good.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   Oh gosh.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.520]   I hate it when the kids-- you know, that's terrible.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.440]   They get sucked into Python and you never see them again.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   I hate it when they--
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.280]   I just wanted to send me royalty checks.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   Only my kid would have gotten sucked into-- that's what I told my kid.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.920]   I said, look, this is my retirement plan.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.280]   Would you please become a hacker?
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   Exactly.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   No.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:01.000]   But I have to say, Henry did have all the consoles because I wanted them.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.560]   And he didn't become a video game nerd.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   He likes them.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:11.880]   It's part of the culture of his generation to play these games.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.120]   We're going to get one.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   He's busy enough though.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   He's got eight.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   He's eight.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.760]   We talked to him before the show and he's really smart kid.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.080]   Very, very smart kid.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.400]   He plays a piano.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   He's programming.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.440]   He's a Minecraft whiz.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.040]   He says, I want to do a Minecraft add-on where the rails could go upside down.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.920]   Are you going to help him with that?
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   He's beyond me.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   I said, what language is that?
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   He said, well, I think it's JavaScript.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   I am learning Python.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   Eight.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:44.440]   Last night he was hunched over the computer and he had the book and he was like, that's
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   so awesome.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.640]   I didn't do that until I was 14.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   No, eight's pretty young.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.240]   So smart kid, don't let him play sunset overdraft.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   So I'll never see him again.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   Never see him.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   He gets hooked.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.080]   Such a good game.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.080]   All right.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.880]   I've got to go play it.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   Well, I'm only going to play it for a little while because you know, Halo was a little
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.240]   master chief edition is out soon.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.120]   Isn't that just old Halo repops?
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   All the halos.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.400]   It's every map.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.000]   It's like a hundred gigabytes.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.760]   I've already pre-ordered it.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.040]   It's downloading right.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.840]   It's been downloading for weeks.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   Our show today brought to you Carbonite Online Backup.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.720]   Do not backup Halo on Carbonite because that's not a good idea.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.840]   Backup the stuff you did that only you have access to.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.520]   That's the beauty of Carbonite.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.760]   Everybody's got something on their computer that they cannot replace.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:47.400]   Whether it's pictures of the kid, your Python scripts, your financial records, it's so valuable.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.800]   And the problem is hard drives are such a tenuous thing to store it on.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.320]   We feel like, oh, they're so reliable, but you know they will break.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.480]   And if you're relying on a hard drive in your business, you're really taking a chance.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.880]   Carbonite is the solution.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.480]   So you have one computer at home, several at your small business.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:10.040]   If you have external drives, network attached storage, Carbonite has a solution for you
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.400]   automatic and continuous backup to the cloud.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.120]   And you can access your files anytime, anywhere with your apps.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:22.760]   You could log on to your Carbonite account on any computer and what are 50,000 businesses?
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.080]   Use Carbonite now.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.920]   And at home, Carbonite's awesome.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.920]   Here's the deal.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.200]   You could try it right now at Carbonite.com.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.240]   Use the workstation plans, the pro plans.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.240]   You'll see all the different plans.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.240]   Pick a plan.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.920]   You could try it free and use our offer code TWIT when you do.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.320]   They'll ask you, what was the offer code?
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.960]   You say TWIT because then when you buy, you get two extra months.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.360]   You pay by the year or two years or three years.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.760]   That's nice because you don't have to think about it.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.880]   You just buy it and you just done.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.680]   They never meet your, how much data.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.120]   And they also have advanced plans for businesses that include a Carbonite appliance that does
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.320]   local and cloud backup.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.120]   There's lots of really good solutions.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:07.240]   Carbonite.com, no credit card required for that free trial and do use the offer code
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.040]   TWIT because that way you get two months free when you buy.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.680]   We had a good week on TWIT this week.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.760]   Do you have the cut down?
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.240]   We did a little thing, I believe I do.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.880]   A little kind of, this is what you might have missed if you missed anything this week.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   Let's check it out.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.600]   Previously on TWIT.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.840]   We're going to look at terrifying tech.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.000]   Oh my word, Chad.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   I'm your monster.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.760]   I don't like the way it smells.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.920]   Before you buy.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.040]   We have sitting right here on the new iMac that Apple announced a couple of weeks ago.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.640]   This is the 5K iMac.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.640]   Tech news today.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.760]   Current C which is the alternative to Apple Pay and Google Wallet being foisted on retail
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.560]   store customers has already been hacked.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.960]   Coding 101.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.000]   All you artists out there who are doing things with our doinos, you're riding C code.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   That's awesome.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   TWIT.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.640]   Making the world safe for technology.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.520]   I'm glad to see you dressed up too.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.240]   I see that Alex didn't wear a costume today.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.280]   He never gets in the spirit of Halloween.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:08.240]   Alex, the red shirt gumple we call him.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.880]   He's gone.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   That was it.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.160]   We left him on the planet.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.160]   We are talking TWIT.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:20.080]   We are talking tech, Chris Breen, Macworld.com.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.920]   From Yahoo Tech.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.480]   My old friend, Ralph Needleman.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.000]   Did you set your clocks?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.760]   Did you remember to set your clocks back or forward or whatever the hell we were supposed
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.760]   to do?
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.600]   Every year a fewer and fewer clocks have to be set manually.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.600]   Isn't that nice?
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.640]   I wake up my bedside clock.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   Knows what time it is.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   The hall clock knows what time it is.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   It's the oven.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.200]   The oven has a microwave which has a broken one key.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:51.040]   So I have to wait until there's a time without a one in it until I can set it.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.760]   Other than that, it's all automatic.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.080]   I live with somebody who's a little bit finicky and if the clock and the microwave and the
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.920]   oven don't match, that's a problem.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.920]   Oh, that's the worst.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.680]   You need to have to be within like arms reach and everything.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.680]   Beep.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.680]   Set them at the same time.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.680]   You know what frustrates me?
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.760]   I buy radio clocks because I want every thing on the clock.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.280]   But you have to put them outside sometimes.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.320]   They don't sense the change.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.320]   Right.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   So I have to put them at...
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.600]   True change comes from within.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.160]   Not these things.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:26.000]   You put them on the deck and let them sit them for a day.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.240]   I want to begin right here.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.720]   Now's the time to end daylight savings time forever.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.720]   Saving.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.720]   Saving for me.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.720]   Yeah, you'll be in trouble.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   You should say savings.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   I know.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   I got a guy who works with me because it's...
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.280]   Or it moves Arizona.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   They're smart.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   They got rid of it.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   Or Hawaii.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   Or Hawaii.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.760]   So that's even more confusing because it's adhered to by some and not by all.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.760]   Right.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:58.080]   We know now that daylight saving time saves no energy because in Indiana where they adopted
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:03.800]   it in bits and pieces you could see and you can actually say it was a net zero change
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:10.360]   because it turns out yes people use lights less but they use their conditioner more.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:15.200]   Because they're up more in the warm weather so it ended up being a net zero.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.600]   So that was one argument saves energy.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   No, it doesn't.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   It's better for farmers.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   No.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.000]   Great article in the National Geographic last year.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   I'm going to point...
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.800]   But this goes back to the Ben Franklin era doesn't it?
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.360]   No, that's another conard.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.360]   It's full of conards.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.160]   So when did this start?
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.160]   1940s.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.160]   No.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.160]   Yes.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.480]   So Franklin talked about it as a joke.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.320]   Franklin didn't die until 1952.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.320]   Right.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.880]   He's often invoked in this thing like oh was it vetted by Ben Franklin but it wasn't implemented
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.400]   until the war.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.680]   It was a World War II attempt to save.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.120]   There's actually a book by...
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:01.200]   This is the National Geographic article from a year ago but there's a book by a professor
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:08.880]   at Tufts called "Spring Forward the Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time."
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.200]   He points out no energy savings.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.520]   Farmers in fact were so against it they were the only group to actively lobby against it.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.720]   They just don't want it.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.160]   You know who likes and it's by the way hazardous to your health.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:28.400]   A 2012 study by the University of Alabama at Birmingham found the risk of heart attacks
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.360]   surges 10% on the Monday and Tuesday after we turn the clocks ahead.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:38.840]   Because you're rushing to work and you suddenly keel over and there are many more accidents.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.360]   I mean we know that also.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.560]   I don't know why there's more heart attacks.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.880]   It's because your circadian rhythms screwed up.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.480]   You're late for a meeting and you're running around.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.200]   It's like oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.080]   Sleep deprivation.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:58.000]   The bodies, circadian clock and immune responses all come into play with consider reasons that
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.600]   changing the time by an hour is detrimental to your health.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.120]   New England Journal of Medicine showed that in Sweden heart attack risk rose just after
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.640]   the spring time change.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.200]   They think it has to do with disturbed sleep or maybe just running around like crazy.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.960]   You're tired.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.080]   You're jet lagged.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.880]   Why are we inflicting this on each other?
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:22.440]   You know who benefits the US barbecue industry?
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:28.280]   They say the month when you set the clocks ahead they make 150 million more dollars and
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.640]   the golf industry estimated that an extra month of daylight savings time was worth 200
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.800]   to 400 million dollars because more golfers are out there and gas stations because we drive
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   around more.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.680]   Another reason it doesn't save energy.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:48.040]   Because there are powerful forces of evil that slide against the sense of what is right
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   and good in the world.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.200]   Paying off Congress.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.700]   Okay.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.700]   So what else is new?
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.800]   The TV industry.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.760]   If you look at Nielsen ratings during the first week of daylight saving no matter when
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.680]   it is even the most popular shows go down 10 to 15 percent because everybody's playing
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:08.240]   golf and barbecuing and barbecuing while they're playing golf.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.600]   It's at annual cost of $1.7 billion according to Utah State University economist.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   So let's stop it.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   Let's just stop the insanity.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:25.360]   We've now three or four months to lobby before we have to turn the clocks forward again.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.560]   Or just move to Arizona.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.720]   Arizona except for residents of the Navajo nation.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.120]   They decided they wanted to.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120]   Seriously.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   Yes.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.920]   Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   Don't.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   They don't do it.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   Russia.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:49.080]   Hey, if I were a dictator, if Russia has daylight saving time, there's no hope.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.000]   If I were a dictator, I just eliminated it.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.680]   The chat room will know because I thought I heard something.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.960]   No, time changes you in Russia.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960]   Russia.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.400]   Time changes you.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.760]   There's no excuse for it.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   I'm sorry I got on that tangent there.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.600]   What about time clause in the spring though?
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:15.360]   Because I know as a kid, you know, you're going to get a brighter sky the next day and
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.560]   you're waiting for time clause to come along with this big sack of clocks and then you
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   can come to the.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560]   Time clause.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.760]   It sounds like something made up by the golf industry.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   No, no, no.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   Time clause.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   You didn't sit around and roast little watches over the fire waiting for time clause.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.560]   Welcome to time clause.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.560]   All right, let's talk.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.920]   Since we're talking fitness, let's talk about watches and fitness.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.320]   There's a new fit bit coming.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.480]   I guess you must be into this because you're wearing this new basis.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   I had the original basis.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   I liked it.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   This is their next one.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.320]   It was about the smartest watch out there.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.320]   Yeah, it looks pretty hideous.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320]   Has did the old one.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.320]   It's very functional.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.880]   But it actually doesn't look like it's trying to be something.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880]   It's not.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   Now, this is Intel bought them, right?
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.480]   Yeah, Intel bought this company and it does steps and the cool thing about it is it does
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.080]   heart rate, which they all do now.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.720]   It's kind of a standard feature.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.240]   Yeah, the Moto 360 does heart rate.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240]   Not very well.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.040]   It has the thing on the back that does it do heart rate?
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.960]   Oh, look, it's it's trying to measure my heart rate.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.800]   Does it do heart rate when you're exercising?
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.720]   Because it does heart rate continuously.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Okay.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.000]   Because a lot of these and it'll show you your heart rate, that's an improvement.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.920]   Yeah, because a lot of them say you have to stand still and don't make any noise.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   That never happens.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.400]   I know.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   What good is that?
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.640]   Well, it's measures heart rate all the time.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.280]   The battery's supposed to last four days.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.160]   The Bluetooth stuff hasn't turned on yet, so it's not giving me all my alerts, but it
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160]   does sync to the phone.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.240]   Oh, so you do have some notifications?
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.520]   No, I'm not getting any notifications.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520]   But you would.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.240]   Theoretically, that's coming.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.440]   It's, yeah, we'll see.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.440]   How much?
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.440]   I don't know.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   Unannounced.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.840]   200, 300 around there.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:57.560]   The problem is that the other companies like Fitbit and Apple, they're all about the same
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.880]   price range and they seem to have more design chops.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.640]   Well, Apple certainly.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   Not the same price range necessarily.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.600]   But it keeps the thing that gets me to all these things.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.120]   They're all, they're looking for a reason to be, right?
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.520]   So they're all pushing health because that's what they can actually do for you that a
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.720]   regular watch can.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.560]   And they all want to also measure your sleep, which is a double problem because who wants
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   to wear a watch at night?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   Well, the funny thing is-
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.360]   And you got to charge them all the time.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.360]   Apple apparently has put into its Apple Watch.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.160]   You know, it has the Taptic Feedback.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.320]   We're just, it does.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.960]   I've been told it doesn't actually buzz.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.680]   It's just like somebody's actually tapping you, poking you.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.680]   That's pretty cool.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   Thanks.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.600]   So they have a Taptic Feedback alarm that'll wake you up.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   Okay.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   But we also know that the I watch won't get through, Apple Watch won't get through a day
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   without charging.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   Right.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   So what good is that?
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   You buy two.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   This is my night watch.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.440]   You buy a watch for your day watch.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.440]   That's useless.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.400]   But the tap thing is actually unbelievably cool.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.400]   Have you thought that?
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.480]   No, no, no, no.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   But the thing about it that I like is the integration with maps.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   Did you hear about that?
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   No.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.120]   Where if you have walking directions to somewhere-
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.360]   It'll say left.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.440]   It will tap you differently for the left go straight, go right.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.160]   So you come to an intersection and it goes, oh, that means go left.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.160]   See that is one use for-
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.160]   I have the Moto 360.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.840]   And I've tried a bunch of them, including the old basis.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.800]   This is the one I've stuck with the longest.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:32.760]   And that was one really good use for this was you can do, okay, Google, you know, take
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.080]   me to the airport.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.480]   Well, actually this was for walking around London.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.520]   So take me to the Tower of London.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.880]   And it would put the map on the watch face.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.160]   It would take your next turn would be on the watch face.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.400]   And it would buzz when it was time to change direction.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   Oh, cool.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400]   But it didn't go left, right.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.240]   It would just buzz and you have to look.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.840]   But I thought that worked really well.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.560]   That was a good use for this.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.720]   So you have that set so it automatically comes on.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   When you do that, hey, actually-
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.200]   That's a disadvantage in a way is that these don't, they're not like a real watch where
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.200]   they're always on.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   This one's always on.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   I will say that.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   Because it looks crappy.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   It does look pretty crappy.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   So it's, but it's always crappy.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   It's not intermittently crappy.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.320]   This looks good, but it's only, and you can make this look like a Rolex people.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.000]   There's all sorts of faces out there for this.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.840]   Anyway, Fitbit has some new ones.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.400]   They really have kind of owned this market because they were the first.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.160]   I remember when they were, was it a Kickstarter?
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.160]   They were a, I think it was some sort of crowd funded thing.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   Fitbit?
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.160]   No.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   No?
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.800]   Fitbit, I remember when they announced at a, either a tech launch or a launch conference.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   Maybe that was it.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   It was just a startup.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   Ages ago.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.360]   And nobody had really had this idea yet.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.520]   I mean, it was a pedometer.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   Let's face it.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   It was a funny year for.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520]   Talk to your phone.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   Yeah, it was a clip.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   You have lost many of them.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   Many, many.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520]   Brilliant design.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520]   Last of day.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.720]   San Diego Zoo has one of my Fitbits.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720]   Right.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720]   One's in Paris.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.280]   Good place to lose a Fitbit.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.320]   One's in the toilet.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   But they fall off.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.320]   They fall off really easily.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.560]   Anyway, they've gone to the band because that doesn't fall off.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.600]   Their newest ones have been announced.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.120]   The Fitbit Charge, HR and the Surge.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.800]   They all do the same thing with a heart rate tracking.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   And as a result, they're kind of bulky.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:21.440]   These will be out early next year.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.560]   This is a replacement for the Force, which was pulled back because it had nickel in it
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.040]   and made people itchy.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040]   So this is the-
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.280]   That was a PR disaster.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280]   It was a Fitbit.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   But Jawbone.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   Remember the Jawbone up?
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.520]   What a PR disaster that was.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.200]   Basically, they took them all back.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.080]   Wait, which one is the one?
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.880]   The seat by association.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   Association.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   Well, this thing has-
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.440]   This is the one that had the irritated people, right?
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.440]   No, no.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.440]   The Fitbit Flexit here.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.440]   The Fitbit Force was the one that you did.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.440]   Jawbone broke.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440]   Jawbone just didn't work.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440]   Right.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.440]   Okay.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.160]   This has been a problematic category.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.880]   It's one of those harder than it looks category.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.400]   I think everybody's trying to get these out now before the Apple Watch comes out.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.960]   This has that same heart rate monitor.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.640]   It's not the same company that makes it that blinks.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.600]   So that's all the time.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.280]   So you would get a graph at the end of the day that would show how your heart rate-
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.280]   That's useful.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.880]   That's how you do how to shape your heart all the time.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   Right.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   I need that.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:24.200]   Yeah, this seems like this is kind of like a new PDA category.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.920]   The idea being that these are the single use devices.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.200]   And that once we do get something like the Apple Watch that's not only a terminal for
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.520]   your iPhone but also access a trigger for HomeKit and a controller for your Apple TV
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.040]   and the various things that it's going to do, these other things are going to seem like
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.240]   single purpose wannabes and like, well, why would we need that anymore?
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.320]   Let's just get this one device that does everything and then we'll get another one the
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   next year because of course it'll do new magical things.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.800]   And I feel sorry for the people who get the gold ones who are going to spend.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.480]   I don't know how many thousands of dollars and find out.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.200]   Oh, you mean there's one that's thinner and it doesn't require an iPhone?
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.480]   I don't think the Apple says we're going to do a drop in replacement.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.280]   I was wondering if they were going to do that and do some kind of rebate or basically
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.360]   six grand and that's what the rough estimates are.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.000]   We talked about this last week at six grand, a gold watch would be a good deal.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.640]   Wow.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.680]   So even at six grand, if it's obsolete next year, that's not good.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:28.160]   So thinking is maybe Apple will have a subscription service.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.640]   Microsoft's in this business.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.040]   Paul Thorett got his Microsoft band.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.400]   He says, "Even after less than a day of use, it's pretty clear the Microsoft band is big,
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.280]   bulky, uncomfortable and complex enough to dissuade many from using it."
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.880]   It's a perfect Microsoft product.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.920]   He does say there's magic here.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:55.600]   You've got Microsoft Health Services, which he says are more comprehensive than the Health
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.560]   Kit or Google's Health Service thing.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.760]   But the band itself and I've heard others say this is just kind of uncomfortably bulky.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.160]   All of them are.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   None of them are great.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.400]   The thing is for the heart rate thing to work, it has to be pressed against your skin.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   Right.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   That's why.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.400]   So thank goodness.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   This is flat.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400]   It's not curved.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   You could see in the picture on the...
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.400]   Yeah, it's like the first...
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.400]   Yes, I see.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.400]   ...the first square Google watches.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   Right.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.680]   Even though they're pretty much the same size as the round one you have, they just don't
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.680]   sit well.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:32.840]   He says it's like wearing handcuffs and you're always aware the device is there.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.320]   It does have a very nice screen, which does a lot, including notifications, of course.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.440]   It's not just a fitness band.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.920]   He does have sleep monitoring.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.520]   He says the results were not inspiring because I felt like I slept well.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.720]   But according to the band, I only got four and a half hours of sleep, one of which was
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   restful.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.520]   That's bad.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:02.800]   When the band tells you that you had a crappy night's sleep, you thought you felt fine.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   Until you saw that.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.120]   No, it just ends up an alert that says get a sleep app.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.440]   You snore it all night.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   You kept me up.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.200]   It says all night.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.160]   Somebody in the felt in the chat room says the new name of this is the Microsoft Shackle.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   It does look like you're under house arrest a little bit.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.960]   Put it around your ankle.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   Wow.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.760]   Actually, could wear that around the ankle for monitoring.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.280]   It wouldn't be quite so obtrusive.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.760]   I actually have done that with my Fitbit.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:36.600]   Because all of these have one big failing is that they measure walking and running, but
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.560]   no other form of exercise.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.800]   You work out row and I work out for hours rowing and it says you didn't do anything today.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.200]   So I start taking to put it again on my ankle.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.200]   Doesn't help.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.000]   Basically, same thing doesn't help.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.680]   They should know bicycling because they can switch to new ones.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.840]   Like the high end of the Fitbit watch, it says GPS.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.160]   So it knows how fast you're moving and basically exists in an hour range between walking and
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.160]   driving.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.160]   So it should know.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.520]   Oh yeah, G-L-GPS, that would tell you.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.680]   Some of these have GPS's.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.600]   Most of them don't because that's a real battery killer.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600]   Right.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   Well, that's the new thing.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.200]   I mean, the Timex has one that has GPS and a cellular radio.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   And it looks by the way, it looks like it.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.560]   It looks like it was invented by the Soviets in 1958.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.200]   It's then I'm going to do a sci-fi movie and that's going to be a communicator.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.920]   It just looks like it.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.560]   The Will I Am one has a-
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.080]   The Will I Am one.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.160]   Okay, come on.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.160]   Really?
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.120]   Is that a contender?
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.400]   It's a statement.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.640]   I'll say that.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   It's huge.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.960]   Do you have, we got to get an image of the Will I Am watch?
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.240]   We interviewed Will I Am?
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.680]   I thought this was a joke.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.800]   No, he's serious.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.240]   This guy, Will I Am is a really interesting, different guy who has a tech entrepreneur.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.000]   He keeps throwing stuff against the wall.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   And he knows-
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   He's a smart guy.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.920]   So he said, don't call it a watch.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.440]   Will I Am you should know, he's the frontman for Black Eyed Peas.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.440]   He's great.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.840]   He's a great rapper, a great performer, a great musician.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.520]   It's called the Pulse or Pulse?
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520]   P-L-S.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]   Pulse.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.920]   Here's Will I Am with a C-net.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   He's also wearing a backpack.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.960]   So that makes him a fashion accessory.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   What the hell are he wearing?
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   Is that a tennis racket?
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   What is he wearing on his back?
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   Jetpack.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   It's just the-
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   He's telling you, smart guy.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.840]   I think he's the kind of watch.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   So, and it's not a smart watch.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840]   It's a whole new thing.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:39.120]   It's a new paradigm, a new category called a pulse.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.560]   Over here, your notifications are here.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   Your navigation is here.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.080]   So you just got to imagine you have three things here.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.120]   I like it that some people are trying stuff.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.040]   I mean, we have a long way to go before this stuff is useful.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   Nothing down.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.040]   Are you-
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040]   But he's trying stuff.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.040]   From here, you get your note of your little-
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.040]   In that menu-
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   Can you buy this?
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.840]   Some cool features like five.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.680]   I don't know if it's available yet.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.040]   This is Brian Tong at C-net interviewing Will I Am on the watch.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.560]   If you choose to, you're called.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.800]   So there's everybody in there, brother.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800]   I like this one.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.800]   This is the new one from HP.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.520]   They got a designer to do this one.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520]   Michael Bestia.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.000]   Let me show you this one here.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.080]   It actually looks like a watch.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.960]   It's called the MB Chrono Wing.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   An alligator strap for 650 bucks.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.960]   Sapphire crystal.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.960]   Anybody?
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.800]   So this one puts the little, has a little watch insert and a little-
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   That's an LCD screen.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   Don't be fooled.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   The whole thing is LCD.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Yes.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.800]   Because every picture I've seen of this watch has the watch insert in the same exact case.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.480]   You can't get rid of it.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.480]   It has-
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.320]   Does not have a touch screen.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.120]   It's just buttons and not a few.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.120]   Lots of buttons.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.120]   I like buttons.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.680]   I don't know, at least it looks like a watch.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.680]   This is so cool.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.760]   I mean, everybody's trying different design ideas.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.840]   That's what I like.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.520]   And the watch manufacturers are getting involved.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.720]   The fashion people are getting involved.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.760]   The fitness people are getting involved.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.840]   And it's all this battle for the wrist, the wrist top battle.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.320]   Right.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.920]   This cannot track your steps.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.440]   This cannot measure your heart rate.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440]   This does not beep.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.800]   It has no touch screen.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.400]   It has no microphone.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.400]   Perfect.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.760]   But it tells time beautifully.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.600]   It does tell time.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   And you know what?
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.600]   You credit with all of this innovation to the Apple rumor mill.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.640]   Because all of these things were created before Apple announced an Apple watch.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.480]   But on the basis of the rumor that Apple would be doing a watch.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.880]   And everybody said, "Scurry, scurry, hurry, hurry.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.800]   Get to this market before Apple does."
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.800]   Still no matter.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   I mean, Apple does.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800]   Exactly.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.800]   Not that it's going to help very much.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.800]   Apple, not only-
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:48.800]   Sorry.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.120]   No, I was just saying you're right.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.920]   When Apple comes out, everything else will disappear or will be also ran and they'll
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.560]   discount things highly.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.920]   I'm not convinced that Apple's got it either.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920]   No, no, no.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.880]   I think the- I am very excited about the version 2 Apple watch.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.360]   These things, the battery life is no good.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.360]   They're bulky.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.520]   The UI is first-gen and almost all the products.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:21.800]   But I kind of like the idea of this stuff working, but this stuff is too bulky and itchy.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.560]   I don't like itchy products.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   You wouldn't have liked my Halloween costume.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560]   It's very itchy.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:35.240]   HP is going to do a 3D printer next year.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.240]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.960]   You get a big company like HP into this.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.080]   They say it is not going to be a hobbyist printer.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:49.320]   It'll be targeted at business, kind of like the big HP printers that people use for plotting
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.000]   and big prints and stuff to make billboards and posters.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.560]   It will be designed to produce a wide range of functional objects and industrial components.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560]   This is interesting.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:08.600]   HP, I think you can fairly credit with the inkjet explosion.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   By which I do not mean the actual explosion of inkjet materials.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.040]   Sounds like an okay-go song.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.760]   Oh, that has happened.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.520]   But the sudden growth of the inkjet industry was driven initially, I think, by HP.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.520]   So it would be interesting.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.800]   Well, you kind of wonder, though, if they had a big meeting at HP and so what do we still
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800]   do?
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   Well, we don't do medical equipment anymore.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.960]   We don't do this and that.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.040]   Oh, we still make printers.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040]   So what's cutting edge in printers?
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   Right.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040]   3D printing.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.560]   All right, let's do that because I'm not sure what else HP has got going for it.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.360]   I mean, the server stuff is still happening, but they've pared down what they used to do
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.600]   to such an extent that I think they need some kind of product that's going to step forward
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.200]   and say, "No, we're still in the game and this is what we're going to do now to keep
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.200]   us going."
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.000]   HP can't not do 3D printers.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.520]   Okay, that's fair.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.520]   I don't know how big the market is.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.200]   Can Epson not do 3D printers?
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.720]   Everybody's going to be doing 3D printers.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.920]   There will be some standardized technology that we need.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.920]   That's what we need.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.760]   But the price of the printheads will come down.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.560]   The price of the epoxy or whatever the plastic will go way up, right?
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.800]   So everybody's going to make money selling things.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.560]   Now they're going to have to convince us that we actually need to print stuff in 3D.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.520]   I mean, what was the last time at your house you needed to make a knob?
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.680]   That's what everybody always says.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.200]   Oh, my knob fell off and I made one.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.200]   That's always the thing.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   Right.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   So it takes what?
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   How long right now?
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.200]   To make a knob.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.840]   Make kind of a crappy looking plastic.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.680]   Which you meant to sell up sand.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.680]   It will.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.680]   It's where the one comes out wrong.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.360]   They say HP will support shapeways, which I guess is the closest thing to a standard.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.200]   That's the 3D model database.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   So that's good.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.840]   Oh, Amazon figured out what's wrong with the fire phone.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.520]   So relieved.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.720]   They said we just priced it wrong.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.120]   You know, that's what they picked.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.120]   That's what's wrong.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.120]   That is not what's wrong.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   No.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.120]   I went to it.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.120]   You could give me $50.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.440]   I wouldn't take it.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.400]   Well, they still priced it wrong because they should give you a hundred.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.960]   No, they, they were, they've been trying to socialize this idea about the, oh, we just
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.480]   priced it wrong as the reason the phone flopped.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:28.880]   I was at an event and some Amazon person told me this.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.640]   I was like, okay, sure, whatever you say.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:39.440]   No, this is what Amazon did was they underestimated the importance of standards.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.800]   And yes, that it runs a forked version of Android and yes, it has its own app store.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:50.120]   But people just want a phone that exists in an ecosystem that they know is robust.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.880]   They could have looked at Windows and the Windows phone and realized that that's the
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880]   case.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.720]   Windows phones are great and they're making, they're beginning to make headway, but it's
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.720]   taken years.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:08.120]   Years from Microsoft to push that phone out, to drive the prices down and to really cozy
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.400]   up to developers to get the apps out there.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.880]   And the Windows phone is actually unique.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.160]   It's, I mean, the Windows, it's got a really innovative and beautiful UI.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.640]   It's different from the Android.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   And it's still.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   Yes.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.680]   It's too late and wasn't part of an ecosystem that was either Android or iOS.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680]   Yes.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not counting out Windows phones now only because I see them now.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.680]   Everywhere I go, I do.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.680]   And that's weird to me.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.680]   Because for the first couple of years, you never saw Windows phone, but now they're
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.680]   beginning to pop up.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   I'd just like to see that.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.680]   We could use a third.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.800]   And I was a little hopeful that fire OS would make a fourth, but it isn't.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.400]   It's not, it's not enough.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:54.240]   Amazon did also announce this week the fire TV stick, which is an excellent name.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.240]   Firestick.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.040]   And, and this one they've priced rice.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040]   It's not out yet.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040]   It'll be out before Christmas.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.680]   $39 for briefly.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.480]   You could get it for $19 if you were a prime member.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.360]   They sold out of those really fast.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360]   Yes.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.360]   No.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360]   Did you get one?
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.360]   No.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.360]   I have a fire TV and I haven't hooked it up yet.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.640]   So I don't know what I need a stick for.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.800]   It's the same as the fire TV.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800]   20 bucks.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   This is a great stocking stuffer.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   It is a good.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.000]   Well, or, well, what would you get?
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.320]   Crumbcast or a fire TV stick?
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   Roku.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.240]   Roku makes a stick too.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.240]   Right.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   But it's, it's more expensive.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.240]   It's like 50 bucks.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   Yeah, Roku.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240]   You're right.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.480]   Why even bother?
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.960]   I do like the Crumbcast.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.320]   I don't have a Crumbcast yet.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:41.280]   Now, and what's interesting is that Google is now putting a lot of that Crumbcast stuff
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.960]   on other platforms, like on the Roku.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.200]   So this thing is that this whole battle is not about the hardware.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.200]   It's about the, what is it about?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.480]   It's about the streaming services.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.840]   And if you're Amazon, you want people to use Amazon Prime, Amazon video.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.200]   If you're Roku, well, you sell the hardware.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.080]   If you're Google, it's Google Play, but everybody's got to support everybody else because that's
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.800]   the way the world is right now.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:14.520]   And I don't know whether there are, if you have to pay Netflix to a couple of pennies
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.320]   to stream a video onto a Roku or something like that.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.320]   I wouldn't think so.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.040]   I mean, wouldn't Netflix want to be just everywhere?
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040]   Why would I?
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.400]   Right, Netflix wants to be everywhere.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.160]   So all these guys are trying to be on every platform.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.440]   So it's not about the hardware.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.440]   It's not about the hardware.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.120]   Actually, Hulu Plus is almost everywhere.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.320]   Spotify and Pandora are getting there.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.400]   Amazon Video is pretty much everywhere.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.520]   Amazon Prime Video is almost anywhere.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520]   Except Apple TV.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   Oh, right.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   Of course.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   Oh, and Apple TV.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   I don't know where they are.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.280]   Well, the Apple has the iTunes store and they're exclusive on Apple TV.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:55.160]   Right, I think part of the advantage of this firestick is that Apple TV owners are going
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.600]   to want it because I've got Amazon Prime, but I can't get it on my Apple TV.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:03.560]   I have a Roku box, but it's sort of way to put Amazon Prime.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.760]   Just throw it on there for 20 bucks or 30 bucks.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.160]   That makes sense.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:12.280]   Do you think the television companies can end the pain by just putting this stuff into
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.280]   the TV?
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.280]   Come on.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.000]   Have you seen Samsung software?
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   Tel-G software.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   I use it.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   It's horrible.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.440]   My TV, I forget what my TV is, is LG.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.040]   It actually does almost all the stuff except the interface is so terrible.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   The same is true with my receiver.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:34.280]   No, I mean Roku, Google, Amazon, Apple, they know how to make software.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.280]   Not the TV companies.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.280]   No.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.640]   I mean, I kick myself every time I am reminded that I paid extra to have all these smart
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   TV features.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.840]   All I need is a monitor.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840]   That's it.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.840]   You don't even need a tuner anymore.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   No.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:47.840]   Cable TV.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.260]   LG is a screen with a bunch of, it would be nice to have a bunch of HDMI inputs.
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:58.040]   Yeah, I have, so Panasonic's not bad.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040]   It's okay.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040]   It's usable.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040]   But why?
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040]   It does probably does.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.040]   I mean--
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.040]   It doesn't do all this stuff.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040]   That's not your right.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040]   That's not your right.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040]   That's not your right.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.040]   Your boxes or the sticks do more.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.040]   So why switch between them?
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040]   Nothing's worse than Samsung's Smart TV though.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040]   I just haven't tried that one.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.040]   Horrible.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.680]   Horrible platform.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.080]   It's the fire phone of TVs.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.080]   That's--
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.600]   Firephone is actually that UI with the fake 3D.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600]   You like that?
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.640]   It's-- let me qualify that.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.400]   It's really cool.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.400]   Interesting.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.480]   It's no reason at all to buy a phone because it's just glitzy.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.920]   It doesn't do anything of value at all.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920]   It would--
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.640]   Even firefly does it, really.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:45.600]   The maps are neat and you could do-- because you can look under things.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.880]   That's all that time doing this.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.880]   And it has potential for games, but unless people actually buy the phone--
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.960]   Nobody's going to write a game that uses it.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   No.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.440]   Panasonic-- I'm sorry.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.840]   LG is killing-- the last company to make plasma TVs has decided to go out of the plasma
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.840]   business, so that's it.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   That's sad.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:08.120]   It is over for what everybody agreed was these best TV technology out there.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.960]   The LP of TV technology.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.080]   Panasonic, which made those great V-air as that's the one I have.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.120]   Those are great plasma TVs.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.560]   Many agreed the best TV's made.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.560]   Nope.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.560]   Samsung.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.560]   Nope.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.120]   And finally, LG, the last company making plasma.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.960]   But you know, I think OLED is probably taken over for that.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.760]   Yeah, but OLED is still pricey, right?
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.320]   It's very expensive still, yeah.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.960]   Yeah, I still have two plasmines and I absolutely love the thing.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960]   Yeah, don't care rid of them.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.680]   No, I'm not going to, but trying to get one of them broke and trying to get parts of
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.840]   the thing is really hard.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.840]   And this was a Panasonic from just about three years ago.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.360]   And it's, I waited six weeks to get a part for the thing and they had to take it out
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.800]   of another one that had broken.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.320]   So they, they don't, you know, like Apple with the parts for the iPod classic, they do
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.600]   not have a lot on the shelves.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.040]   So you, you're going to have a hard time with the thing busts.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.640]   I have the last plasma right here.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.640]   You can have it.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.560]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:13.240]   Audio books from Audible are the best, the best way to spend time in the car at the gym,
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.320]   walk in the dog doing the dishes.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.040]   You're reading, people hate it when I use the word reading, but every word that's on
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.400]   the page is going into your ears.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.760]   You're experiencing the book in a way that is unique.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.080]   I am a fanatic and I think you know that I've been an Audible subscriber since the year
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.080]   2000.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.080]   I have over 500 books in my library and I encourage everybody to give it a try.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.840]   The new Amy Poehler first book is out.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.000]   Yes, please.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.600]   It's from Saturday Night Live cast member Amy Poehler star of Parks and Rec.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.520]   She reads it.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.840]   So that's, you know, there's a plus there when you hear her voice.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.800]   Actually, it's not just her.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:59.920]   Carol Burnett, Seth Myers, mom and dad, Emily, I'm sorry, Eileen and William Poehler.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.240]   Patrick Stewart is in this book.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.240]   Kathleen Turner.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   I'm going to live.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   I wonder if this is.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:13.520]   The truth is writing is hard and boring and occasionally great, but usually not.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.560]   Even I have lied about writing.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.080]   I've told people that writing this book has been like brushing away dirt from a fossil.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.040]   What a lot of this.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.200]   Amy Poehler, the book is.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.300]   Yes, please.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.960]   How would you like to get this and another book?
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.280]   Gary Rachel Dratch has a new book, Neil Patrick Harris.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.160]   I'm hearing very good things about his new biography.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.840]   Choose your own autobiography.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:44.360]   It's actually adapted from the printed edition by the author.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:49.280]   So because this book was weird where you would jump from different, you would literally,
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:56.160]   like one of those choose your own games, they've made it work in Audible somehow.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.440]   I love Neil Patrick Harris.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   Give it a try.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.600]   Visit Audible.com, pick two books, and then go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.080]   You're going to sign up for the platinum account.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.920]   That's a two book a month subscription plan.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.760]   And I think that's what I have.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   I listened to two books a month, easy.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.000]   And you get the Daily Digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, so you get
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.520]   to keep up on what's going on in the world.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.520]   Audible is so much fun.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.640]   I'm listening to Whiskey Tango Fox, Foxtrot right now, which is a great techno thriller
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.760]   for people who are worried about the NSA.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   It confirms every fear that you might have and then some.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.040]   And it's funny.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.280]   Pick a book, pick two books, go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.760]   Sign up for the platinum account.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.320]   You won't pay anything for the first 30 days.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:49.240]   In fact, if you cancel in the first 30 days, a problem, you'll know you pay nothing, but
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.640]   you get to keep those books forever.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.400]   So that's nice.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.400]   We love it.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.680]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.400]   I should probably read this.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.720]   This is Olive Kitridge.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:06.120]   This is the new HBO miniseries that's coming out Monday and Tuesday, a Pulitzer Prize winning
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.040]   novel.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.600]   And I like to read the books before I see the movies.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.520]   I'm still haven't seen Gone Girl because I haven't finished the book yet.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.080]   I want the book to be the spoiler, not the movie.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.080]   That's how much I love Audible Audible.com/twit2.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.040]   Give it a try.
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.120]   Good day.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.440]   Chris Breen, Rafe Needleman.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.680]   We're talking high tech.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.840]   Verizon.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:40.520]   And now I think AT&T have been caught setting perma cookies.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:46.400]   A Wired magazine calls it a privacy killing machine.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.200]   This has been going on for two years.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:56.480]   If you use a Verizon phone and you surf using your browser on any phone, a unique identifier
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:03.680]   will be sent to the website that advertisers can use to identify you.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:10.400]   I presume Verizon can use it in some way.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:15.640]   Jacob Hoffman Andrews at the Electronic Frontier Foundation said ISPs, and in this case Verizon
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.440]   would be your ISP, are trusted connectors of users.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.840]   They shouldn't be modifying our traffic on the way to the internet.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.080]   But now we know that AT&T is doing it too, and I wouldn't be surprised if all the carriers
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.080]   are doing it.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.760]   And maybe even your internet service provider.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.480]   Yeah, it's not what we expected.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.720]   That's exactly what I expected.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.320]   Are you kidding me?
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.600]   Yeah, good point.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   It's very sad.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.320]   So what they're doing is they're taking your calls to the internet and your request this
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:53.120]   page and just adding a little identifier that's not just your IP, but a machine identifier.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.120]   Right.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:58.240]   No, it's not like they're giving information to these guys, but every time you go to this
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.920]   page they see it's you again.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920]   Right.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.000]   Well, you start to correlate that with all the places that you have been.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   That's right.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   And you put that in.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.440]   So the ad services can, they're the people who actually link all the stuff together.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.440]   Right.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.280]   People in the Yahoo, that's what the ad companies do.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.280]   Right.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.840]   And they know who you are for all the different places you've been through these cross site
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   cookies.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.120]   And this is just that job so much easier.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:27.040]   According to Verizon, there's no way to turn it off.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:32.360]   She says, the Verizon's spokesman, Deborah Lewis, says, "Forizon doesn't use this UIH
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.160]   to create customer profiles."
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.160]   Oh, goodness.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.160]   Oh, it's just fine.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.040]   Why do they have it then?
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.040]   What's the point of this?
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.480]   If it's not to sell us who are advertising friends?
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:49.600]   Well, the funny thing is even if Verizon isn't taking advantage of it, there's nothing to
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.040]   stop any other ad network from taking advantage of it.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:57.800]   And in effect, they're doing this for the good of the advertising agencies.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.880]   I mean, everybody benefits.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.080]   You're right.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:08.640]   I think ultimately Verizon wants to, but the irony is even if Verizon doesn't, anybody
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.640]   else...
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.640]   Why would they do it?
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.640]   Because they can't.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:17.000]   It's easier to do it than not do it if you're a company like Verizon.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.800]   We spent a lot of time talking about worried about the NSA and worried about Google and
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.800]   Facebook.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.840]   But I always want to point out that it's your internet service provider that really is the
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.600]   risk here because they know everything.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.320]   And they can do stuff like this easily.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.320]   It's trivial.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:35.320]   Whether that's your carrier or your home internet service provider, they can do this.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:41.480]   And you've got to think that Comcast is not exactly motivated to protect my privacy.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:46.560]   Well, it depends on how you look at it.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:52.440]   I mean, if a carrier is cavalier with your privacy, they will lose customers.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.040]   If people find out, I think Verizon figured out nobody will ever notice this.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.680]   Well, it shows how stupid they are.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.080]   They did do it for two years.
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.080]   This stuff, right?
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.840]   And people eventually find out.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:09.240]   Whether you're a carrier, an ad-serving company, or the NSA, eventually people find out this
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.720]   stuff comes out.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:20.760]   So you can't just throw tracking stuff without disclosing it into traffic, into the web.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.760]   It'll come out.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.560]   But the question is, how upset will consumers be?
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.160]   First of all, will they understand what you're talking about, what people are talking about
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.680]   when they reveal this?
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.680]   And then how much of a human cry will there be?
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.680]   It depends.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.120]   Well, I think we've all been worn down at this point.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.560]   People are pretty cynical about it.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.520]   And we figure, well, if they're not doing it, everybody else is going to do it.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.320]   So do I really want to go through the trouble of getting out of my contract with Verizon,
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.600]   going with somebody else or changing the ISPs?
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.600]   Because I don't think there's anybody that anyone trusts anymore.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.520]   And we figured that's just the way the world is today.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.040]   I think it's a sad testament.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.520]   But I do think that people are just kind of worn down and just figured, well, you know,
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.520]   they're still privacy anymore.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.520]   What are you going to do?
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   What are you going to do?
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.920]   The real, I think the benefit to Verizon, even if they don't use it, is that they could
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:12.200]   sell, they know a lot of personal information about you because you had to give them your
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:18.320]   social security number, your name, address, they know all that stuff as a customer.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.840]   Now, well, the ad networks have the UIDH.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:30.400]   But if maybe we did a thing where you tell us the UIDH and we'll tell you the guy's name
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.240]   and for a buck, it's just a buck.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.640]   So that you can see where this nexus could be very bad.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.360]   FCC, though, is going to jump right in and protect us, right?
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.000]   FCC is considering actually what might be a good, I think, on the face of it.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.200]   Now I have not delved deep into it, which means I haven't listened to all the smart
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:56.160]   people like Coria Doctorow and others, but the FCC is considering what they call a hybrid
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.120]   regulatory approach to net neutrality.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.960]   Remember, the FCC has been trying to find a way through this.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.600]   We've talked an awful lot about it.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:10.360]   Some people say the FCC should adopt Title III regulation of Internet service providers,
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:15.400]   call them common carriers, and then they would have the right to regulate them.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.840]   Others say, well, that is going to just kill, or Title II, not Title III, it's of the Communications
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.280]   Act of 1934, it's going to kill, you know, having this kind of heavy duty government
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.800]   oversight is just going to kill the Internet.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.800]   And by the way, there's not even any agreement on places like the EFF where there's a lot
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.960]   of debate, should, who should protect us?
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:43.320]   We agree that we need net neutrality, but should we expect lawmakers to do that?
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.920]   We know not particularly sophisticated, sometimes ham-handed.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.760]   They might do a worse job than no regulation at all.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.880]   So the chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, who is, I've never considered our friend considering
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:02.520]   he comes from the cable and wireless industries before he was made chairman of the FCC, has
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:09.960]   actually come up with something interesting, a split-the-baby approach to net neutrality,
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:22.600]   a hybrid approach in which they would use Title II for wholesale transactions.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:29.680]   So this is complicated to explain, but remember the Netflix kerfuffle where Netflix was basically
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.040]   slowed down by Comcast because Comcast just didn't spend money on their interconnect.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.480]   It let the connection between Netflix and Comcast become congested and eventually got
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:43.160]   Netflix to give them some money.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.840]   Well we need the money for a better router.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.880]   Can you just give us a few million dollars for the better router a month?
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.440]   And they gave them the money and now all of a sudden there's no congestion anymore.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.760]   So that's the interconnect, that's the wholesale Internet business.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.840]   And then of course there's the retail business between me and Comcast.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.080]   So what the FCC is considering is regulating the wholesale transaction but not regulating
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.120]   the retail transaction.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:17.040]   Keep an eye on these interconnects to make sure there are no toll lanes on the Internet,
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.160]   which is one of the key concerns I think we all have, but not get government regulation
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.520]   into how the Internet service provider works with the consumer.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.080]   Good idea?
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.080]   Is it too early to know?
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.080]   It's early to know.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:38.960]   I don't like the idea of the retail side of my relationship with letting the ISPs monkey
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.440]   with toll lanes or not toll lanes.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.800]   It's not an accident that I put these two stories together.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.320]   Yeah, my point out.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.080]   Between me and my ISP.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.840]   Now if my ISP is protected from being charged more for particular traffic than other traffic
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:03.400]   by the big interconnects, great for them, but I kind of want the same production.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.360]   Well and that's what some privacy advocates have said, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.120]   You should have title two across the board.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:12.720]   I do worry and I have heard from a lot of people who say, well, government regulation
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.200]   can be so heavy handed it may not be appropriate in this case.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.720]   They move slowly.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:26.960]   Well, the concern I have is that this can change from administration to administration
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:27.960]   in terms of enforcement.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.760]   They can have these things on the book and say, yes, we can regulate you under title
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.680]   two.
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:39.080]   But let's say an administration comes in that's very friendly to big business and to lobbyists
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:44.440]   for these big ISPs and say, well, you know, you say it's kind of up to your discretion.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:50.200]   Well, we know that you would like us to be more of a free market and therefore get away
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.440]   with some of this stuff.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:57.200]   And so even under title two, I am a little concerned if there aren't some fairly hard
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.440]   and fast rules that somebody can say, no, you've crossed that line that we're going
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440]   to be in trouble.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:06.560]   If it really is just discretionary, depending on how they happen to feel or who's in power
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.240]   at that time.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:13.240]   It's a very tricky technical issue.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.360]   I'm glad the FCC is considering alternatives.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.840]   I'm thrilled to hear that they're at least considering some title two regulation.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.800]   I wish there was, I wish the market was free enough that then we wouldn't have to worry
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:28.800]   that the consumers would be able to call the shots.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.960]   If you had choice, yeah, this wouldn't be a problem.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:31.960]   But most of us.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.960]   It's really sad about this.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:39.960]   Yeah, it's that it's that we, one way or the other, the government has to say something
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:42.680]   about this either we're going to do this or we're not going to do this, but they have
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680]   to be a part of it.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.520]   Or encourage, or encourage competition in some way.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.160]   Maybe there's some way to facilitate competition.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.400]   That always works when the government tries to encourage.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.080]   We're going to take a break.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.320]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com, the place to go instead of the post office
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.080]   so that you can print your own postage anytime you want.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.680]   When it's really for, I got to tell you, if you do mailing in your business, if you send
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.560]   up brochures, flyers, you send out bills or especially if you send out products, if you're
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:14.400]   an Etsy or eBay seller or an Amazon seller, you got to check out stamps.com.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.240]   It makes you look more professional.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.240]   It saves you time.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:22.480]   It saves you money because you print postage for any letter, any package, anytime with
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:26.600]   your computer, your printer, you don't need a postage meter.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.320]   You can print right on the envelopes, your logo, the return address, pre-populated.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.760]   They'll even pull the recipient's address from the webpage or from your QuickBooks or
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.240]   your address book.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:40.840]   We've got this great digital scale that comes with your no risk trial offer that automatically
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.760]   they make sure you got exactly the right postage.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   Have you ever done that?
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.760]   I used to do that.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.000]   Put extra postage on because you don't want to return.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.720]   It's a waste of money.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.040]   Or have you ever had mail returned?
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.840]   I get mail all the time that's postage due.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.840]   That's crazy.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.400]   Stamps.com, folks.

[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.240]   Actually, I don't see the microphone.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.720]   There it is in the upper right hand corner.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.880]   If you don't see a microphone, go back to stamps.com front page, click the microphone,
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:22.880]   enter to it.

[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.760]   Stamps.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.080]   Actually, prisco, I bet you get me anyway.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.080]   Stamps.com.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.800]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.200]   I tried.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.000]   No more trips to the post office.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.320]   $110 offer.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.000]   And of course, you get the month of stamps.com.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.840]   Give it a try.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:53.840]   Stamps.com.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.280]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.240]   The 20th anniversary of the banner ad.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:05.280]   That's a sad, sad commemoration.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.840]   Did you see the world's first--
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.080]   Oh, come on, man.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.800]   Hey, without that, what would--
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.080]   Have you seen this ad?
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:13.160]   This was the first banner ad.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.440]   This was on-- remember Hotwire?
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.400]   So that's the ugly-- that is an ugly bit.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.720]   That really does not bode well for the future of the internet right there.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.840]   You've got to start somewhere.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.800]   Punch the monkeys next, right?
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.080]   Where is this story?
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.080]   Let me go back.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.520]   I just lost it.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.640]   Hotwire was trying to figure out a way to, I guess, make some money.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.240]   This is from the internet history podcast.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:48.200]   And they decided that, well, maybe we could put ads on our site.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:59.440]   Actually, this was one of 12 to 14 banners, which all went live October 27, 1994.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.240]   And Hotwire.com launched.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:01.920]   I remember Hotwire.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.840]   Well, that was like a news site.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.360]   It was Wired's online news site, right?
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.640]   It was good.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.560]   Did you work there?
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.200]   No, no, no.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.720]   I worked at CNET in--
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.280]   In that year?
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.160]   In '96.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:12.800]   '96.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.760]   So when I started--
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.880]   I was doing radio by then, talk.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.280]   I was doing the Vorac on computers.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.600]   So I remember this.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:23.240]   '94, most people weren't even online at that point.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:25.560]   I think that's when we put byte.com online.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.640]   Bites.com.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.200]   '94, '95, yeah.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.360]   Yep.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.360]   So we're listening to the internet history podcast, the first banner ad.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.040]   And I think one of the guys on the podcast was actually the guy who thought it up.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.000]   So you can boo him when he comes on stage.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:51.200]   I think we've done most of these stories in the past here.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.080]   I don't want to bring back old stories.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.600]   Kim Kardashian.
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.880]   That's all I have to say about that.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.880]   That's enough.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.800]   That was a good interview with Cara Swisher.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.200]   There was an interesting body language.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.360]   O'Caro was facing one land.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.120]   Arms folded.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:15.080]   We were hoping to get Cara out to talk about that, but she couldn't make it.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.080]   Do we have a big week ahead?
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.680]   Let's take a look.
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.760]   Mr. Michael.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:24.800]   "Quallcom reports earnings on Wednesday, November 5th, and AOL will do the same on Thursday,
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.040]   November 6th.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.480]   Also on Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned something called the Community Q&A,
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.720]   where he'll essentially hold a Reddit-style AMA for one hour.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.560]   Anyone can submit questions on Zuckerberg's blog post announcing the event and the session
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.400]   will be streamed live.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.760]   That's what's coming up this week, Leo.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.760]   Back to you.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:45.120]   Mike Galgian in our tech news today, every Monday through Friday, 10 AM.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.480]   We have two news shows at every Monday through Friday, by the way.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:50.720]   I want you to know if you're interested in tech news, you can keep up with it.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:57.000]   10 AM Pacific, that's 1 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC Monday through Friday, and then in the
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.840]   afternoon, it's Sarah Lane with Tech News Tonight, 4 PM Pacific, 7 PM Eastern time, and
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.440]   that would be 2400 right at midnight UTC.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:11.320]   If you want to get your daily dose of tech news, I want to thank Mr. Christopher Breen
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320]   of Macworld.com.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.320]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.360]   So, we have to see the hair of Breen and the body of Breen.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.360]   There it is.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.840]   So, body of Breen is your Twitter account.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.120]   Yes, I'm body of Breen.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.520]   I am not hair of Breen.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.840]   There is somebody else who's hair of Breen.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:25.840]   I don't know who that is.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.040]   You do not have control of the hair.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.400]   I have no control of the hair.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.400]   It just does this.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.400]   I wake up in the morning and this is what happened.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.400]   Doesn't it?
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.120]   It looks like his hair might have a Twitter account, actually.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.120]   No, it should.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.280]   I think it's doing stuff at night.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.640]   I know nothing about it.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.280]   It's great to see you, Christopher.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.320]   I'm glad you survived the massive layoffs at Macworld.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.120]   If anybody should still be there, it's you.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.120]   I don't know.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.280]   Is that a bad thing to say?
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280]   It's like a...
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.280]   I don't know.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.680]   No, I'm glad to be there.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.280]   I mean, we're really kind of working like a startup.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.760]   It's really interesting.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.920]   We have a lot more freedom than we did in the past.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.920]   So, it's more work.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.640]   It's harder work, but so far it's been pretty rewarding.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:10.080]   People should go to Macworld.com and not assume it's gone because there's great stuff.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:13.360]   There is still a monthly digital edition of Macworld magazine.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.960]   So, good stuff.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:16.960]   Chris is doing great work.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:17.960]   It's gone by.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.960]   Macalope's still there.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.960]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.600]   Love Mr. Macalope.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:29.320]   We also want to thank Ralph Needleman who's doing a great job at Yahoo Tech Tech.yahoo.com.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:30.320]   This is...
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.320]   Let's face it.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:36.720]   This is why Macworld and many other magazines have ceased to print is because this is a
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.200]   magazine on the web.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.200]   It's great.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.200]   It's up.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.200]   We're doing...
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.200]   I mean, it's beautiful.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.800]   David Pogues there with his videos, Pogues Basics.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:50.520]   You're saying you're kind of targeting this for the normal person.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.960]   It's tech for everybody.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:56.920]   I mean, technology is not reserved for just nerds in the tech bubble.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:57.920]   Right.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:58.920]   Not anymore.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.200]   And everybody is a newbie at something, right?
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.200]   Right.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:04.560]   That's why we have the new Pogues Basics series, little things that you should know that you
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.800]   just assume that everybody knows what they don't.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.160]   My mom, for example, I just gave her my old iPhone 5.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.880]   I got the iPhone 6.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.960]   And you think that these phones are also very intuitive, but there's so much undocumented
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.320]   stuff, all the gestures and the secrets and all that stuff.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.280]   And I'm realizing and trying to teach her how to use this phone that it's going to take
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.320]   a year before she's fast-hiled on this thing.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:30.320]   So that's why we have Pogues Basics just to help people kind of do the little things,
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.040]   like just squeeze the phone to stop it from ringing.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.840]   You'll hit a button and it'll stop ringing.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:35.840]   Just squeeze it.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.840]   Something will happen.
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:38.360]   You'll hit a button and it'll shut off.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360]   I never thought of that.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360]   It works.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.960]   By the way, Becky Worley does great stuff for you.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.200]   This is her review of the Pavlock, which is...
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:54.680]   Some evil genius, some sick, whatever, managed to take a fitness band and put a shocker,
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.960]   like a dog collar shocker in it.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.080]   So if you don't meet your goal, if you don't walk enough, first it'll beep and then it'll
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:05.800]   buzz you and then it will actually zap you.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.600]   And Becky tried this?
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.840]   You know, journalism is not all cupcakes and caviar, man.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.680]   Look at this.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.680]   It looks like it hurts.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:15.680]   Wow.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.680]   She says, "Whoa!"
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:22.640]   One of the few people I know who can look absolutely gorgeous while getting shocked by
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:23.640]   her wristwatch.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.640]   Fun.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.640]   Yeah, Becky's one of mine.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640]   I know one of your stalwarts there.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640]   That's great.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.640]   Oh, she's great.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.640]   It's a good video.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640]   She almost smacked herself in the face with that thing.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640]   Becky does these from her kitchen.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.560]   But the power of the device is when it's at full power.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.560]   She was a nun for Halloween.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:39.560]   Did you see the picture?
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.560]   I saw her Facebook picture.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.200]   It actually was kind of...
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.200]   She looked good.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.200]   None the wiser.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.200]   I thought, none the wiser.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.480]   We want to thank you for joining us.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.840]   We do this show this week in tech every Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.760]   Now, we did that stupid daylight saving thing.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:02.120]   And so we set our clocks back an hour.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:09.320]   So while we are still at the same time for us, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, that
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.040]   is now an hour later UTC.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.040]   So it is...
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.480]   I have to do the math.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:21.680]   3 plus 12 is 15 plus 8 is 2300 UTC.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.560]   You're going to have to do the math figure out what that is in your time zone.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.560]   Okay?
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.560]   Thank you for being here.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.160]   If you can't make it live, we do love it if you're here live.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.880]   But if you can't make it live, you can always watch on demand audio and video available at
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:38.680]   twit.tv or wherever podcasts are aggregated, stored and disseminated like iTunes.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:41.360]   Probably your phone has a dozen ways to get it stitcher.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.680]   And there's some great Twit apps too.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.280]   You can put on your smartphone or your Roku box.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:46.280]   We hope you do that.
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:50.200]   If you want to be here in studio, we've got five people who did not pass out.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.200]   Six.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.200]   Sorry.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.200]   Six.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.200]   The rest are gone.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.200]   You can email tickets@twit.tv.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.480]   We'll put a very uncomfortable chair out for you.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.480]   You like the chair?
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:00.480]   It's good.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:01.480]   You feeling all right?
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.480]   Thanks for being here.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:03.480]   We'll see you next time.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.480]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.480]   Bye bye everybody.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:06.480]   [applause]
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:07.480]   [music]
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:08.480]   [applause]
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:15.480]   [music]
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.480]   Baby
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.480]   Alright. You look great, man.
