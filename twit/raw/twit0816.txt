[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.280]   Two well three if you include me because we've got two of my favorite people on
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.680]   Amy Webb is here from the future today Institute
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.160]   I honestly think we could just do a show with just Amy. She's so full of information and your brand new
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.200]   14th annual
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.040]   Tech trends report is out. So we'll certainly be talking about that. Hi Amy
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.880]   Hey Liam good Pesach happy Passover. Thank you. I said it in Yiddish is it good to Pesach?
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.680]   It's a good I don't know if it's like a good thing. I mean we're all alive so that we made it the favorite
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   And we made it had some had some horror set and some
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.760]   Do you do the whole stator thing do you hide the affocommen the matzah and do all that?
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.960]   Yeah, we do the whole thing we do the whole thing and
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.600]   We put it so if you don't know that that's we you hide a cracker when you explain these things out loud
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.000]   Not nothing makes sense. It all sounds really horrible
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.760]   But there's a part in all of this where you hide a cracker and then everybody has to go look for
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.640]   We put it in a pretty obvious place, but everybody overthought it our carpet got ripped up
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.000]   How many kids were there because only the kids are supposed to read yeah three
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.880]   It's fun out totally separately because this is weird. So yeah, basically like to break
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.440]   It's a long service. So like kids go out they they look for it
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.000]   They come back but my husband's family I found out did it in this really messed up way
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.280]   this their tradition was that the kids hide it and the adults have to go find it and in order to restart the service the
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.120]   The they have to barter and the kids have to get from the
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.560]   Award yeah really messed up
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.720]   Really stop so it's it's long the service is long enough
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.760]   The haggada that you go that you do is long enough most people that's their biggest complaint about Passover
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   Yeah, I don't think you should make it longer
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.400]   No, and the kids know that so they're like you want to wrap this up. You got to give me something
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.440]   Let me see if I could find this part of the Red Sea Shanty that describes the Afro Conan
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   Oh my god for real I did not see this
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:58.320]   This is a
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:07.720]   Israeli a cappella singing group called 613 they do every every every every Jewish holiday they do a weird song
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   This is their Red Sea Shanty
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.360]   That's pretty hilarious. That's how I've learned everything. I know about that so first from these guys
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.520]   And also want to welcome Kevin Rose back. He's the original twit by the way
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.800]   You were on twit episode zero twit episode one and I don't know maybe the first hundred twits great to see you
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.040]   Good. Just good to see you Leo. Thanks for having me
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.240]   Venture capitalists with true ventures. He's got a brand new podcast. I want to give you a plug right up front
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.720]   Mo Phi the modern finance podcast you're only in your you've only done three episodes only two published so far
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.880]   But the first one is a must listen I listen to it immediately
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.860]   Because I am completely baffled by this whole crazy NFT thing
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.520]   We've spent a lot of time talking about the people's
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.040]   $69 million
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   art
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.480]   JPEG sold at Christie's
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.920]   But you explained it all very well with I am DC investor off top hot saying
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.120]   Who was it was you know, I knew I guess you're also an investor. You've bought some NFTs
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.320]   Yeah, I mean I was definitely dabbling way back when crypto punks first came out which was
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:26.720]   Probably well that was before the the standard was actually defined so they weren't they weren't actually enough teas at first were they?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.040]   That's right. Yeah, the standard was based on the work done with the crypto punks project
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.600]   Oh interesting. So they were so you're smart. I heard you say that you sold
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.080]   This is these are the crypto punks. They are 25 by 25 pixels. Yeah, they're icons of zombies, right?
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.520]   Other things zombie is one at attribute type. Yes, and
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:58.040]   Aliens zombies and yeah, they all have different mohawks and glasses and beard types and I mean, but you bought but you buy these
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.800]   I'm which I don't understand because I see them all right here. I have them all you
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.880]   You buy them so that if I if I click on the smiling zombie, which apparently you own
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.840]   I can look at it. I could print it. I could do anything. I want with it, but you own it
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.300]   That's right. Yeah, you could do the same thing with the get a high res copy of the Mona Lisa and print it out
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.080]   That's true house, but but you don't have it. That's true
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.280]   So it's like you got the Mona Lisa of smiling zombies
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.920]   Yeah, I mean it's basically just a way to use the blockchain to prove that someone actually has ownership over something that makes a lot of sense
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.480]   An ownership that makes a lot of sense. I'm ending it in the blockchain
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.260]   That's a real problem with artworks with baseball cards with a collectible is
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.200]   distribution and who owns it, but also is it real is it and so blockchain
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.080]   Yeah, and the third piece that's really important is how many were made?
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.680]   I mean one of the things that that happened in the the 90s around baseball cards and collectibles and comic books is
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.160]   You know, there's a there's a great story
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.520]   We all of course know the the very famous franchise of the Wolverine and the very first Wolverine comic is still
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.800]   $50 and I dug into this I'm like how this was made in the 80s
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.040]   How can this possibly be and it turns out they printed like something like 300,000 of them and didn't tell anyone?
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.480]   He sold as many as they could and which makes sense as a business
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.200]   But as collectors, you didn't know that you know and so the blockchain gives you a way to say proof and scarcity
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.000]   Ownership so that's that's nice. So there is another way
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.480]   biological way to
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.080]   barcode and to track authenticity in that's DNA so you can spray
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:47.360]   Custom DNA on just about anything. It's odorless. It's colorless. It leaves no residue. It leaves no mark
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.520]   And then you have physical so blockchain is great, but you know
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.920]   It's not physical way in fact. Yeah, I mean yeah
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:02.280]   The crypto punk is not in the blockchain right the image itself is not in the blockchain Kevin just the URL
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.680]   That's not true because the with crypto punks it was only a 25 by 25
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.040]   Oh, they're so small you could put it a hash of the yeah exactly
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:16.520]   You're right in any modern like the people's all that stuff. It is just a pointer to like an IPFS type
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.120]   You know asset right well at least it's I know problems
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.280]   Go ahead. I was gonna say I think all of that works well as long as you have a ton of redundancy built in
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.360]   Yeah, cuz if it's just if we're a web you are elegant
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   You know the server go down at least with IPFS is a distributed file system and so in theory it's not gonna go away
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.880]   You could spray DNA
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.880]   So I'm not gonna ask you
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.680]   It's probably it's not the traditional method of spraying DNA. I'm assuming it's some other
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.400]   I know that's not what I was talking about. Okay, that's where my mind went
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   It's a sneeze right you sneeze on it. I'm sure if you think about it that probably a few van goes have his DNA on them
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.960]   But you're not talking about that
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.600]   No, I'm not talking about that. I am you know one of the really cool things that's happened
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   One of the positive after effects of the virus is that messenger RNA, which has been around forever
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.160]   It finally found a use case a business case
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.360]   To make the vaccines in this case
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.960]   That's right and mRNA is is a pretty cool technology
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.440]   That has some knock-on of effects and one of which is looking at
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.680]   RNA and DNA in sort of a new light so
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.840]   You can DNA is like nature's hard drive. You can store a ton of stuff in it
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.720]   And it doesn't go anywhere
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.520]   And likewise you can use DNA as a tracking system
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.720]   So if you've got a really valuable collection of comic books not Wolverine
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.080]   But something else more valuable, you know one way to physically mark products like that
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:04.720]   artifacts that you cannot authenticate in the future is using DNA fragments one of the advantages of blockchain in this regard is it's distributed and
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.240]   Everybody has a copy. There's no with DNA
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.960]   You'd still have to have some
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:18.320]   registry somewhere of what that what's what's what's in that RNA if I mean it doesn't have to be RNA it could be any
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.760]   coding method for encoding a long digit
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.320]   Right, I mean it's like a you can encode spores - it's just it's like a barcode
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.520]   But yes, you would still need or you would still need a registry that should be distributed
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   That works great for like individual objects
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.680]   But if you're going to do something like say fractional and ownership of a digital object. Oh, you can't do that impossible
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.720]   You know smart contracts enable things like artworks to change over time based on rulesets
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.400]   Like like really kind of fun things like that as well are are pretty cool with some of the NFT stuff
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.280]   I think people and I include myself in this get distracted
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.920]   by
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.440]   Trying to wrap their mind around well people made a JPEG
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:06.760]   Which is infinitely reproducible and then was able to sell it for 69.3 million dollars
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:14.680]   To somebody who now can claim ownership in some abstract way and we get wrapped around this notion of collectible
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.760]   physical versus virtual objects and all of that and
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.400]   You know you can go either way on that. I mean, you know, I'm kind of of the opinion
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.480]   It's pretty speculative and but so is so our collectibles
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.880]   I mean you don't buy a hones wagon or baseball car because it has any intrinsic value
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.320]   You buy it because you think either you're really a big fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates or
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.600]   You think it's going to have more value and a down the road and you can sell it
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.520]   It's a way of storing value just like unfortunately a lot of artworks now are ways of storing value. They're not hung on any wall
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.620]   They're stored in a locker at some airport to avoid customs and taxes
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:01.240]   But they are a store of value and you know, you'll be able to sell them at some point probably for more than you paid for it, right?
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.720]   so I
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:10.040]   Acknowledged that this is a good way to this is a better blockchain is a better way to store value, but I think people like me get all
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.680]   Tied in a knot over this. Well, yeah, what are you kids doing? This is this is silly
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.560]   There's also and let me ask you about this Kevin because you didn't address this in modern finance
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.680]   There's also an environmental concern isn't there? I mean there's a lot of energy
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.480]   being used to create these
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.760]   Things and every transaction uses a lot of energy. I think the energy consumption of
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.280]   Proof-of-work blockchain has been known for for quite some time
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.040]   I mean, there's there's it's horrible and so I mean that's why
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.800]   There's a lot of work and effort going into making these chains just eco-friendly
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:54.240]   I mean if you take a look at all the layer two scaling solutions for Ethereum everything is they're doing with optimistic roll-ups
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.240]   these are like very
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.600]   lightweight ways to do
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.200]   Cryptographically proven transfers without affining to write it back to the main chain
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.640]   So without spending a lot of resource power until we get to something that is
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.080]   Proof-of-state, which is not proof-of-work
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.360]   Which is not using very intensive CPU or GPUs to do all these transaction processing which is on the Ethereum roadmap
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.160]   I mean this stuff is coming in for a long time though. Yeah, I know but you're also talking about, you know
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.880]   How many billions of dollars of you have to be very careful when you're when you're
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.840]   Changing directions of a plane of that size, right? Like you if you're if you're setting a new destination
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.600]   Like you don't want you want to really battle and harden the code
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:46.040]   And so you know there's been some you too is like there's they've crossed a couple major milestones and staking is the next big one
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.760]   And that will eliminate the
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.840]   grotesque energy expenditure
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.280]   Yes, and and and there's already other chains out there that like are getting a lot of traction that already green from the get-go
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.640]   Chia Bram Cohen the creator of BitTorrent just launched his coin
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:07.520]   Here just four or five days ago you actually interview him for the efficient green for the podcast. You just interviewed him for the podcast?
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.440]   Yeah, it's a very efficient super green cryptocurrency
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.080]   It's going to have support for smart contracts and other things on top of it
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.720]   Solana super like talk about
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:25.160]   High bandwidth high throughput they can do 50,000 transactions a second and it is super efficient and green
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:32.000]   So, you know these these are all problems that are being worked out, but I certainly acknowledge that today it sucks. I'm of course like
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.060]   Dependent upon where you're getting your energy from like there are a lot of miners that will go next to very cheap
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:46.520]   Sources which can be hydroelectric they can be you know solar and we're not there. They're mining those environments sure sure in fact
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.720]   It only makes sense to mine where electricity is cheap because otherwise you probably not making a profit, right?
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.520]   It kind of brings up the issue of as I saw some wag tweet
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:03.600]   Elon Musk said Tesla now will accept Bitcoin to purchase a Tesla automobile and
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.880]   Of course some wag pointed out that you might as well just put gas engines in a melon because
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.280]   If you're all the benefit the environmental benefit of an electric vehicle is kind of
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.880]   Abrogated by using Bitcoin to pay for him. I mean yes and no
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:25.160]   I think that there's a couple things here like what are the payment rails behind the scenes if you're going let's say
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.360]   I don't know what they're using for on the on the merchant side to accept Bitcoin, but let's just say it's it's Coinbase, right?
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:37.320]   Yeah, if you're going coin based to Coinbase, you're not doing any there's no conversion actually writing to the chain right exactly
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:44.080]   It's just staying within that that family so it depends and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and somebody pointed out
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   That you know, there's there's not inconsiderable energy usage in banking as well. I mean, you know
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.320]   We use a lot of energy for a lot of things including Google searches and we don't pay much attention to that
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.200]   And that we've got to pay attention to it all soon. Yeah. Yeah, because it's not it's not sustainable in the long run
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.480]   All right, oh
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:13.400]   Hey, okay as long as we're talking about this one more question for you because we we're talking about Bitcoin purchases
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:20.360]   Tesla's on the radio show with Samable Sam and our car guy and he said, you know people should consider the tax consequences if
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.400]   The Bitcoin gets converted into dollars
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.280]   The IRS is gonna want capital gains tax on
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   The difference between the basis and and what you what that Bitcoin was worth when you converted is that right?
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.240]   That's right. They pay attention. They're gonna be short of long-term cap gains depending on how long you've held it for right?
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.000]   So only spend your first Bitcoin not your last
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.160]   Right first and first out is that possible? I guess it is
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.840]   Yeah, that's well the accounting software does that you know, yeah
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:18:00.320]   Do you cover this in your new report on trends this has to be part of the way the world is sure to do chaining
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.040]   Yeah, yeah
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.840]   So right so we produce a future today Institute has for 14 years put out an annual tech trends report
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.600]   They're longitudinal and quantitative. So
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.400]   He's 10 not to be flashes in the pan, which is why we really wrestled with what to do this year around NFTs
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.440]   because I
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   It's hard to know and I
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.880]   Think I think the NFT is the modality of something different. I don't think that's that's the thing
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:34.640]   I think the thing is about how value is held digitally and this is just the current modality, but
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.400]   But yeah, so it's it's we have a there were so many aftershocks because of COVID that we wound up with
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.120]   22% more
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.040]   22% increase in the number of trends that we cover
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.960]   So so we we crossed the 500 mark this year and in trends and
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.720]   So we just we broke them up and and wrote of 12 separate reports
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.440]   so there is an entire report just on cryptos and blockchains and
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.880]   DLTs a FinTech report. Yep. I'm looking at it right now. There by the way, nice little sketch of you Amy
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.960]   Thanks, we have we work with a really amazing talented
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.400]   artist who's a futurist named Julia Durgy and and she did
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   The hander on illustrations and our creative I should have brought the calendar you guys sent out in because it's really wonderful
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.720]   Each month is a different illustrator in a different concept and it's it's pretty cool. Yeah, thanks
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:39.080]   All right, I don't I I don't even I know I know so I understand this so poorly that I don't even know what questions to ask so
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.200]   maybe we'll just we'll just move on
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.640]   Is there
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:52.920]   These are a current manifestation, but you say it's a manifestation of something deeper I do and let's also so crypto kitties was what?
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.200]   2017 my
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.080]   My year so kitties. Yeah, I remember them. There's still around by the way. You can still buy a crypto kitty
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.800]   Sure, but I my point is and then you know
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:10.440]   It's good. It's good to remember went it's good to think about the factors that are contributing to excitement when it bursts
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.280]   Like it is right now in the space. So part of it is people are trapped inside
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.080]   And they it's perfect for quarantine. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:25.280]   So that's the first thing second thing is this is not the first time we've seen this this is at least the second and so
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.520]   As far as I'm you know the work that we do weren't we're usually not looking at the very first thing
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   We're looking at the offshoots of that first thing
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.040]   And and then what is the thing so the the conversation about NFTs
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   and Ethereum are related and and you know
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.480]   Not trying to buy a Tesla with a bit Bitcoin
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.800]   They're they're all related and and all of these things have to do with how we
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.640]   create and store value in a way that
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.760]   In a way that makes sense over a long period of time
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   And so that's what's happening. So right now everybody is pretty excited about
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:11.360]   Digital art and that may shift to something else and it may shift to something else
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:18.040]   But ultimately the underlying current here is how how value gets exchanged using new new tech
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.360]   Eventually I would imagine
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.920]   Blockchain or something like it will replace centralized ledger systems
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:34.800]   You know, I guess I was at weft what 2018 my or maybe it was 2017 I forget the year
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.280]   You know
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.040]   Cryptos tied to fiat currency tied to
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.560]   National initiatives was being talked about a lot
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.160]   So and you know China's was talking about throwing some of its sovereign wealth fund at its own version of
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.160]   a national crypto so and
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.240]   Singapore's had some sort of nation-state experiments already
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:04.360]   So I think that this is just like many things right? This is a this is a change a fundamental change
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.760]   That'll just you know, sort of take some time to sort out
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.560]   Yeah, we've very seen national banks in many countries including our own
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.960]   Say yeah stable coin because we don't want the volatility
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.280]   But stable coin is going to be okay for something
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.980]   I don't we do we will we ever have a crypto based
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.880]   Currency in a national currency
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.800]   Is that gonna happen I
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:41.000]   Lived in China when I lived in Hong Kong when there were two currencies
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.320]   There were two different banknotes issued one was HSBC and the other one was some that the I forget the other one
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.720]   Bank of China and it was kind of a pain in the neck so I
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.280]   Don't I don't know that I want lots of different currency types ones enough
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.240]   Well, the question is Kevin kind of brought this up a moment ago
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:10.320]   But like what would it make what would it take for something like that to work and the back end processing that you would need?
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.760]   You know think of how long it took the United States just to get to contactless payment
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.400]   Right and we're still not there
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.000]   No, here's a crazy statistic. I was just talking to somebody who's a
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.760]   banking executive and
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.920]   Fewer than 10 percent. It's a it's single digits
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:35.280]   It's a very very low number of the people in the United States who use Apple pay even though the penetration rate of iPhones is quite high
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.960]   So we're just we're just not we're not there
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:44.440]   It's hard for those of us in the bubble and probably all three of us are in the bubble and certainly most of our listeners
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.320]   To understand that because I use Apple pay for every moment. I can
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.360]   online and in real world stores
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:00.040]   But it just seems so obvious and convenient. I mean we will have to have a national digital currency
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.920]   Like there's no doubt. I mean, that's the future. Why we're just gonna keep you're just gonna keep paper forever
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:11.560]   Like it's just kind of gonna it's it's it's already happened and that we have a stable coin that that represents the dollar and that works
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:19.520]   Is it expensive on Ethereum? Yes, is it expensive on salon? Oh, no, and it's the same stable coin is say, you know backed by Coinbase
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.080]   They're doing the all the bookkeeping for that, but I would imagine the US government has to eventually issue a
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.520]   National digital currency. I mean that's China's working on it. They're gonna do it
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:37.120]   And then also I mean what better way to attack the the value of the dollar
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.560]   Than for Russia and China and you know other countries to buy up Bitcoin
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.880]   I mean and try and create a global standard that is not the dollar. Oh interesting
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.160]   I mean, it's already happening like for the first time in Q4 of last year
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.240]   We saw more institutional money going into buying Bitcoin than retail for the first time
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.600]   That's massive and you think Tesla is gonna stop and of course not it's gonna
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:06.280]   Are you think Tesla's gonna be the only one and square? It's gonna be Google buying it Amazon buying it like more and more
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.400]   institutions wealthy family offices like hedge funds. They're all gonna be buying up this crypto and
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.000]   I don't know. I just have a feeling governments are not far behind and when that happens
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   It's it's game on like if that's that's war against the dollar, which is gonna get really crazy
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.400]   is it politically difficult to because
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.760]   There are certain look
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.840]   There are a lot of people out there who think the vaccine is gonna insert a chip in your arm that Bill Gates is gonna
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:38.080]   use to follow you around there's clearly a lot of people especially in the United States who are very skeptical of
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.000]   Anything that's not printed on paper, right?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.160]   And and I think the notion of cash and the anonymity of the true anonymity of cash and all that
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.000]   drives a lot of people I
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.040]   Think politically it might be difficult to to persuade people to give up cash
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.240]   It's something you would have to give it up. It would just be it's almost face it out
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.520]   Slow. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean you're there's no money in the bank. I don't have any money in the bank
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.160]   Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't know it's bits. It's bits in the bank. It's bits already
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.680]   Nobody wants to think about that by the way. That's a terrifying fun
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:22.200]   There's the currency and then there's the paint. There's the transaction and then there's the FIs supporting all of it
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.320]   so
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.840]   On the one hand
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:30.720]   So Kevin's absolutely right there. There are actually quite a few countries that are already pushing much further ahead than we are
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   on a
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.960]   National crypto of some kind
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.440]   You know a lot of us just goes back to belief
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.440]   That's what fiat means it's Latin for belief
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.200]   right and so yeah
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.640]   But I was gonna say on the flip side of this so right so in New York
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.600]   I
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.480]   Don't know like two years ago a lot of places stopped taking cash and now they all have to take cash again. So
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   Why do they have to take cash again?
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:08.000]   Because it turns out a lot of people are unbanked or underbanked and they don't have a way to digitally. That's another issue
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.720]   Yeah, right is that that that is being fixed so fast like look at what Square has done there
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.440]   I mean they are just crushing it. But what if you don't even have a smartphone?
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.320]   What do you I mean, you know the price of smartphones and everything. I mean it's just coming down to next to nothing
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:29.280]   It's to get an Android phone and if actually there's there's the data show that there's not a very high
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.320]   correlation between your socio-economic income level and your smartphone adoption
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.040]   Oh meaning people who are on the very low and I still have smartphones
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.200]   Just it's not about money. It's a necessary. Yeah, right?
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.800]   But there are people who are will be left out by a digital transformation aren't there? I
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:54.680]   Don't know what it's to be but the data on that skew more toward people who just don't have that the digital literacy
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:00.600]   So if anything like that people money it's holding back cryptos right now is that people don't quite grok
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   Cryptos right they understand how you get them or use them. So if somebody's listening to this and poo pooing it and saying, uh,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.040]   right
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.920]   It probably behoove you to figure it out now. Yeah start to think about it
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.360]   You think well, I mean the whole thing Amy you're right though
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.320]   There's a lot of people that don't grok and I think that's those the those the rough edges that are being sanded out over the last
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.880]   You know a couple years. I mean the fact that you can go with everybody
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.400]   You know people that have a PayPal account have no idea what crypto is right
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.680]   They can just go in there and with two clicks own cryptocurrency like that that is amazing
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.320]   Like from where we were a few years ago in the world of crypto. It was so hard to set up your own wallet and everything else
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.200]   You had to do to get crypto. I mean in square cash they they do these squares
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.880]   Just been so brilliant here where they do these little these bonuses where they'll say
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.680]   You can go and we'll get we'll send you a debit card. So you get a visa debit card for your square accounts
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.240]   You still don't have a bank account, but someone sent you some square cash your baby's sitting whatever it may be
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:05.000]   You enable one of these little booths boost they call them and they'll say 10% are the next day of 115%
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.160]   Bitcoin back on your coffee shop purchase
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:14.240]   So you go use your visa card and then all of a sudden for the first time you're like wait a second
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.720]   I own Bitcoin now and you click on the tab for the first time and you realize you don't have to have
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   $55,000 to buy Bitcoin you can buy Bitcoin for $2 or $5 and they just make it super simple
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.080]   And it's just the on ramps are getting that much easier for the average consumer
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.600]   Right and it's the use cases
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.120]   It's it's the use case on the spending side that still needs to be worked out
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   And and I think part of the part of the problem with people not paying
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   contactless
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.840]   Is less to do with the individual individual consumer and more to do with merchant merchant services and the terminals
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:53.360]   I just it's taken a really really long time for merchants to switch over their term their POS terminals
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.640]   That's part of the problem. So like it's fine. I mean, I've got a bunch of different
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.520]   I've got I'm holding a bunch of different options, right?
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:08.800]   And I can't do anything not really with any of it one of my friends who's probably listening at some point this week
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.800]   who had had set up a mining operation and built
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:20.760]   He mined enough that I think he bought most of a car with it, but it was it required like multiple
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.880]   Transactions to get to the point where he could complete that purchase. So that's getting easier though. That's Kevin's point is the infrastructure
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.920]   I don't I don't that's one place where I kind of like disagree
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.120]   I don't know that it is getting easier relative to what in order for it to move from fringe to mainstream
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:43.160]   It has to be you have to hit critical mass and and I think there's also a psychological hurdle that might even be more
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.880]   Intractable, but maybe that's because I'm older than you guys, but I think that
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:55.160]   You know, there's also a psychological hurdle to self-driving cars. I don't want to get in that thing. There's no driver. There's no steering wheel
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:01.720]   There's this psychological heart that well who owns this? Where does it exist and how do I know? I'm not getting ripped off
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.120]   Yeah, but nobody understands the fed
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.040]   I mean like that's that's fine. Yeah, but we all do it
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:13.720]   We all do it. So we use somebody must understand it because we all it's time. It's time. It's time
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.920]   It's it's amount of time with an idea because if you stop and ask how does the fed work?
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.640]   How does how does like macroeconomics work? It doesn't your brain will hurt right?
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.600]   People have a rough idea. They say well, they print money. It's slightly inflationary
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.840]   I mean people have a very
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:36.360]   No, people don't understand economics. They have a very rough idea, but there is a sense of security because everybody
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.400]   It's the way we do it. Everybody does it. So you're saying in time
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   It'll be the way we do things and everybody oh yeah fine. That's fine. That's be yeah
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.320]   I I calculated by Thanksgiving dinners like three Thanksgiving dinners ago
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.120]   Like three people were asking me how I think of my Bitcoin now at Thanksgiving dinner
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.200]   Everyone's talking about what's the price gonna go to it?
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.560]   No, everybody already has it. I feel like that's driven by speculation
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.760]   That's driven fundamentally by greed like how do I get in on this so I could be another Bitcoin billionaire
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:11.160]   It's driven by speculation that worries me a little bit. Yeah, and so does the stock market, you know, it's all oh yeah worries me also
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.200]   And by the way, he's considered another asset class
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.000]   I think you know, it's silly to think that this is going away
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.680]   And so for me, it's like what percentage of my overall portfolio does this make up?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:28.040]   Do you diversify into cyber punks crypto punks? That's right. Yeah, and you actually can do that
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.840]   Sneakers, I was gonna say like sneakers are asset classes too. I mean, it's it's yeah
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:38.520]   It's what we it's what we ascribe value to I know I was talking to Christina Warren about her crazy sneaker thing
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.600]   Uh, and she does that whole thing online where they all and it's like
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.720]   I finally feel like my grandfather going I don't get what you kids are up to
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.120]   Is she is she buying?
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.120]   To wear or to resell? Uh, I think she's actually just buying to wear
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.840]   somebody by the way has to buy
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:03.800]   To use as opposed to buy to speculate or the or it just does become completely untethered to reality
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.240]   At some point everything has to have some utility
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.880]   There's no point in having
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   It's it then it's just that's that's the thing with art right?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.240]   You don't I mean the painting I've got hanging up over there doesn't have utility there's utility
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   You at least can look at it
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.160]   Yeah
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.640]   And I agree you can have a perfect copy of the Mona Lisa on your wall and distinguishable from the
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.600]   Original it'd be a lot easier to see it than going to Paris and waiting in line at the Louv
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.280]   Yeah, I'm looking at it from what like what do they make you stand back like 50 feet?
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.480]   Yeah, through like double bulletproof glass. I like to stand there and just watch everybody go. It's so small
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.720]   So you can print it big you can you can make it big
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.080]   And then it'll make you happy. I don't I don't I just I just I feel like
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.520]   This is one of those wild things where
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.800]   Right, so this is what so as a futurist, right? This is a moment when
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.520]   So leo what you're describing right now is what we would call a strong signal
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.240]   Um, so there's enough of a change. It's happened pretty quickly that
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.080]   The best possible thing to do is to stop and ask a whole bunch of questions
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.640]   Um, what is this thing?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.840]   How is this thing having next order impacts already?
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.120]   How does this thing change the value network of you know, whatever it might be?
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.000]   Uh, how does this thing impact my business my portfolio my perception?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.400]   Whatever, you know, um, you got to stop and ask a whole bunch of questions and I think the issue is that there's a
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.200]   Certain amount of knowledge being accumulated
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.520]   um by one end
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.800]   Um of the spectrum of people and everybody else tuning out tuning in like on the morning
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.440]   Talk shows because it's sensationalist sensationalist sounding everybody else tuning out
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   So what you wind up with on the other side of this is a fairly wide gap
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.720]   And knowledge, which is not good either because now you got two deficiencies not only do you not hold cryptos
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.440]   But now you also don't see yeah that much further away from understanding. Yeah. Yeah
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.160]   Soon as the aarp explains it then i'll know
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.760]   We're to take a little break. I am so glad you guys are here because uh, it's always an education
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:20.280]   For me and I hope for all of you as well. Amy web from the future today institute
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.480]   Uh, kevin rose from true ventures and his new podcast modern
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:31.880]   Finance I thought I understood all this I listened to episode one. I thought it all made sense and now i'm confused again
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.080]   After listening another episode
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.040]   I showed it. Thank you both for being here. I showed today
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.960]   Uh brought to you by here's something I understand foreign languages
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.600]   Speaking another tongue. It's it's good for your brain. It's good for you
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.240]   It's great if you like to travel
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.160]   But chances are there are people around you who speak another language
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:59.000]   You'd like to be able to communicate to and i'm going to recommend babble which is the absolute best way
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.640]   To learn a language. I did babble for french and i'm doing babbles for spanish
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.280]   Really useful in california to be able to speak spanish
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.440]   Uh
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.040]   It's the number one selling language learning app and I can tell you exactly

[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.480]   The language classes you took in high school

[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.240]   My aunt's pen but everybody for some reason high school learns la plume de matante
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.320]   Not in babble you learn practical real world phrases
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.560]   You'll use in every day life beginners start with typical greetings like hello
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.920]   How are you and build up to practical dialogues like how can I book a single room?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:00.840]   There's listening. There's speaking. There's flashcards. There's writing here. Let's let's listen to a phrase because
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.280]   Uh
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.960]   Let's see. Let me turn up the sound here. I always turn off my phone

[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:18.920]   This is where every single cryptocurrency project calls their home like they use discord servers every open source project too
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.800]   Yeah, exactly open source projects. It's just it's really gaining a ton of momentum and the
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.560]   How you can extend it in very unique ways with their api
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.880]   Um, there's just some really cool stuff going on there. It's uh, yeah, I'm a huge fan at first
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.280]   I thought it was just gonna be all you know all gaming it started that way
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.480]   It started that way, but it's extended much much further than that now
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.520]   So I'm I think it's a great pickup for them. I don't think they'll get it for 10 billion, but I think it's a no
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:51.320]   In fact, I think what happened? I'm just guessing you might know better because you know how these things work
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.360]   Is that discord is considering an IPO?
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   uh
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.880]   But they thought well, let's float a dollar amount
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.920]   And see if we can get anybody to buy us
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.840]   Uh, and then if not, well, we'll do the IPO and we'll make that much money
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.880]   Anyway, it's interesting though. The reason
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.800]   Microsoft is in the hunt and apparently the
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.760]   Conversations aren't currently ongoing
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:22.440]   But the reason microsoft is in the hunt is very interesting such in adela last month in an interview
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.440]   Said that the future was going to be all about creation
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:32.600]   He said the past technology has been about consumption watching netflix on your ipad for instance
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:38.440]   But that the future lies in creation, which is why microsoft tried to buy tiktok
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.640]   Which is why microsoft tried to buy pinterest and why microsoft is now trying to buy discord
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.240]   Um, I guess I guess that makes sense
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.680]   Um, it wouldn't be the most expensive thing they've bought but one of the most expo'd be right up there
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.400]   I think would be the number two biggest acquisition much more than they spent for no kia or github
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.120]   Um, maybe even like linkedin would be the only thing that was bigger. I think
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:07.160]   Amy I think it is a future in chat. Is that is that so?
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.600]   A couple of a couple things first of all
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.280]   According to microsoft two years ago. The future was ai so the future changes. Yes, of course it does constantly
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.760]   um, but if you if you
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.240]   You know, if you look at
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.400]   What if you look at this possible acquisition as part of a broader constellation
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.560]   Here's where I think it gets interesting. So microsoft is already
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.040]   Uh, the invisible infrastructure powering
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.080]   Azure for everyday lives their network service. Yeah
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:41.000]   Azure it's it's the back end of crestron. Yeah, I mean, it's we don't think about it
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.080]   But it's not as big as a ws, but it's but it's probably number two. Well, but it's not just it's not just cloud
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.880]   Um, it's core infrastructure and so many it's it's
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.000]   It's a lot, right if facebook goes away tomorrow
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.520]   You have a lot of small business collapse. You've got you know part of a social ecosystem collapse
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.000]   But the world doesn't stop functioning if microsoft
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.040]   Had some kind of catastrophic issue and and poofed off the face of the planet
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.880]   You know, we we don't much of business operations
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   Critical infrastructure no longer works without microsoft. So what I think is very interesting is that
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.360]   Uh, you know, it's got get it's um, it discord
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.040]   Is i'm on discord for other reasons, but um, so you've got you've got discord microsoft
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.880]   You used to use let me ask you actually
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:33.560]   Parenthetically used to use key base for a secure chat with other parents and friends
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.800]   You use discord now for that
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:43.880]   I'm I started on discord because of defcon. So, um, that's that's where you that's where you could follow the defcon
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.840]   Yeah, I just uh, it's not my favorite platform, but i'm i'm on it
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.600]   Um key base got sold to zoom. Are you still using key base?
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.000]   Uh, yeah
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.560]   They didn't change they're still around. Yeah, I don't know if they're spending any energy on it
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:06.440]   But in terms of content creation, I don't I don't think that's the story. I think that's the story related to this particular
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.080]   um set of purchases
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.240]   Azure has a farm. So so they're building out cloud for
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.960]   Um, precision agriculture out in the field. Yeah, that's right. So
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.760]   In order to automate farming, which it gets no pickup or coverage
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.160]   They've also built it was microsoft that's trying to figure out how to use dna to store
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.000]   um
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Unimaginable amounts of data
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   So I think if you look at this constellation of things which at first seem very unrelated
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.520]   The the story
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.040]   Possibly into the future is that microsoft is trying to figure out how to be the sort of next next
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:48.360]   Infrastructure layer. Yeah. Yeah, which is a smart move. Yeah, that's what x cloud is about their streaming gaming service
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.200]   Is is a lot of growth is about that as much as it is about gaming
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.760]   Um, so I don't think this is like
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:00.120]   And I don't I don't think microsoft. I think to tick tock is a something totally separate
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:08.040]   Um, but I always assumed they would want something like tick tock for the data for the just like linked in and and you know
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.000]   I think that's part of it, but microsoft also has effectively its own corporate
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.200]   Foreign service department its own sort of department of state within the company in fact
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   It poached a lot of people from from the state department. So I think I think microsoft is is playing a slightly bigger
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:30.440]   Um different game and tick tock would have been a pretty nice bargaining chip to have to have had
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.640]   Kevin the chat room and I think a lot of our audience
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:39.160]   Uh says they prefer matrix and element, which is an open source chat platform
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.040]   Instead what what is discord's closed source advantage over matrix for instance?
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:51.080]   I haven't used a lot of the others. I basically go where the projects are like where the founders are creating these new communities and then
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.760]   Discord is just pretty much the standard at least in the cryptocurrency space, which is where I spend probably you know
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.800]   80% of my time evaluating new deals and so um, it's
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:08.280]   I can't compare it to the others, but I will say some of the mechanics around what they've done with it in terms of
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:17.000]   The moderation and the bot integrations. Uh, I'll give you one really wild example. There was a discord that to join
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.560]   Someone created an erc 20 token on ethereum
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.840]   And you had to own one of these tokens
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.320]   And so if you owned one of these tokens and it was in your wallet
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.280]   You could join but the bot would then go and look at your wallet on the blockchain
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.160]   Confirm that you own the token to let you into the actual that's clever chat group
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.880]   That's better than the asshole your token yet
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.840]   But you could sell your token to someone else and they go up and then they have access groups becoming more valuable
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:53.720]   Yeah, it's it's crazy. So some of the stuff I just see being done there is is super creative somebody in the chat room posted
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.280]   uh an article
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.080]   About azure saying that one of the reasons tech pundits have a hard time understanding
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.760]   All of the fingers and all the pies that microsoft has is because it isn't the same as a ws
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.960]   Is that amis that what you're saying? It's more than just cloud
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.520]   Yeah, um
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:18.840]   Again, I microsoft. I know is not the world sexiest company. Uh, however, it's getting sex here. It's getting sexier
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.600]   It is
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.160]   It is got dna. Um, yeah all over it. Yeah. So I think I think part of it is
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:31.400]   I don't know. I don't know that's an apt comparison because a ws is its own unruly enormous thing too and and
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   Amazon in many ways is just as um
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.640]   Decentralized in terms of all the work it's doing but azure
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.560]   It
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:45.240]   There is something called farm beats. So this is something they are specifically building for connected farming
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.080]   Equipment
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:54.200]   Um to enable a future of precision agriculture which effectively means you don't have a bunch of farmhands and all the traditional people that you would need
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.760]   you've got engineered crops that
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.960]   Produce 10x the yield and require a fraction of the of the resources
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.800]   Um, you know, it's kind of that maybe that you're two farmers or or sitting in Bangladesh
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:15.000]   It's kind of basically an investment in what they see is uh, uh, what is going to be a next the next big thing
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Is far right and if you think about the next big things in terms of not opportunity, but risk
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   I think that's where some of this becomes more clear
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:28.680]   We know that we've got uh extreme climate change and uh extreme weather events
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:34.360]   We know that we have uh food insecurity. We've the global supply of food is is
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:41.000]   You know, um at risk right now. So if you're thinking about your markets, you know 10 15 years into the future
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.800]   But some of this starts to make more sense
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.360]   It's also crazy how I feel like as as an engineer. I see
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:55.960]   Entrepreneurs that say well, I choose the solution based on one on building right like if you're going for some of the
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:01.720]   Uh, the ml models that google offers, you know with with their custom silicon or or you want to even go with
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:07.800]   AWS they're doing other own custom chips that are super efficient low power cheaper than you know, uh,
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.480]   Ex-learning six chips. Yeah, um, yeah, so it's it's it's you know
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:16.200]   You kind of have to look and say what am I building and and who has the best solution for that? Right, right?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:23.960]   Uh, it also might explain different we talked about this a month ago why bill gates is the number one farmland owner in america
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.840]   Did you know that? Amy? He owns I did I didn't know that two thousand acres
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.640]   Of farmland. It's a good investment
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.760]   It yes and no
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:41.560]   Um, I think a lot of the future farming will be indoors and underground so they're yeah huge indoor plant factory is again
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.000]   once salt mines full of vertical uh farming
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.760]   Yeah, just you know, we're pretty close to being able to engineer
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.280]   um
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.280]   We we can already use synthetic biology to engineer crops and in new ways
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:59.800]   And we we have many more people on the planet. We have the the conditions
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.040]   Used to determine how to grow things or less and less
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.720]   Stable meaning we've worse weather, you know a fifth of all garments
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:14.440]   That are made of cotton are I think i've got this wrong fifth of all the
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.760]   Yeah, one out of five garments basically relies on on cotton from china
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.640]   Which is my way of saying you've got geopolitical instability huge global supply chains. Yeah
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:29.560]   Yeah, so all of this starts to make a little bit more sense if if what you're aiming for is easier
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.840]   geopolitics and better sustainability and better certainty in conditions
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:40.600]   Then yeah, you want to instead of like sourcing your cotton from western china and then maybe it gets stuck on a
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.400]   Barge and the you know panama canal
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.520]   um, you know instead you you
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.760]   uh
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.480]   You know instead you you grow these things
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.920]   underground or in warehouses and um
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.560]   You reduce a lot of that uncertainty by the way, let's just quickly check because
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:05.720]   We're keeping an eye on that's that ship in the sues canal. Is the ship still stuck dot com
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.680]   Yes
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   Cost us so far 53 billion dollars in shipping that's
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.440]   Stalled
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.080]   Behind the there's uh autonomous. So that's a that's a that's a problem that ate
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:26.120]   So there's a bunch of companies ibm is one of them that is working on um full autopilot shipping capabilities
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.920]   I don't know if it would have helped in that situation, but
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.080]   Here's a here's as long as for two in the ever-given story
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:39.880]   Here's a website john found for me ever-given dash everywhere dot glitch dot me
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.400]   You can take the ever-given and put it anywhere
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.120]   You want blocking any
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:53.160]   Harbor you want you can rotate it make the boat bigger make it smaller and you can just fit it right in there's a new
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.040]   There's the new york harbor will just block up
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:02.200]   Manhattan right there with the ever-given and actually if I make it to scale it's a lot smaller
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.560]   We have to find a special right there. Just put it right there
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.360]   And i'll have a block that Lincoln tunnel that will make it
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.360]   That's cutter
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:15.800]   Uh, that is a that is a wild story i have to say
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:24.440]   Okay, let's move along. We just talked about microsoft buying uh discord
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.080]   Let's and we mentioned amazon i guess we could
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.360]   So this is one of the one of the problems i'm starting to face
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.080]   In uh in the stuff we've covered this has changed a lot that kevin's is used to
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:41.480]   Beyond twit used to be about computers smart phones
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:46.040]   You know technology the technology story has really broadened
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:51.960]   Uh for instance now we know the documents show amazon is aware that drivers p in bottles
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.600]   And even defecate en route
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.880]   Is that a tech story?
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.280]   I don't think so
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:06.680]   That may not be but the robots the pacing robots that they filed a patent on which i've got on my desktop i'll try to find it
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:15.800]   Um, the they've been working on haptic wristbands and pacing robots for warehouses to to help the human workers move faster
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.280]   Pacing that's a nice way to put it
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.400]   Is it is it have a cattle prod attached to it? How does it keep the
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.120]   Um, no because it it's slowly
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.360]   Or i guess quickly speeds itself up if people aren't moving
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.640]   Oh my god. You mean is it like a conveyor or is it the the pickin the pickers robots
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.440]   It's it's for the pickers, but what's the bigger story here? What's the more interesting piece the more interesting piece is that
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:45.000]   I think the assumption is that it's robots that ultimately obviate humans. No these environments. They're going to drive humans
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.880]   Well, like it's like mules
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   Right. It's the robots
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.840]   It's the computer systems, which is why this is a computer story the computer systems that are making the cognitive
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.080]   Decisions and at the moment human labor is cheaper. Yes, you know
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.520]   And and it's the humans acting like robots and it's infinitely
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.000]   replaceable humans are fungible and
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.400]   So you wear one out you just go out and get another one apparently
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.840]   That's actually there's a tie-in story to that because amazon is also requiring its drivers to sign
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:20.520]   Agreements to allow themselves to be monitored by cameras to make sure they're paying attention
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.320]   Which I think is probably a reasonable safety precaution, but that's that same note that same idea
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:30.600]   That same mindset of oh you're just plugging the humans, but we'll have the machines keep track of everything
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.240]   They're doing to make sure they're they're doing a good job
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:43.000]   Is is it just a stopgap eventually the robots will become good enough. We don't need the humans anymore. That was uber's model, right?
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.760]   Get rid of these drivers again. What would it take for?
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:53.240]   What would it take for a machine to totally obviate a human and
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   uh
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.480]   Not only does it require?
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.800]   Technical competence, but you have to have analog fallbacks and fail-safes
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:07.000]   And then you've got a regulatory hurdles and you got actuarial problems because everything has to get insured
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   so
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.320]   You know sounds like maybe we should stick with the humans
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.760]   Just let the robots prod them a lot of people
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.800]   Yeah, but cheaper, but at some point yes and at some point
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.200]   If we have a machine doing something more efficiently better more repetitively
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.640]   Right um over and over and over again
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.800]   That you know that makes our lives better than then we use a calculator
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.480]   Right
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.640]   We no longer do long division by hand right?
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.440]   Right
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.760]   It's an interesting world we live in
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.840]   If if any if nothing else so those are the tech stories because that really is how tech
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.520]   Is is changing the world we live in I think those are much more
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.120]   Interesting at least they're more in our
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:56.120]   In our wheelhouse so to speak
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:01.640]   Uh there in other words, there's a lot of amazon union stories
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:08.280]   Teslas in trouble for the same kind of labor anti-labor practices. It's not a tech story
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.920]   I'm gonna leave those out those that's a that's a union story
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:15.000]   But the larger story is that these companies don't don't really
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.960]   They don't think of
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.840]   Workers as people they're more cogs in a machine
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.280]   And they just happen to be very nicely tuned they have fingers and
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:29.720]   You know, there is a tech story so that because um over the I guess it was friday
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:35.640]   Three unions at khande nast um voted 98 to go on strike. So that was ours
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.400]   Pitchfork and the new yorker. I think ours is going on strike
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:45.160]   Wow new yorkers going on strike. Wow on friday. So the tech story
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.280]   Is related to the game stop
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:55.000]   Um, uh trading that happened and that is you know, we organize in new ways now. We've got totally different ways of um
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.120]   Of sharing ideas and information. We've got people who have been playing
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.640]   Multiplayer games now for a decade. Um, and know how to organize for tactical attacks
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   So I would say all of these things are related to how how we organize online which is fundamentally different than how we were doing that 10 years
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:20.840]   Well and social media has really given us a very effective tool for online organizing. I mean if it weren't for uh reddit, I don't think
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.320]   You know
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.560]   Game stop would have taken off it was it was
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:31.000]   Because reddit existed that these people could gather together and plan their assault
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.960]   Twitter and facebook as well
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:41.720]   Um, I would say also the tools on the robin hood side, right because before the other side too. Yes, remember to do options trading used to require
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:46.760]   Like a five page like, you know questionnaire. You'd have to figure fill out at your broke rage
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:53.320]   And now it's like you could have an instant robin hood account and do very complex trades that the average consumer should not be touching
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:58.120]   With a couple little clicks, you know, it's very easy to do options much easier than it used to be. Yeah
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:04.040]   I think the broker just trying to protect you right to make sure that you understood right the risk you were
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.200]   Involved and you think robin hoods culpable for making it easy
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.480]   Uh, you know, there are a number of people who think robin hood made it too easy
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:18.760]   It's tough. It's tough because in some sense you want people to have access to some of these tools
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.800]   Why should only rich people be able to use this?
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:29.720]   But then should robin hood be the one so so the interesting thing for my vantage point
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:37.000]   Was that when trading became so volatile and the volume was so high it wasn't the scc that stepped in
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:44.760]   Um robin hood made a decision and it's it happened at around the same time that that aws kick parlor off
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.800]   robin hood was forced to make the decision though because they didn't they would have to have enough cash on hand
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.280]   Right to back those trades
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.360]   They still made a decision and
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.160]   The difference here is that if you look at some of these things together
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:01.880]   The normally these are in our institutions that would have made those decisions instead. They're not so
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:07.320]   In fact, just as we got dedos that when the jobs act passed that was one of the things that made it
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.960]   A much lower bar for investors, right?
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:15.880]   They allowed other people without a million dollars in the bank to uh to invest
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:23.640]   Changed it changed everything. Is it illegal for robin hood to make it this easy for option investing or is it just something
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.720]   The big
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.360]   Illegal they wouldn't have been a lot. Yeah, it's legal right so I think the the the to me
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:34.360]   What does it mean when a company shuts off access? So
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:40.520]   One of the things we've noticed is a what I would call a c-dos a corporate denial of service
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:46.440]   I like it. I like it. Um, but we're we're going to be seeing more of those. I think because
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:53.320]   Um, sometimes you build a product the product is successful. It solves it's a solution, right? But you don't think about the knock-on
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.840]   effects you don't think about dual use new ways in which these things could go wrong and
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.800]   Quite frankly, nobody I mean I work with these companies all the time. They they don't want to have that conversation
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.560]   Um and increasingly a lot of lawyers
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:13.720]   And risk officers also don't want to have that conversation because they don't want to on record that they thought
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:18.120]   About these things that might go wrong and then somebody could sue them after the fact
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.760]   But we can't stick our heads in the in the sand and and
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:27.800]   Assume that everything will go well forever. I mean, you know, there's always some kind of problem on the horizon that has to be dealt with
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.720]   Kevin easy. Do you feel like Robinhood is a good thing
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.720]   for
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:38.920]   Normal people or a or does it make it too easy? Well, I mean, I think that there's certainly
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:46.040]   Well, it was a couple of different things one the fractional ownership of of very expensive companies
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.440]   I think is an important thing for the average consumer to be able to do
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:53.880]   Um, you know, it's important that if I don't have enough money to to buy a single share of you know
[00:59:54.680 --> 01:00:00.600]   Berkshire or something that I can still go and do that in a five or ten dollar way. Um, the options
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.200]   uh
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.400]   I I
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:08.520]   Is I feel like there needs to be at least another hurdle of understanding, you know that before
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.960]   People can get involved there, but but that said it wasn't the the options trading that that was the problem
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   It was the coordinated attack, but even then
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.760]   I don't know that
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.240]   Uh, I don't know if you can consider that a problem like what?
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.080]   What went wrong was there something that really went wrong there?
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.320]   The the the system
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   Functioned as planned
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.400]   Robinhood got a little bit of heat
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.920]   And they apparently had to put off their ipo, but I think that that's passed now, right that that
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.640]   I don't know if people blame robin hood still
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:47.160]   Right, but if you had just left that going and just let let that war continue
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.920]   Um
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.760]   What what would break? I mean I get that some people lose money
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.800]   Left holding yeah, sure, but would that be the hedge funds?
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.760]   I mean, well, it's hard to tell isn't it?
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.760]   Well, that's part of it. It's a very opaque
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:06.040]   What about game stock? What about the company? Yeah, I mean, how does this affect them at all?
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.880]   Well, if you've got people's bonuses tied to
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.720]   people's
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.720]   You know salary tied tied to stock price. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All it allows them to do is raise capital
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:24.360]   Very easily right they can just go out and issue new shares and and have a a lot more capital in the books
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.920]   But nobody's gonna invest in this company. There's no reason for game stop to exist
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.480]   It's at 181 bucks still. I don't understand it myself
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.760]   Somebody's it is but if you look at what sony
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.960]   I mean look at what all the other companies are doing they're all moving to subscriptions
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.160]   These models microsoft. Right. So you know, think about this in the longer term
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:52.920]   Is I think the issue? Well, it's kind of to me. This is again the word speculation comes to mind that people aren't really worried about
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.960]   GameStop as a company
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:02.520]   Uh, they're concerned about the stock and whether the stock's gonna go up and whether they're gonna buy it at a price that allows them to make money
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.600]   When they sell it
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.040]   That's it's gonna be interesting if the new
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.560]   If the new land grabs over the next couple of years
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.440]   If these new wars are fought over
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:20.680]   Companies like GameStop versus countries like whoever got invaded recently, you know, if that's if that's if that's
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.000]   It's interesting. You think already seeing that look at china and it's soft power. We've talked about this before Amy
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.600]   Uh, china's never gonna invade the united states, but they don't necessarily need to or want to know
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.480]   Now they can exert their power economically. Really it's it's economic power
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.160]   They already are yeah. Yeah, the game stop
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:47.480]   Investment thesis is I agree with you. I mean if you take a look at earnings and where everything's going to do with fun about
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.920]   Yeah, right nothing to the fundamentals, but at the same time
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.840]   You have a collection of people that said GameStop was part of my childhood. I don't want this to go away
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:02.920]   Interesting. So I'm going to put money into it and I don't see anything wrong with that. That's part of its value company of flow
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.760]   Yeah, part of the value is the brand value. Right. That's that's a that's another fundamental
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.760]   All right, it's I just again. This is another I'm not buying it
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.200]   No game
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   Crypto punks, but not GameStop
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.360]   Crypto punks was the very first
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.880]   Digital art they'll never be another one chain. They'll never be another first
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.560]   That's actually drives a lot of nft's doesn't it the first
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.520]   Yes, especially on the on the crypto punks side. I mean they're the ones that define the standard
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.800]   So, you know that that's why I hold a couple of them. I mean, it's not any crazy amount on my overall net worth
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.160]   But I have a a few of them is a diversification strategy for you though
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.040]   I mean is it part of your well if you want to do that then it gets even crazier leo down the rabbit hole here you go
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.880]   You can basically take and buy in there's a site called nftx
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.480]   which with people transfer their crypto punks into
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.760]   Like a smart contract that then wraps them all together and you hold a token
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.880]   That holds a diversified pool of underlying crypto punks
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.960]   So you can
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.440]   So as they appreciate so you have crypto punks derivatives is that's what you're saying?
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.080]   basically, yeah
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.920]   What could possibly be like you have a fractional ownership of like somebody's pile of beanie babies
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:29.720]   Well, I mean that's what he missed that he I mean, I'm sure you've seen this and so this is the crazy story
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.600]   You know, Michael Jordan rookie card the physical rookie card not some crazy digital thing. Yeah
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.880]   Um, you know, it was uh 15 20 000 a year ago and now they're going for a million dollars
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:47.080]   And part of part of why that jump happened people are saying is because a lot of these fractional ownership sites went online
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.520]   That said we have a vault we will store your Michael Jordan rookie card
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.880]   And you can own a small very a ten dollar chunk of it a 50 dollar chunk of it and all of a sudden
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.200]   All these people that could it increases the probable pool of money. That's right
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.520]   Well, that's exactly what happened with that 69 dollar 69 million dollar people
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:11.000]   Was he sold off shares in that what is it B plus he was able to sell off fractional ownership of that
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.160]   So interesting, uh, yeah interesting. I think he made money
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.840]   Isn't that what it's all about people's people's doing all right
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:27.240]   That's an amazing people is that's an amazing story. That's just a wild story in some ways. I I like it because
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.240]   It is at least rewarding creativity, right? I mean this guy
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.520]   Is very create he's an artist so in some ways at least the artist is in front
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:44.840]   Uh, so that's good. You know, I still think a lot of the stuff that's going on is speculative not not a part of
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.800]   Yeah, I mean essentially what's happening with ineptes and this is this is the
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.040]   The downside of the scariest side of the bubble side, which I absolutely believe exists
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.440]   It's it's that anyone with Photoshop or whatever the name of the app is that can export your ping
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:04.040]   Can become a creator of nft's. Yeah, and so you're gonna have some cream that rises to the service that is
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.480]   Fantastic artists that deserve the recognition and the make good money
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:14.760]   And they're gonna have a bunch of garbage and just like fad stuff and clones and copycats and it's it's iCOs three years ago
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.200]   You know, there was a lot of garbage
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:21.480]   But out of all of that a few very credible projects emerge and we'll be here for the long term
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.480]   You know who's gonna make money
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.760]   In nft's is the is the company that charges you 60 or 70 bucks to mint the nft
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.000]   They're gonna be the ones
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.040]   It's like
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:36.760]   The people made the money in the gold rush relieve eyes because they sold the blue jeans and the picks
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:42.520]   To those yeah, that's called the miners right now on a theorem right because they're getting all the crazy gas fees that people are spending
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.200]   Yeah, have these things minted. Yeah, that's that's where the money is
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:53.800]   Um, at least for sure money anyway, some then there will be people make a lot of money on it. I'm sure there'll also be people
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   You know, it's kind of a
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   Interesting company in the middle of all this is Kodak
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.440]   Kodak remember remember the Kodak I see so I have always used Kodak
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440]   as the
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:09.880]   The prime example of how a brick and mortar company could not make it in a digital world
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.640]   They made and so much money on film developing and and uh sales
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.760]   That even when when the world went digital
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.680]   Even though they were one of the first companies who embraced digital photography
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:29.320]   They couldn't survive because there wasn't enough profit in the digital side of it to match what they had made in the brick and mortar side
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:36.200]   So I use Kodak as the example of everything that that went wrong with digital. You're saying they're doing well now
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:41.000]   No, no, I'm saying they tried to launch an Ico. Oh god
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   I was a while ago, right?
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.520]   Right and I think I mean it's not a really oh they had Kodak coin
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:54.600]   Right, which I think had something to do with photographers. Yeah, yeah photographers in royalty
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.120]   Which then kind of sort of made sense, but again like the art photography
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.720]   Yeah, and then they got into I guess vaccines. So, you know, that's the funniest thing about that
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:09.400]   They they understood the digital world. They were right there. They're look they were they did an ICO
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.040]   And it didn't help. Yeah. Yeah, but look at that. I mean some brands have done this quite well
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.600]   Like look at moleskin moleskin came out one of the best note-taking apps on ipad and ios
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.000]   That's true. They're making tons of money. They got app of the year
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.080]   They can't they can't sell the notebooks, but they can sell a digital version of it. Yeah
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.800]   Yeah
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:33.080]   That's where that's brand equity is what that is right. There's no reason to use a moleskin app over
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.680]   you know
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.680]   Any other note-taking app, but
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.320]   It's but it's moleskin
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   Or as I say moleskin
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:51.720]   I once I was Spanish. I once asked them how you pronounce it. They say any way you want. They don't care. They don't care
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:58.920]   I do want to talk about the weaponization of of social media because that I think is kind of an underlying
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.840]   thread here
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.680]   And just a little bit great panel. It's just the two of them, but we don't need more. Amy web kevin rose
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.240]   lovely having you
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.600]   Oh wait a minute. We're getting this traffic report in
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.720]   from the sues canal. Should we
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.040]   Should we check in with john hanson john is of course
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:26.360]   Who has canal traffic report ever given ever stuck in just south of the fresh food market on 23 jewel
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.840]   Nothing doing north or south as head to the north you can see gapers delays real heavy here
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.560]   Especially as you get closer to great bitter lake where everyone's just stuck and bitter themselves heading up to the north
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.440]   Nothing doing here too breaks all the way up to the port's
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.280]   Saying to the south too sues golf looking pretty heavy nowhere going anywhere
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.720]   And this extends all the way out to the red sea red sea more like red brick lights for the as far as the I can see now
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.960]   Your alternates will be zooming out here and look to the south around the ethio being coast jibouty
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.040]   Nothing doing there. We're gonna have to go all the way around down south now your alternate mad
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.560]   You can go left right full planes are open all the way around k-porn. Now. This will take you 10 days
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.440]   It'll certainly save you the five or six. She'll be stuck there
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.920]   New West canal traffic. All right. There you go. The latest from the sues canal
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.720]   1.5 crazy
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.640]   Crazy number if you took all the containers off that ship and stacked them lengthwise
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.320]   You it would they would they would stretch from chicago to alpasso
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.760]   That's a little on that ship. That is a that is a huge
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:29.560]   Huge ship when you realize that each one of those little boxes you see on the ship is a railroad box car
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.360]   You really get nothing about what's in those boxes, right? Yeah, do we know what the cargo is?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.480]   I've heard something about toilet paper like there's some of the
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:43.000]   They were right there will be a toilet paper shortage. We just got the year wrong
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.080]   Our show today brought to you by udacity
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.640]   Udacity is brilliant
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.480]   Started by Sebastian thron. He was at google and he realized when he was at google he said, you know
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.240]   There's a problem here people are getting trained for tech jobs, but they're not getting the skills we need
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.720]   To get the people we need to hire and and google wasn't alone a lot of the big tech companies realized
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.000]   We've got to create a way for people to get the skills we need
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.800]   Filled and they created these nanodegrees at udacity
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.120]   It's an all a unique online educational offering designed to bridge the gap
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:24.040]   Between the the learning you've been getting and your career goals. You'll learn a suite of employable skills
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.760]   We know they're employable skills because udacity partners with industry leaders
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.960]   And experts who understand the in-demand skills applicable to the job market they work with google
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.560]   IBM
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.480]   Microsoft Amazon and many other companies to create these nanodegrees
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.440]   Once and I love how they do it. It is not
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:49.640]   Rote learning. It is exactly the way learning should be if I joined udacity in 2012. I think I took a python course there
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.280]   Early on because I was so impressed with this the nanodegrees came out
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.880]   Once you enroll in a student as a student in a specific course, you're going to be prompted to watch the videos
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:08.040]   Great teachers great videos. This is actually kind of a fundamental education philosophy that I love get the best people in the field
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.440]   To create these videos once and once only but now you've got them
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.320]   And then surround them
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:22.120]   With hands-on experience so many times you take online courses. You never really have to test your metal
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.880]   But at udacity you'll have to complete a series of projects
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:32.760]   They'll be they'll be reviewed by professionals. You'll be able to get real human help personalized code reviews
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.560]   And and even mentors 24/7
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.320]   So you're not alone, but that project based active learning means when it comes time to get the job
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.120]   You'll you'll know how to do it. You'll have done it
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.560]   You'll be able to do it
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.280]   Some of the most sought after nanodegrees with udacity for consumers and business clients are
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.440]   In the top 10 data analysts. Yeah, you're not surprising program for data science with python
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.360]   That's what i'm looking at for my next course digital marketing their soft skills as well tech adjacent roles
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.760]   programming development
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.280]   product management
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.960]   AI cloud computing data science autonomous systems people from all over the world use udacity
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.600]   And and because it's people from all over the world
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.560]   And because so many people are doing this while they have a day job
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   Udacity is completely flexible
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:26.680]   You can learn at your own pace in your own schedule so it can it can kind of work with what you're doing right now
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:33.400]   But you'll get real employable skills through project based active learning covering the leading edge technology
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:41.960]   Udacity also has free courses in fact they have some great courses for polishing up your portfolio on github or your resume on linkedin

[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:10.600]   Chrissy Teigen the unofficial mayor of twitter is leaving
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.080]   town
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.560]   She and john legend. I didn't realize this
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.520]   were
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.640]   tagged
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.440]   name name what do they call it name dropped name checked by qanon
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.200]   apparently
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:32.840]   The qanon conspiracy thinks that she and john legend are running a pedophile ring out of a pizza re in washington dc
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.160]   Yes, it's pizza gate
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.240]   She has been abused. She says on twitter for years
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.680]   13.7 million followers twitter said she's the unofficial mayor of twitter. She says i'm leaving
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:51.640]   It no longer serves me positively as it serves me negatively
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.120]   And I think that's the right time to call something
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.320]   She says uh, she's been beat up
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.040]   For years i've taken so many small
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:06.600]   Two follower account punches that is by accounts that have only two followers they're brand new created just for abuse
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.000]   at this point i'm honestly uh deeply
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.880]   bruise blocked when more than a million twitter accounts last july
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.600]   deleted thousands of
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.600]   tweets
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.840]   I know that kevin. I think you invested in twitter very early on right
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:28.280]   I did. Yes. Yeah big are you still a twitter guy to support twitter
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.800]   uh, I mean i
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:38.040]   I know that um, I love jack as a ceo and I know that the challenges that the scale they're at are
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.760]   insanely complex um, they're being attacked on so many different fronts
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:49.480]   Yeah, he was in washington dc this week. We'll talk about that testifying. It's so it's uh, I wouldn't want to be running that
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.720]   that piece of software. I think that's uh
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.240]   A product I wouldn't want to be in charge of but I'm still a fan. I use it
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:00.040]   I like the people that I follow and I get a lot of value out of it as a user
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.480]   But you know, I just like yuleo i'm sure or anybody else uses it
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:08.360]   I'm not sure how much use it these days, but I get a lot of random people that will say things
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:14.120]   And I just end up blocking them as well. It's just uh the nature of the beast twitter put together a survey
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.880]   uh
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.160]   for it's it
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.000]   ostensibly to collect
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.200]   Uh people's opinions and how they should handle these difficult political
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.680]   challenges
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:30.200]   But I really think the real reason they created we we did we did it on wednesday on uh, this week in google
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:36.760]   The real reason they created the survey was to show you how impossible their job is
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.040]   Uh, you know when you when you take the survey
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:46.360]   Well, let me see if I can find it. They ask you, you know, all right. He's a he's a world leader not in your country
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:53.480]   He's using his official twitter account and he's saying something bad about a group in another country
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:18:01.640]   Should he be banned? Should he be warned? Should we put a uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, correction on the tweet
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:06.120]   You know and the and you sit there and you read all these things and it's like, oh, yeah, yay
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.360]   I don't know. I don't know what to do
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.520]   Um, I'll find here. I'll find the survey. Oh, it's down. It's gone
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.840]   Oh, well
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.440]   Um, I wanted to show you the survey, but I think it was very effective and demonstrated. Oh there it there it was by the way
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.240]   I'm just closed it. I'll open it up again for you john
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.760]   um
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.640]   Calling for public input on our approach to world leaders
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:33.000]   And yet I think the real reason they put this up is once you take it you realize it's impossible
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.800]   who knows, you know
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   Go ahead. Amy
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.400]   Oh, I was I was going to ask you why what you found compelling about that survey
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:48.840]   Uh just how intractable that the problem is
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:55.480]   Um, I wish it was still up. I guess they took it. It says starting march 19th. Yeah, I guess they only did it for a week
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.840]   Uh, yeah, I closed monday april 12
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.200]   Uh, did you had you seen it? Had you taken it?
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.320]   Um, I don't think that they care about the answer. That's what my point was they don't
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.440]   Right that they they just wanted you to understand how
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.360]   And I also
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:18.280]   Right. I don't think they care about my answer to that survey. I also think they don't care about capital T capital Ava answer, right?
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.720]   Um, these the truth is that um
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:27.560]   These platforms have undermined public health and safety
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.240]   um in our country and in other countries
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.440]   And there are address there are ways to address those problems, but
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.960]   Nobody has addressed them not in a meaningful substantive way for a very long time
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:50.200]   And so the challenge now is that you've I had a conversation with some of the execs. I don't know deck 10 years ago
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:58.520]   Um, I didn't see how twitter was going to make was going to earn the kind of revenue it was going to need to survive over the long term
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.640]   And it seemed to me like um
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.600]   There were alternative paths forward, but
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.200]   Too often I hear from folks
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:13.080]   You know, we're just focused on the product. We just want to work on the product and and that's what we're doing
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:17.400]   You know, the problem is you can't just focus on the product. You also have to think about the next order impacts
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.720]   Because at some point, you know, you could face a problem
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.360]   Um, I have to say ever since twitter
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:30.040]   Finally did the right thing with trump's account. It's been nice and quiet around here
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.840]   Uh, and it makes you wonder why
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.880]   They didn't do it for four years
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.240]   Uh, it was there were speech implications. There were there were all I mean
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.560]   It should not have gotten to that point, right because because
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:50.600]   In waiting that long now you yes, you're a platform, but you're also a platform with world leaders who are clearly
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:57.160]   It wasn't it would not have been easy to just shut off that pipeline at the beginning
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:02.360]   Because because of escalated it gotten you know, yeah, I understand initially they were
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:07.480]   He's the president of the United States. You know, we're gonna give him a bully pulpit. He got elected
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.280]   He he deserves the right to free speech
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.520]   Although he said things that other people would have immediately been banned for
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:20.120]   Right, but you can't for 10 years say we're just a platform. We're not making editorial comments
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.360]   We're not making comments on speech and then deplatform the president of the United States
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.640]   Even though he is you know was saying should they've done nothing? I'm true
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.000]   No, I mean I here's what I'm saying
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.440]   I'm saying you don't want to be a company where you get to the position that decision period
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.800]   Yeah, you don't want to have to make these decisions under duress. It's not good for your employees
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.880]   It's not good for the executives
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.800]   Um, you you wind up having to make decisions for wrong reasons. My point is
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.240]   Well before you get to that point you need to be thinking
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:57.080]   Smarter about your financials and about your long-term survivability and what makes you vulnerable
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.040]   And what makes you know what what parts of business or brittle?
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:07.080]   They should have been thinking ahead about what they were getting in themselves. I think that's a it's pretty it's pretty easy to say
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.040]   Uh, it was starting to be new today and hindsight
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.400]   But if you look back on when when twitter was from skiing out the ground
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.440]   Um, you know, we were all I remember some of a very first week just being like hey
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.080]   Where are we all going to meet up at south by saying last it was like it was like let's just get together and hanging out
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.600]   That's totally fine, but like three years post south by in 20. Oh
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.040]   I don't know several years. Then
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:34.520]   I was just because then you had the fail will right because they couldn't scale it because right
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:38.760]   Growing so fast and so it wasn't like they were always behind
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:42.360]   On in terms of the tech stack and always playing catch up, right?
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.520]   And then all of a sudden politicians came online hate speech came online
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.120]   I'm not I just think it's a very very tough
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:55.880]   Challenge when you have literally millions of users joining per day. There are going to be a ton of bad actors in there
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.480]   Like how do you fix that? Look? I'm curious. Amy. What would you do to fix it?
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.160]   So
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:07.720]   I'm I don't want to say the year because I don't remember what year it was if it was 2012 sometime between 2012 and 2014
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.840]   Um, I I had this conversation with of and the challenge is that
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.560]   um
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.440]   You have to figure out a way. I mean you have to you have to do
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:25.560]   You have every company has to build risk modeling into their product process. It has to be part of the road map
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:32.920]   Um because otherwise you get to a place where you can you can no longer make the decisions that would have been easy
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.240]   You're a while ago. So
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:42.680]   By 2015 it was pretty obvious that there were bad actors using the platform as you know, um and and bots
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.880]   Maybe it was before then because I was at state talking about this
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:51.080]   But you want to be in a position where you've got some alternatives and contingencies
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.480]   I just don't think they did
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:57.800]   Yeah, but when you have I mean so back then they had rails was falling over
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.760]   They were trying to get Cassandra off the ground as a database structure
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.760]   Cassandra as it was in its alpha
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.240]   Like they couldn't even like how can you build anything to go after users when you can't even stand up?
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.240]   There were more immediate
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.040]   I hear you what 10 years from now a president of the United States might do on the platform
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.920]   There were they couldn't keep their tech stack working right
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:23.240]   I totally seen the last three years. They should have done a lot more because they did figure out all those problems
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.040]   Yeah, it's a well long gone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, run gone
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.920]   But I think I totally is that generally Kevin you'd work with a lot of startups. I don't think startups
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.480]   Are thinking that way they're hoping they can survive
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.440]   They're just hoping they can get the minimum viable product working. They're not thinking. What are the risks down the road?
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:47.160]   Yeah, unfortunately to Amy's point. Sorry, Amy. I'll let you go. Sorry. You go ahead. Sorry
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.720]   I keep I keep interjecting you go and then I'll I'll say what I was going to say
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.880]   I was just I was just going to say that
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.560]   To your point they need to be thinking about this from from day one and honestly most entrepreneurs are thinking
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:01.960]   How can I even get viral to begin with? You know, how can I get those first million users?
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.800]   They're they're not thinking about about risk or what happens if this is, you know, 50 million people 100 million people are using this product
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:13.400]   Right, so this is like I you know, this is not me with a crystal ball
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.320]   Using hindsight to say what they should have like it's easy for me to now say what they should have done
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:24.520]   I have been tracking this as one of the early early early users and I've been tracking this for whatever 13 years 14 years
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.240]   the point is that
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.200]   Even in the day even in the fail will days
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.760]   um
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.040]   Even when you're just trying to get the products to scale even when you've got people
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.560]   uh
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.320]   Coming out of the platform because it's exciting and there's all kinds of interesting things happening
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:50.280]   You somebody in the organization still needs to be in charge of doing the longer range forecasting and you said this to be fair
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.680]   I've known you
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:56.440]   To say this for years the companies don't think strategically
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.120]   And that's one of the things you really have long pushed for is they have to start look medium
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.240]   And yeah, I mean if we want to stick within the mediums having the same problem. Yeah, mediums
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:12.680]   Right. Why are they having that same problem? Uh because the financials don't work. Why do the financials don't work?
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:18.920]   You know, you so medium just we should just say for people who don't know medium just pivoted have williams who founded twitter
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.520]   When went off founded medium which originally looked like just a black a blogging platform
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.280]   But uh, they decided that they they wanted to have an in-house
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.720]   journalistic publications so that they could charge a five dollar a month subscription fee
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:39.960]   Uh, and this week, uh, have essentially laid everybody off. He didn't lay them off
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.000]   He gave him buyouts and encouraged them to take off
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.440]   But I think effectively medium has shuttered its
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.920]   journalistic
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.720]   Arm and they're just going to now be a blog platform again
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.480]   And that's a pivot ebbs known for his pivots. He's famous for his pivots. I don't know if it's failure
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.240]   Now so that's the other so
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.640]   There's a couple of things
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:09.320]   If you are running a company with a very long term in mind and I don't know a lot of executives that do this well
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.360]   Um, you have to be operating across different time zones sort of simultaneously meaning
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:19.960]   You have to have a strong sense of what you're doing in the further future like 10 years down the road which feels
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.160]   Pointless, but you there are still data that you can track
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:30.760]   Um and in the in the present you have to make tactical decisions using data that you do have access to and then strategy and then
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:38.040]   shifting your your vision on you know on on where you're headed and you have to be able to recalibrate and you have to
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.160]   to
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:44.680]   You have to be able to do this pretty regularly. The problem is that I think a lot of companies you've got products separate
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.240]   You've got executives looking at adoption cycles. You've certainly got investors looking at what probable
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.800]   Adoption cycles look like which are always slower than people think they should be
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.680]   You try to build financial models
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.400]   To to match those adoption cycles and
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:04.520]   You know all of these sort of things start to fall apart part of the reason is that
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.800]   Um
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:13.560]   I don't think people are taking in enough outside data like when when they are looking at whether or not something could succeed and what the factors are
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.960]   There's they're not using a big enough data set and there and then there's a lot of teams that aren't doing this using data at all
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:25.960]   Um or more methodically at all. You just wind up with belief. It's fiat. Everybody gets really excited about something and then
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.760]   That's that and in the middle of all this
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.640]   You need to have somebody who is
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.880]   Um asking some is really difficult questions and building a risk model doesn't need
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.360]   You know a month and a half. It sometimes just means needs like a couple of hours
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.680]   To think things through and if you wait and by the way, there are tools to do this
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.760]   It's not like idle brainstorming
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.000]   But if you identify that risk early enough in in
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.440]   That could result from the normal cycle of product development
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.040]   You mitigate that early and you turn that into a strategic advantage
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.920]   Or you deal with it or at least you know that it's plausible on the horizon
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.080]   And I just I think that sometimes people get very stuck in doing what they know how to do especially if they came out of
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.560]   development, um or product space
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:16.120]   And the rest of this work given how little most
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.080]   Companies and most people control
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.480]   Outside, it's like this is really challenging stuff to do but you have to do it
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:26.360]   Uh
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:33.560]   Jack dorsey along with uh sundar patchiah mark succuburg testified to the house energy and commerce
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.440]   uh committee this week
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.000]   at one point
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.400]   Dorsey was asked by uh mike doil of
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.000]   Pennsylvania whether social media services contributed to the spread of misinformation
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.280]   That led to the january sixth insurrection
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.280]   Actually asked all three executives dorsey was the only one to say yes
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.600]   He said uh, uh, we did contribute to that
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:05.400]   But he also said you have to take into consideration the broader ecosystem. It's not just the technological systems we use
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.840]   but
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   Yeah, it'd be interesting if there is anything twitter could have done back in 2006
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:17.240]   To avoid their ceo happening to sit in front of congress saying yeah, I thought would have been that would have been early
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.840]   Yeah, 20. Oh, it would have been early. You know, but they would start when they first started up
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:27.480]   They would they would after they started succeeding what what point did they start thinking about?
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:34.200]   At some point if you are working on a serious business model and you're you know, your your goal is to grow a business
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:41.000]   I think um then then you have to start prioritizing and one of the things you have to prioritize is you know
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:45.640]   How do some of these potentially how do some of these things go wrong? I mean I again I
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:48.440]   I can't I can't say the companies
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:55.080]   But we work with a lot of these companies on strategy on planning on their strategy
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.600]   And it's totally appropriate to factor in risk
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.840]   In a way that doesn't set you up to a future class class action lawsuit
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.640]   Which you don't want a way that doesn't stymie your product development on the other hand, you know if mark zuckerberg
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:14.120]   When he's at harvard planning facebook or or have williams when he's you know sitting in south park thinking about twitter
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.200]   Imagining the success and all of that
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:23.720]   It's it's hard to imagine them also imagining sitting in front of a congressional
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.560]   committee
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:32.360]   Having to justify how their products use and and if they had the the answer they might have come up with is oh, we shouldn't do this
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.480]   We shouldn't start facing we shouldn't start we knew
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.400]   We knew that that twitter is being used for russian propaganda pretty early on in the process. How do you stop that?
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.360]   Well, you
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.000]   You make a rule no russian propaganda
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   You can block ip's I mean there's a lot of things that could have been done
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.320]   It's very
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:02.440]   I'm not saying it's an easy solution. I am saying you got to be aware of the thing not to do is just pretend like it's not happening
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.720]   Yeah
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:07.000]   Does that make sense kevin? I mean you work with a lot of startups and a lot of companies
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.440]   Yeah, I agree 100% that you you have to first come out and say this is happening and this is an issue
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.360]   You can't pretend and just kind of you know shove it under the rug
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.920]   They kind of they kind of they kind of bit and I don't want to think about this
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:28.440]   I think in you know after it happened they came out and reluctantly said, you know, it's probably a bigger problem than we first said
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.480]   But I I just don't know the solution
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:37.400]   Like I just I don't know even a technology standpoint. I can't even imagine there's just ways around everything
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:41.480]   When you allow everyone to have a microphone the second they confirm an email address
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.160]   I just don't like how do you fix the nature of the business? That's what I mean when I say maybe had they really thought about it
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:51.640]   They said well, we should we should have a dog walking company instead. I mean it's not no
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.440]   It's it's being willing so this this brings me back to pivot because I know pivots kind of a bad word
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.080]   Right and then and the assumption is that there's a failure
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.560]   Um, I think if you're a really really smart
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:06.920]   Leader if you're a smart executive you should be micro pivoting all the time because what does that mean?
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:11.240]   It means your take it means that you acknowledge you don't have certainty over everything
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:18.600]   There are new data that present themselves all the time and you are reacting to those data by recalibrating your march to the future
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:23.720]   So like really really great ceos are constantly making adjustments
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.920]   um
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.920]   I think the issue is
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:32.360]   And that's what you do. I mean that I think marx Zuckerberg is constantly making adjustments
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:37.000]   To the algorithm to what facebook means. I mean you could see it over and over again new products
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.360]   Abandoned products. There's no question mark is micro pivoting every day of his life
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.480]   But my I think the problem with marx Zuckerberg is what his priorities are
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.040]   What to what end is are those micro pivots? Uh, you know
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:56.120]   Being accomplished there now. He's not trying to figure out how to be a better
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]   global citizen
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]   He's trying to make up more profitable company
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.520]   Right is is
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.160]   That's actually a fundamental
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.200]   Uh question that we ask all the time is is the nature of business?
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:18.680]   I mean, is it not your your you know responsibility to your stakeholders to maximize profit?
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.080]   Is the nature of any business enterprise?
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.120]   Essentially a moral that your job is to maximize profit and nothing else
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.320]   I mean, it does is a mark
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.160]   I do think that's because that's what he does
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.720]   Do you so?
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.160]   Do you think that that's the same is true for amazon if you look at your thing returns
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.640]   And we may as this is yes
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.520]   Bezos is brown off or was brilliant. He's retired
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:48.360]   Yeah, but I don't know if Bezos is like 100% modus operandi is returning value to shareholders
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:54.920]   Oh, I guarantee. Oh, I guarantee I don't I don't know they got they got spanked pretty hard for a pretty big rnd investment
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.480]   I think I don't know. I have a different opinion than most people on Bezos and I
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:04.360]   I have no horse and in any of these races amazon's not a client. I'm not trying to impress anybody
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.960]   It's not that I think he's operating on a completely different
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:12.040]   He's strategic playing field. He's strategic, right?
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:16.040]   I think he's one of the greatest long-term thinkers alive. No question. That's probably
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.040]   And to what end is he strategic?
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.760]   um
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.600]   if you look at the constellation of investments and
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.000]   businesses and
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.760]   all the varied things that amazon has its fingers and
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.040]   It is very clear to me that these aren't crapshoots
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:40.520]   And I don't think it's about returning maximum value shareholders. I think they are building something dominant
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:44.680]   Bigger dominant dominant. Yeah. Yeah, but to what end?
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:49.480]   To be the most successful corporation in the history of the world
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.520]   and to and what is success
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:58.280]   Or is it about changing the way that society functions? Do you think he you think he's thinking that?
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.640]   I do. I think part of that is
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.360]   Um more optimized place maybe optimized
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:09.640]   um optimized for
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.640]   happiness
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.840]   um
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.360]   I think that given given what I know about his
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.560]   love of star trek
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.520]   Um, yeah, he wants to go to he wants to go to space
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.760]   Well, it's not just that uh the original star trek what had imagined a truly utopian. Yeah
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.480]   a better a better society you could see that in the selections of the cast
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:37.400]   No, I totally can believe that that's what jeff bazos is trying to do
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:43.720]   The problem is there's a lot of hubris involved and he's an individual and his own personality
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:50.600]   Brings his own judgment to this and maybe what he's not saying it's perfect
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.080]   You know, I'm just saying if I look at his utopia drivers might be peeing in their vans is all i'm saying
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.480]   Oh, yeah, no in his utopia. It may be uh, it may be like
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:06.280]   Slaughter everybody who gets them into in the way of this dream. Yeah, so i'm not saying that that's yeah
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:14.360]   Um, but but I am saying I don't think I don't know. I don't know him personally. So I don't know what his actual
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:20.760]   His actual desire is but he looks brilliant. That's no there's no question. It seems to me given what I
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:25.320]   Observe the company doing and how they are doing it that there are other factors in play
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:31.320]   This is not about building just money most lucrative. I don't think it's that I don't I don't know that I would say it's an eyesight effect
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:37.240]   Yeah, yeah, sure it's pretty good side effect. He's the richest man in the world
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:45.480]   Right, but if you it's it's not money at that point once you have no I understand he after the first billion
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.600]   It's as bill gates once said it's your infinitely. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Right. It's what you can
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.240]   Do and at that level you can make fundamental
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:59.400]   Decision you can make decisions that change the course of all of humanity
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.360]   And I think that's what he is you think kevin. I think that's what the what the jeff bazors was up to you
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:08.680]   Yeah, I mean, I I believe that um in terms of
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.480]   I think that
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.760]   You're absolutely right in that these are not just random lucky events like he's one of the best long-term thinkers
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:20.200]   Like there's no doubt. I believe that five 10 years from now
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   It will be the most valuable company in the world
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:27.880]   then I think it'll hold that position for quite some time they've they've built out the infrastructure for the future and
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:35.000]   Uh, yeah, I don't see it as an evil corporation as much as I do like a facebook though for some reason
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.640]   uh, no, I don't either although
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.400]   Having watched a lot of star trek
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.120]   Uh, I do understand that no wait a minute. Which star trek? I love the original
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:53.960]   Let's get this out of the way the original star. Okay. Okay. You know that no single human should have the right to decide how
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:58.760]   Life is lived. No human has sufficient perspective to do that
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:03.480]   and so uh a jeff bazors designed utopia is
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.520]   I think by definition
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:12.120]   Not going to be ideal for every human alive and he should know better than to say I can do that
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.520]   That's fine. What I would say back to you is are we not already living in part of that?
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.160]   Well, maybe yeah, maybe he's in the United States
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:25.640]   Okay, can I just operate at companies, right? Yeah, it's like three tech companies that control everything we do
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.240]   Yeah, that's that's why congress is a little late to the game
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:36.760]   If i'm finding these people in to talk to us. It might be more than three. I think uh, I think you amie and your book identified
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:41.320]   Five right six uh six that's called the jeem offia. Yeah, google
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.480]   Microsoft
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.800]   apple facebook ibm and amazon is ibm still in that list
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.680]   ibm is is starting to fall now that watson has been uh, uh,
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.960]   relegated to the closet
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.200]   Can I can I tell you about a garbage can yes
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:04.200]   Okay, so there's this little device that you can hook onto your garbage can that is powered
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:09.880]   And you scan it so that's a garbage scanner. So when you throw something away, you scan whatever it is
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.680]   um, and then
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.520]   poof magically
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.480]   Uh, a replacement of that shows back up at your house
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:24.920]   So you watch is this like is this the genie can it is it is what?
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.000]   Now
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.360]   Bear with me for a moment with this little tiny thought exercise
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.040]   So what do we know to be true of amazon? We know that at the moment?
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.840]   Amazon is not the backbone of our health care. However, we do know it sure want to be yeah
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.080]   They sure they sure want to be a big player one of our advertisers amazon pharmacy
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.280]   So, okay, they want to be which was pill pack which was right so that has changed the name by the way
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.800]   Very good at creating anybody who wants to advertise on twitter
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:57.160]   I just want to give you a little heads up pretty much half the companies of advertise here were bought by amazon
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:03.080]   So I don't know what that is but I can give you a list including pill pack and audible and on and on
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.560]   So, okay, so so you've got this genie cam thing
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:12.200]   Right, you've got this little attachment on your garbage can and you don't ever have to shut us and
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.560]   So we know that amazon's in logistics. We know that they're getting into
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:19.720]   Not just pharmaceuticals, but health care records management
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.760]   management um ehr's emr's
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:30.600]   Uh ai to help doctors transcribe things brick and mortar health care all of these logistics right all of these different things
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.960]   So could we imagine a future in which if you are
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:39.720]   Receiving some type of public health care
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:47.000]   Public insurance that you throw away that bag of cheetos and a replacement bag of carrots shows up instead
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.240]   Right they look similar, but one is arguably much more healthy and it's an effort to optimize your life
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.600]   so
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.160]   And maybe maybe at some point
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:04.200]   Food assistance programs become too expensive in this country given our current levels of debt
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:07.000]   And it makes more sense to start privatizing that
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.960]   People are paying using their data instead of you know, I mean there's there's a lot of different ways that the future unfolds
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:20.040]   Um, and and we don't know what course we're on but it's useful to to ask some of these questions
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.560]   Did you know about the genie cam Kevin?
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.920]   I'm buying one right now. I love this
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.160]   I mean, it's just like they're bad. That was not the point of the story
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.840]   Wait a minute. Where do I get one of those?
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:38.760]   Um, no, and maybe I'll get the genie cam
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.160]   For health which replaces your cheetos with carrots. That's a good idea
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.920]   But uh, I do love a lot of the stuff that amazon is doing though
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.760]   I mean the fact that they're getting into pill delivery
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.240]   That's a huge issue in terms of compliance
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:58.200]   Getting people to even pick up. I heard of something like 50% of medications. Just are never even picked up. Wow. Yeah, it's it's crazy
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:01.000]   And the mesh network sidewalk mesh
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.400]   Network so within about a half mile radius if you're in the neighborhood mesh
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.440]   Uh, you know, you can find your keys find your kid
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:15.000]   Communicate whatever it is that you need to do and again like who oh man who should be building these
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.520]   Listen, I don't I don't know what we do. I don't see how the the antitrust
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.720]   Arguments being levied at amazon are gonna hold up
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.080]   So and I and I also don't see our government running out to build a lot of this infrastructure
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.080]   so
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.480]   Again, I I look at it. I'm not yes
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.120]   There are horrible things that are happening in that company
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.360]   But I also look at that company and I look at the people running it and it's hard not to be in awe
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.120]   Of what they are doing what they're doing is clearly more than trying to return value to shareholders
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:51.880]   Yeah, so I kind of straight out of a science fiction a novel or tv show in this case
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.400]   um
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:58.440]   By the way, I'm really disappointed the genie can store cannot accept payments right now
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.960]   What kind of cabin this is like the worst your start your founders worst nightmare. Here's a guy
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.600]   I'm trying to buy this thing 150 bucks
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:12.120]   And this everybody's listening right now and they crashed it. It looks like it looks like a shopify check out
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.120]   Is it not a shopify shut down? Yeah, are they out of business? What happened?
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.840]   I'm trying to order this damn thing
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:28.840]   So by the way, uh, I'm sorry your whole point was lost as soon as you said genie can my whole point is
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.840]   That I understood. I'm kidding. I'm teasing. It's about optimizing
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.800]   Yes, and the question is is amazon really the optimization store the optimization company
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.560]   Yes, right and if that's true then there are some parts of that that are really good
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:48.200]   There are also questions. We ought to ask about who's optimized whose version of utopia is okay with us
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:53.160]   Right who's optimizing from for but here's a problem. We don't get to vote
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.280]   Right
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:58.280]   I mean, I might not like it
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.160]   Uh, I guess I can not shop at amazon, but good luck staying away from amazon if
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.360]   You know and by the way, the next step after amazon pharmacy starts delivering my meds
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:14.840]   Is they starting to get big enough to start negotiating with the pharma companies for a better deal pretty soon?
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.920]   Uh, i'm getting better prices from amazon pharmacy than I am from my doctor
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:26.280]   And pretty soon. I don't get to vote right. It's your isn't that Costco today though
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:30.200]   Yeah, the reason why people get their meds there. Well, I get my hot dogs there
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.800]   Those are their pizza their pizza is good very favorably priced
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.640]   Clearly
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.760]   Equality quality is a piece of this so you can buy glasses there too
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.520]   But the lenses that you're gonna get in those classes they may be much more affordable
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.200]   But they're not good lenses right and if you I work glasses
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.840]   I've worn them since I was little if that's you you know, it's your husband's an ophthalmologist
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.920]   So I know you take this stuff seriously
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.640]   Well, I don't take any of it seriously
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:05.240]   So you you have to pay attention at least it's really an interesting story. Are we entering a brave new world?
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.360]   I guess
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.000]   I mean, it's just basically what we're talking about is a bunch of closed loop systems that are going to create
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:18.040]   beautiful optimizations so like and sometimes scary ones but like, you know, for example, I wear a continuous glucose monitor right now
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.120]   That's one biomarker today and
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:27.800]   In 10 years, it'll be 10 biomarkers that will feed into my dynamic insurance pricing right same goes with tesla auto insurance
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.440]   Which are now offering they know how you drive and so they give you cheaper rates if you drive more conservatively interesting
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.440]   It's all just it's all happening. There is a rebellion against this too though
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:40.840]   I mean a lot of the stories where we have here are things like google's flock
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.560]   and
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.080]   you know the
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.560]   privacy blockers and the ad blockers there's a rebellion against this as well
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:53.080]   Are people fighting against their own interest by saying don't track me man?
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:56.760]   I the numbers don't support these are micro
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.600]   It's a tiny note. It's the people I know it's not the world
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:07.800]   No, because at some point either the technology becomes so difficult that you cannot get through the world
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.360]   Without it on your own
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.760]   Or the convenience just totally outweighs we've seen that you know remember the the New York Times article
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.360]   Where I don't remember Taylor Lawrence or
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:25.880]   No, it was cashmere hill. It was a wonderful story. She did. I'm not going to use the big four. Good luck
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:32.200]   Yeah, or just like how many people posted a black square on instagram on that one day. Yeah, that really changed the world
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.400]   and like
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:39.480]   Totally changed the world exactly. Yeah. No, I mean and and did there did their d i use drop did there? I may use drop
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.960]   You know, no, not that I know which is again to my point. I don't get a vote
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.040]   uh
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.480]   Or do I how can how can consumers how can users how can all of us?
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:55.080]   Impact what is happening? Can we
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:00.200]   I think we can it's it's by the individual incremental decisions
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.640]   We all make every single day
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:05.640]   I mean people who have been listening to the show with me on it for all these years know that I
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.840]   You know, we we provisioned a network for my daughter and we've
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:15.880]   an alternate reality. Yeah, it's one tiny thing that we did that is our way of trying to
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:21.720]   You know optimize for us, which is not like the parents who say don't use any technology
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:24.840]   I want you to grow up like I did because you recognize
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:29.000]   That your child is going to enter a world where all of this is in
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.280]   Operate and you can't avoid it. So it would be foolish to not prepare a child for the world that she's about to enter
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:43.560]   Right again. I think it's about being so this is this is this is the hard thing. Um, it's about being flexible and flexibility
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.960]   means
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.880]   sort of continuously
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.880]   Staying plugged in and paying attention and
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:55.080]   And making many many incremental decisions and that takes a lot of extra first of all
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:59.480]   It means you have to accept uncertainty, which is very hard for people to do it makes you feel anxious
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:04.280]   And too, it means you have to to continuously confront cherish beliefs and make decisions
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.640]   None of these things are things that your brain is neurologically wired to want to do
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.120]   and therefore we don't want to do those things, but my feeling is if you're
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.080]   If you are willing to
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:23.800]   Be flexible meaning you're willing to accept uncertainty and to make decisions all the time using new data
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:28.200]   That's how we have to be now. Yeah. Yeah, that's the way it is
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.920]   Kevin has your blood sugar right now. Is it good?
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:34.440]   Do you want to get a snack? It's 102 right now perfect
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.960]   And that's right on my apple watch around that outside the display. Perfect. It's crazy. Really, you know it all times
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.840]   That's awesome. I would like it to be a little lower than that, but
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:48.200]   Anything around there is good. That's good. What's a good number? I don't know these things
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.760]   Well, you don't want to be over too high over 100
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:53.400]   Yeah, I mean maybe it depends on what you've just eaten
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.840]   But if you're in a like i'm in somewhat fast to stay at having it eaten for a few hours
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.840]   So I'd like to be in the god it should be like seven high eighties. Yeah, like yeah
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:05.000]   If you haven't eaten at all, it shouldn't be seven. He would be like stellar. I bet a coma
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:12.200]   Okay, okay interesting. Yeah, I kind of I embrace you were the guy who told me about the aura ring first
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.200]   You actually I learned about the fit bit from you
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:21.720]   Uh, so you've always been into this quantified self thing a little bit. I love it
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.640]   I just I love seeing more about my real-time dashboard
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:31.720]   Um, I just did something crazy the other day. So two days ago. There's a startup
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:38.840]   Um, they're based in in the bay area on red redwood city called pre nouveau p re in uvo
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.200]   And they have essentially taken
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:46.680]   What would be like one of these these whole body scans that amorize that you can get done
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.680]   And you know if you get the MRI done on your on your brain. That's typically a
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.400]   Process that takes about
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:59.240]   45 minutes to an hour just on your brain. They can now do a whole body like head to toe MRI in one hour
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:02.760]   And give you back a detect stage one cancer
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.400]   Nine and a ten cancers that are detectable by in MRI. They can detect at stage one
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.920]   Take a look at this video right here. Let's see if I can get it to focus
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.080]   I might have to turn off the blurry is it on the website. Can I play it on the website?
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:17.800]   Uh, well, I was actually showing you my body scan. That's you
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:22.120]   Oh, yeah, you gotta turn off that background thing you go and it thinks the phone thing
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.320]   It thinks the phone is behind you or something. Yeah, you're gonna see my spare bedroom
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:29.560]   But let me turn this off. We can scan the body, but we can't get the screen to focus
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:35.080]   Yeah, doctors hate this by the way, don't they because uh, this is
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:40.840]   In the early 2000s. They were oh wow. That's an MRI of you
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:43.480]   Yeah, and they gave that to me same day
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:48.200]   That's and they were looking for all different types of cancers. Did they find anything? Are you okay?
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:53.160]   No, I'm totally fine, but it gives me a good benchmark to have this for you know brain size over time
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:57.960]   My mom has dementia so just tracking that closely sure, um, it's a thousand bucks
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:03.400]   Yeah, it depends on which scan you want to do if you want to do the but it oh it could be more than that
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.880]   That's just the torso scan if you want heads or torso at 1799
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.080]   But the long term vision here is they want to be at 500 dollars
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.480]   That's that's the price point there and me for in the next couple of years
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:15.560]   Yeah, because these machines are expensive
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.440]   Do you get what kind of files that store it on and where is it?
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:23.160]   Uh in terms of like, uh, is it is a hip a compliant kind of digital storage?
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.840]   No, no like uh, how do you give it to my doctor? 20 years. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.520]   Oh, yeah, so it's it's in the the they sent it to the doctor
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:35.080]   That's a great question. I don't know the file format for these scans, but it's uh in a typical
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.680]   Whatever they send MRIs around in is but I was looking at bone density and oh, yeah, look at
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:45.560]   Actually, this is kind of crazy. Check this one. I'll show you it's like a little bit like
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.560]   Go ahead show his show his, uh
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.320]   little
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.640]   John thought maybe maybe there's a fig leaf though. It's okay. We're not seeing anything. We uh, we should
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:58.760]   Look at your bone density. Wow. So kevin did they did they give that to you with any
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:05.320]   Context or was it was it like? Oh, yeah, yeah, they give you a no they give you a full breakdown of of every different
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:08.280]   uh region of the body what it means like the
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:14.600]   Have a couple discs that are starting to divulge a tiny bit like all the stuff that you'd want to know they they give you the full report
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:18.520]   It is my sense that doctors are not fond of these
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:24.040]   Third party scanners. What is your the crazy thing those one and 20 people that come in there?
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:27.880]   They told me something's wrong. They find it like a stage one of stage two cancer and they're able to
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:33.080]   Address it. No, it's great though because they can just go in there do a quick snip or something in most cases
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:36.520]   They don't have to do chemo. They can catch it at stage one. It's massive
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:40.920]   There was in the early 2000s. I think they were
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:45.160]   They you could go to shopping malls and get a full body tomo
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:51.000]   Yeah, remember that yeah, I just got a solicitation in the email for you know like the traveling tomogram
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.240]   That will right and I know doctors really hated that but and MRI is much more
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.720]   first of all safe
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:03.160]   Okay, and um, and I think you detect more. I don't know. I think there's some concern too that
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.560]   uh
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.680]   People
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:10.280]   will get over concerned about things that aren't concerning or
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:17.800]   Yeah, there are there is certainly the the chances of hypercontery. Right like that's gonna that's gonna happen, but um
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.440]   You know, then then you do follow-ups, right?
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:24.280]   Like if you see something that they can't they can't tell you whether it's cancer or not then you can go
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.120]   I had a friend that went in for a scan
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.880]   They saw a little something odd in her lung
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.040]   And they said okay. Well great now come back in six weeks and we're gonna see if anything's changed
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:37.240]   Nothing had changed. They said okay. This was most likely always been there
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:41.320]   Don't worry about it and you know, but that type of stuff can happen
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.520]   And that's the kind of thing your physician would like to be
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:51.000]   Part of oh they get yeah your primary care provider gets all the data right away. So they send it at the same time. Okay
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.480]   We should ask why like why why is the assumption that everybody's going to be anxious and
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.640]   Freak out, you know, and that this this is bad. It's bad to have this information and
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.560]   I think unlike Japan and china for example
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:12.120]   Where you know from a very young age much more about your body you you have a much better handle on your personal
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.280]   Like everybody knows what their temperature is. We don't assume that it's 98.6
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:21.880]   Um, we don't have that culture of preventative care in the United States and so I
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.240]   I think there's this sense that people will
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.600]   um
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.520]   worry because we we haven't ever been exposed to what it's like to have
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.720]   Met to have some understanding what's going on inside of your body
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:37.000]   How often do they recommend that you do this?
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.920]   Kevin do you do it once or you do every every couple of years
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:44.280]   2500 bucks for the for the full magilla
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:49.720]   But the the prices will be dropping I had a chat with the ceo and and he's he's like
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:55.400]   We're gonna get this to 500 and hopefully get insurance to cover it as well because you can imagine they're gonna save a ton of money if they
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.880]   Insurance no insurance doesn't
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:05.400]   So that's I think a common misconception about health insurance in this country because people move around
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.520]   They don't want to do preventative care. It's too expensive
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:14.440]   They presume that if you've got something it's the next guy that's going to be paying for that not that right and that's a problem
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.520]   That's a big problem. Obviously
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.360]   We we are very close to doing full genome sequencing
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.720]   Sinquent full genome sequencing at birth right so
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.320]   Before that baby leaves you've got the sequence. That's another problem pretty
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.720]   Well, but I mean
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:39.960]   These this would be a good thing because like I I know that I've probably got genetic predisposition for some things
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:42.280]   But I lost my mom at a very very early age
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:49.400]   I don't have I don't have anybody to ask you know, right and we that's who we tend to rely on
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:53.080]   You've got a period of data over time. Yeah
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:58.040]   Have you uh, Amy have you taken your 23andme data? Take it you've done that
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:04.440]   Yeah, I've done and have you taken into external analyzers like the ones that really look deeper than what 23andme will tell you
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.760]   Oh, you can because 23 and you can export your data. You can export it. I've had
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:13.240]   Yeah, I'm a I'm a big believer in um in
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.040]   Getting as much of your own
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:18.760]   Data that you can as you can so I should do that
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:23.960]   So so you send it to a third party and they get the data and they they know more than 23andme
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.000]   Why doesn't 23andme do that? Well 23andme is just super conservative. Oh, yeah
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.320]   They don't want to tell you you might have a
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:39.320]   For you could have higher rate of dementia, you know, but uh found my fitness is uh the site to go through ronda patrick
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:45.000]   She's a great scientist. She has a team of scientists that are basically all they do is they say if you have this genetic snip
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:49.800]   You if you have this genetic polymorphism, it has it is tied to these research papers
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:55.320]   That should that you might have an elevated chance. That's x y or z right? So it just is showing you more
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:01.240]   The yeah, that's that's her site. Yeah and genetic report up the top there. I think she gives it away
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.400]   It's it's not much. It's maybe $20 or something
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:12.040]   It charges a lot for it, but yeah, take your um your 23 so you have no concern about 23andme having your spit and having your genome and
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.200]   Yes, I do you do I do yeah, but I especially since now
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:22.040]   Apparently they've done a spec with virgin and richard ranson has your spit now
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:25.240]   I I like immediately when they launched
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:30.280]   Um because I knew they were they were coming. I guess this is me not thinking through things
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:33.640]   I didn't occur to me. I was also desperate at that point. We were trying to do
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:40.120]   We were trying to get some some genetic data for other reasons and any I at that at that point
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:46.200]   It was like contraband so I had to order it through a friend and have the friend like yes it to me because um
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.000]   Contraband DNA tests
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.640]   There are others as a personal genome project. I mean, there's a ton of places. Yeah, I tried to sign up for that
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:57.960]   But they they didn't take me but uh I you know, I know I don't care
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:03.960]   Somebody pointed out you probably should your kids might care because they are your genotype so they might
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:09.960]   They're product of your genotype. So they might have some concern the information about you
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.600]   Might apply to them as well
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:14.120]   eh
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:19.560]   Hey, I thought about actually taking it and putting it on the blockchain and making the first nft genome brilliant
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.680]   Um, I'll buy it. It'll be the first I'll buy it
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:29.000]   Kevin actually that's a wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's not a joke. That's actually a really interesting
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.840]   Idea, right? I really found doing that the genotype. It does have value, right?
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:38.440]   Especially if you combine it with a female. No, no, I mean the okay
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:43.880]   So wait here's where this gets really really interesting. It's anonymized theoretically it is
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.680]   It's just code. It's just right
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:52.280]   That's what that's what that's what there is a way to establish ownership over it
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:55.800]   The personal genome project was very clear that we are not going to keep this
[01:59:55.800 --> 02:00:01.240]   Secret if you sign up to do this because it's the site of the research church and a couple of
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:04.920]   It was in the day the pool of it was estradyson and george
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:11.000]   There were a handful of people who did it. Yeah, I tried it and you had to pay like 10 grand because it was a full genotype
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.720]   But I tried to do it. It's like it's like less it costs less than a pair of air for now. I know I know I know
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.160]   Yeah
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.960]   There's a company in china called bci but kevin. I don't know
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:24.920]   That's really interesting
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:28.600]   Okay, you guys think about kevin's nft
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.320]   On his jeans
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:36.840]   We're gonna take a little break and then if you can clone me do you own future versions of me?
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.080]   Yes, and you get 10 percent of all clones
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:42.920]   And if if I have a company that's yeah, you get royalties on all future clones
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:49.560]   If my company is the one that paid for the clone then is it the parent company who owns the clone?
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.080]   That owns the who's the parent who gets to make the decisions
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:56.120]   Yeah
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:58.120]   This is why I don't like the future
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:01.720]   Don't like it legally. There's nothing preventing me
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:07.800]   From having a company and going into an iaf center and using the company to pay out of pocket
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:12.280]   And therefore the ownership would tie back to the company not to the person
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:14.920]   First we got to invent cloning though
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:17.480]   It is invented. Oh, okay
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:21.160]   I mean it doesn't well can't make a sheep
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:27.640]   You can make a sheep that dies early but other than that we got it down
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:31.560]   No, I didn't do it all sorts of we're doing dogs now. Yeah, yeah, they're doing dogs
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:35.960]   Yeah, you can clone your dog. That's right and those do they live a normal life span the clones?
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:43.960]   I don't know, but mr. Toast is 10 years old. Yeah, it might be time to think about that get the clone toaster is a pretty much a perfect dog
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:46.760]   Uh, he's the best
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:52.600]   I would clone toaster if I if I were toaster's owner you should put toaster on the blockchain
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:57.320]   But I could put his genome on the blockchain. I'm telling you people would love it
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:01.160]   I could never clone toaster though like, you know when you love something like that
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:04.200]   There's only one there can be only one toaster
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:07.880]   I can tell you where to go to get the toasters DNA sequence though
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:10.840]   It's in china right DCI
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.240]   Gia BC is BCI. Yeah. Yeah, this is like an episode
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:19.640]   And dji got together and made drones drones
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:23.240]   clone drones
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:27.080]   This is like an episode of futurama. I don't know what's going on too far
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.600]   Our show today is brought to you by mint mobile. I'll tell you one thing
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.040]   You don't want to give any more money to the big wireless providers those guys suck
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:42.440]   After years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big wireless if we've learned anything
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:47.240]   We've learned there's always a catch. There's always a hidden fee. There's always something
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.920]   So I have to admit when I first heard about mint mobile, I thought
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:56.680]   Premium's wireless service for $15 a month. What's the catch?
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.560]   There isn't one in fact. I've been a happy mint mobile customer for more than a year now
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:05.880]   Mint mobile secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:08.280]   online only
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:15.400]   No stores means no crazy overhead and they pass the savings directly to you. It's really a a brilliant
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:23.640]   Brilliant plan. How much do you pay for your wireless service provider 50 60 70 80 bucks a month?
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:26.520]   Why?
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:31.800]   Why when you could get unlimited talk and nationwide talk and text high-speed data
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.760]   On the nation's largest 5g network. You can bring your own phone
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:39.800]   They'll send you the sim for free other companies will charge you for the sim
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.640]   They don't even charge you for the sim
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:46.440]   So your contacts go along you can even have your phone number transferred port it over to mint mobile
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:53.080]   And if for any reason you're unhappy they've got a seven-day money back guarantee switch now to mint mobile get premium
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.840]   Wireless service. It's such a great deal. Why are you paying more? I'm literally paying a third
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:02.040]   For the exact same service
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:08.920]   To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door free go to mint mobile.com slash twit
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:12.120]   Cut your wireless bill is $15 a month

[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.760]   Oh, what other future things can we talk about?
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.560]   I know you know every time the tech CEOs go to congress
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:56.200]   The only thing I come away from with this is how little congress understands
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:58.920]   What they're what they're talking about?
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:07.160]   Are did you did you see any of it? Amy? Did you follow any of it? Did you get any sense that any of the members of congress had any idea?
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:12.360]   What they were asking or what they were talking about. I feel like it was just they
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.040]   It's politics
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.360]   here's the
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.320]   Washington DC are the the people who run the the legislative branch
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.160]   um
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.160]   sort of ignores
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.240]   ignores
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:37.320]   What's happening in tech until they perceive there is a problem right in their worldview of what they're what the problems are is kind of limited
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.880]   To the beltway. It's like well the problem is a beltway problem, you know
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:45.240]   Right and I'm sure you guys saw on twitter
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:53.160]   Really rare shift amazon was publicly railing against um center warren and uh
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.800]   Yeah, they're scared. They're scared
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:59.160]   Right, so I don't know if they're scared or
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:03.000]   I'm not sure. I don't know what was happening on the comms like at the comms team on that day
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.440]   But the the incendiary tweets I think started on friday. Yeah, that can't help that really cannot help
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:14.760]   We're pretty and they're continuing. They're pretty they're they're pretty intense for amazon, which is historically
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.120]   Yeah, that's according to recode. It was because jeff bezos was pissed. He was pushing the comms team
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:23.160]   So
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:25.640]   I don't know we we used to have something in this country
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:29.480]   which a lot of twit listeners know about because we
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:30.840]   um
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:34.440]   Talk about this a little bit, but it's it was called the office of technology assessment and
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:37.880]   the job of that group was to inform
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.560]   um the
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.000]   legislative branch
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.680]   Uh before they came up with policy and voted and everything else to help them understand basic science and tech
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:49.400]   Um, and it was a non partisan
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:56.040]   Research group that that got defunded in the 90s. We don't really have a replacement. There's a federal foresight community
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:59.800]   There's a couple of pockets of activity here and there. There are a lot of external
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:03.000]   thinkings who some of whom do a pretty good job, but
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.120]   ultimately
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:07.320]   uh
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:08.200]   if
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.200]   we have we have a vacuum and so
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:16.520]   You know, it's fun to make fun of our legislators not asking questions that make any sense
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:20.520]   Yes, it's political theater. Yes, but the problems don't go away
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:23.160]   and so
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:28.280]   The you know in the meantime, we've got a geopolitical foe on the other side of the world that's pressing at china
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:33.240]   That is pressing ahead and has dominant showing it's that that it is a
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:35.960]   militaristic economic and and
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:41.400]   Technological pacing threat. So so we we got to get our acts together over here
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:44.680]   the tweet from uh, dave clark
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:50.120]   who uh is uh ceo at amazon's uh consumer
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:52.040]   division
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:57.240]   There's a little actually a sub tweet against bernie sanner's a welcome senator sanner's deburming ham
[02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:01.160]   Because of course, uh alabama's where there's the unionization push
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:04.120]   And appreciate his push for a progressive workplace
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:13.000]   I often say we're the bernie sanner's of employers, but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace now
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:20.040]   Uh, 15 dollar minimum wage health care from day one career progression and a safe and inclusive work environment
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.760]   So if you want to hear about 15 dollars an hour in health care
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:24.920]   Senator sanner's will be speaking downtown
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:30.360]   But if you would like to make at least 15 dollars an hour and have good health care amazon is hiring
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:35.800]   It's a little provocative, but it's providing a factually though. They're not incorrect. Yeah
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:38.200]   um, so at bed good point
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:39.880]   the fact that
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:45.880]   Amazon employees and amazon comms is now doing this in a public form in this particular public form
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:47.880]   They're not doing this in the washington post
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:51.800]   Right doing this on twitter. Well, I think is it is assigned tells you something doesn't it?
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:53.000]   Yeah
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.440]   Bezos has been known to write up editorial or two. I'm sure that
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:59.160]   That may also happen
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:06.440]   Uh, you don't really believe the peeing and bottles thing do you the official amazon news account tweeted if that were true
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:08.520]   Nobody would work for us
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:11.640]   Okay
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:19.800]   Okay, uh a little back and forth with Elizabeth Warren that began with her criticizing the company's tax payments very low
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:23.400]   Uh the amazon news account
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.200]   Quote tweeted Warren with this message
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.200]   This is she she says I don't write the loopholes you exploit amazon
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:37.320]   Your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did admittedly they did get it passed through the senate
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:40.360]   um and then uh
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:47.400]   That was in response to you make the tax laws. We just follow them from amazon, which is also a good point
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:52.840]   Um, I'm just surprised that bad pr for them. I think this might be good pier
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:57.240]   Given the state of the nation. I think there might be people rooting for them after this
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:01.640]   I don't know all of this smacks of when I see these types of
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:10.200]   Important debates taking at taking place and not you know small number of characters on a public platform like this
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:12.920]   It smacks a little bit of like
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:18.920]   People complaining about customer service on twitter because they can't get ahold of people in any in any any other way
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:22.360]   No, that's the only good reason to have a twitter account these days is so you can
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:25.480]   Because i don't know what companies pay attention to twitter
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:32.440]   Uh, and by the way, I think warren took the bait and fell for it because she tweeted
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:38.920]   She was going to fight to break up big tech so you're not powerful enough to heckle. Uh senators was not eat tweets
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.240]   Oops
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:44.360]   She uh, by the way, nothing good ever came
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:47.320]   from a twitter fight
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:50.840]   Take it from me stay stay out of the twitter fights
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:53.400]   senator warren now knows
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.960]   It's just a no win situation. Wow
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.560]   I think amazon wins that exchange. I hate to say it
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:06.760]   I don't know. I think I think I think we all lose because everybody forgets right in five minutes
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:08.440]   Right. Honestly, I
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:10.440]   This is as much as people
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:13.560]   Will we'll talk about whether they like or hate club house?
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:21.000]   The one thing I do like is this is an actual audio like conversation between that is multiple people not recorded and played back later
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.040]   Well, that's true, but you know also twitter has been experimenting with this functionality as well
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:28.280]   Like I've seen it. I don't know if you all have taken place
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.960]   Yeah, it's it's basically a clubhouse room
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:35.560]   But like that would be fascinating like forget that like to your point Leo like these in a small amount of very few characters
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:41.560]   Like a lot gets lost and it comes off weird. Let's have a real dialogue about this stuff. Yeah, maybe that's a solution
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.160]   I don't know
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:46.600]   I don't think it's feasible though because you know that all of these
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:53.720]   Tweets are being lawyered in advance. I mean, they know of course. Yeah, it's all calm. It's like it's hard to lawyer in advance. You're right
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:56.760]   They're not gonna want to they're not gonna want to do that
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:58.840]   Yeah
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:05.000]   I the only thing that really upset me about the hearing was Mark Zuckerberg's willingness to throw the entire tech industry under the bus
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:12.040]   Saying oh, yeah, here's what you do you you only make section 230 protections for
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:18.920]   For companies based on their ability to meet best practices to fight the spread of bad content in other words
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:22.040]   We can do it
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:25.480]   And you shouldn't give section 230 protection to somebody like Leo
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:31.640]   Because you know he doesn't meet best practices to fight the spread of content
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.640]   Um, I think that that is a complete and utter
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:41.960]   How can I say this politely it's disappointing it's disappointing
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:45.960]   Right, however consider the context so we have
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:48.680]   some of the people implicated
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:49.560]   um
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.760]   I recognize that we have listeners that cross a wide spectrum of political views. Yes
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:13:00.520]   So and I I am politically independent. However, we have people who are
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:04.200]   launching networks, um that have historically spread
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:07.080]   Lies misinformation. So
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:13.320]   Given that context there are definitely going to be people listening to it who had listened to that saying
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:19.400]   You know, I don't think we want to exacerbate the current problems that we have right with somebody starting a new
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:21.960]   Should that should that platform?
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:26.040]   Uh, you know enjoy the same protections as we do. So I think he's
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:31.000]   I think about myself and I have a chat room. I we have comments on a forum
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.040]   Uh, we have uh a twitter clone called mastodon twit.social
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.320]   And none of those would be up if I didn't have section 230
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:42.280]   protection against against liability for
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:45.080]   um, you know, uh
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:47.320]   libel and so
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:53.400]   Or slander or misrepresentation. I can't moderate those in any reasonable way mark zucker bird can it's
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:57.720]   Facebook has the wherewithal to do that and to follow best practices
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:03.480]   So it's not going to hurt him if they modify section 230, but it's pulling up the ladder for everybody else
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:08.680]   It's saying yeah, I made it, but uh, what we don't want is any competition
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.160]   I don't know. It's you know what? I don't want to see section 230 changed
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:16.680]   I've yet to see a good proposal for how you would change it
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:24.360]   Um in any reasonable way without hermit hurting the dialogue on the internet and yet I do acknowledge
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.560]   As I you know, this is we've got a problem
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:33.880]   I don't know if you know it's kind of a question a weird question in the weeds that maybe kevin knows the answer to I don't know
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:36.520]   So like, you know solid right?
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.080]   the the new district
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.200]   This is uh, tim burners lee's yeah proposal for
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:50.680]   Uh, you can you own your data and you control it, but you can let it out in some reasonable way. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:53.080]   Well, here's a question
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.800]   if you if you've got a new platform that has totally different architecture that's
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:03.400]   Are you are you grandfathered in with section 230 apply or
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:11.160]   Project nastodon project maelstrom remember project maelstrom that that was that um that was another distributed
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:16.920]   Computing project. Um, it was similar. It's a bit torrent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.560]   Kind of similar idea that would have been impossible to shut down any yeah website
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:28.200]   I just when you're talking about fundamentally different architecture. I don't know. I wonder if these is that what ipf is though. That's uh
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:33.560]   A standard and it's out there and that's the whole idea. It's a distributed internet
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:39.240]   And not so I wonder that's the whole that's it's coming right like they're you're not gonna be able to stop these brave already
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:44.920]   Yeah, yeah brave supports it at the at the default install level
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.320]   Um, it's just a matter of time. Sadly. I don't even know how you shut that down
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:54.920]   I mean in some sense tours kind of that today, but but but you can find the original tour servers and shut them down
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:16:00.760]   Why do you think ipf is unfortunate what you is it? Empower? I just I can imagine
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:02.760]   Yeah, and all the I can imagine
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:07.480]   Yes, exactly. I can imagine there could be a social network for nazis and hate groups
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:12.680]   And they would just not be able to track or shut down the content because it is encrypted
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:17.640]   And you don't know where it's pulling the data from and so you can't shut down the entire network
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:20.920]   So it may be slow like I don't think it's gonna be performant
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:26.120]   But it will exist and it'll be a place where people show those ideas and they propagate and that's scary
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:33.400]   And that's what I was making me think of section 230 in a world in which you've got true like you've you've got that type of distributed network
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:39.000]   I don't even know but we've already kind of doesn't matter. Right? You've already said kevin and I agree with you
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.720]   There's no technological way to shut down nazis
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:48.040]   Right. Yeah, I mean so you could it's whack-a-mole right now, right? Yeah, what it is
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:51.080]   It's like anytime there's a major social network. They jump on it. They
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:55.960]   Try and crush them and there's there's gab and I mean these things are gonna happen
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:58.680]   Well, it's not the technology
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:01.720]   I mean obviously that enables it and it helps the idea of spread
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:05.480]   But the real question is not how do you kill which technology do you kill?
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:07.960]   The question is how do you kill an idea?
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:11.480]   That's the issue if it's out there. We have a different way
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:15.000]   I think it needs to be dealt with in a different way and I don't think
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.600]   Shutting people up is the way to deal with that. I think
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:22.200]   Right, but it also it's like how can you prevent
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:31.400]   The spread of that information in the recruiting process. How can you how can you delay the recruiting process? Yeah, it's definitely a problem. Yeah
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:34.600]   uh down clearly. I look at qanon. I mean
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:43.400]   The origin of story of qanon absolutely blows my mind. I cannot believe like there were there's so many legitimate
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:48.200]   like sounding much more legitimate sounding conspiracy theories, but like
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:51.320]   How did how did that origin story
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:54.200]   make it past
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:59.800]   people's better sensibilities? Yes, there's not even a basement in that pizza parlor
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:07.240]   No, I just so like the the fact that there are that many people that that this story has taken that much of a hold over so many
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:10.200]   People points to much bigger problems. I
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:17.080]   Know there is a question and I I'm not enough of a historian to have an answer. Maybe you guys are
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.200]   Is it worse now than ever?
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:28.520]   Certainly there are better ways to recruit. I mean Facebook and twitter and there are hundreds of ways to recruit so we know we can do that better
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:33.400]   But didn't people believe equally far fetched nonsense
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:36.840]   Forever isn't that the human condition?
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:45.880]   And it spreads well, uh even without facebook and twitter, uh, maybe right but on youtube it spreads really well
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:52.760]   Because you're basically an audience of one. Well, there's that issue of radicalization as well that youtube promotes this and pushes you into this
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.920]   And uh, and it's not just by the way. It's not just uh qanon or
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:02.920]   Or white supremacy. There's there's uh radical terrorism and a lot of areas
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:08.840]   And so if you if you support qanon, you may not support the fact that you know al-kaida also can use
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:11.480]   uh youtube to to uh
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:15.320]   Yeah, I mean we call them these youtube rabbit holes for a reason
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:20.840]   It's because we get a piece of confidence like oh, that's kind of interesting and then it just takes you a step further and step further
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:25.160]   And you know that's it applies to all different types of comments as if they designed it that way
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:31.080]   Yeah, uh, they didn't and but I I mean I always blame I always blame the uh the algorithm
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:37.960]   I always blame the recommendation engine and and I always I think algorithm is really the enemy on facebook and youtube
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:43.400]   Uh and to some degree twitter twitter is less algorithmic, but it's more than it used to be
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:47.960]   If we're all just chronological or they didn't recommend the next thing
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:54.920]   I don't know if it would be a business model the the business model. Well, there we go again. Great. Okay
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:59.960]   So in science there's a concept called dual use and it applies in technology as well meaning
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:07.080]   You've got some fundamental ground breaking shift in technology. Let's say an amount messenger RNA vaccine
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:13.080]   Um that has potential other use cases that are not beneficial or benevolent
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:14.680]   um
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:15.640]   So
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:18.920]   You can't make those go away. You have to again just it's this
[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:25.400]   It's constantly thinking through next order impacts triangulating and making adjustments
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:31.640]   Right, but the but when you have a when you've got a publicly traded company and the fiduciary responsibilities
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:37.720]   You know youtube is going to have to invent a totally different business model or it's going to have to convince everybody to take
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:40.120]   You know that it's going to make less money
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:44.120]   Kevin are you uh, are you uh, do you what's your bit cloud price?
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:49.720]   I don't know what my big cloud price is. I don't I don't know. I had to go pull it up
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:56.120]   You are on you are you are I could buy you on big cloud, right? You could you could buy me. Yes
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:59.640]   And you could buy any twitter user I believe on on big cloud
[02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:04.040]   So this is another this is
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:09.640]   This isn't specifically to create a decentralized social network or is it?
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:15.160]   I mean it is that but I I think that honestly is the kind of worst piece of it
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:19.960]   Um, you know, yeah right now. I'm three thousand seven hundred sixty two dollars and sixty seven
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:22.760]   I'm gonna buy you it's either that or the mr
[02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:29.320]   Higher than elan musk really no el musk is the 84,000. How do I find out what i'm worth on big cloud?
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:34.280]   I'm doing a search for you right now. You got to tie in your account though. Maybe
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:39.560]   I've never tied it and I don't use twitter so I haven't tied it in okay. That's what it is and yeah
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:45.000]   And the last time I checked big cloud was not even like it was so slow that it was like it was
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:49.800]   DDoSed it was very it was hard to use a lot of people jump on and yeah and figure it out
[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:56.760]   It's it's it is a very odd social experiment not not the decentralized social media piece of it
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:58.760]   But the idea that you can say
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:03.080]   That rather than buying a company. I believe that in individual
[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:09.960]   There's value at the individual level and I want to own value in that and so everyone is their own currency at some point
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:12.280]   Um
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:18.360]   I don't know. I don't know how I feel about it, but there's something interesting that my carrington's been pushing it as a censorship resistant platform
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:22.200]   so
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.120]   My mic probably is very interested in finding a censorship resistant
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:28.520]   platform
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:30.520]   I just I am this whole thing
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:33.560]   It's a brave new world
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.880]   That's all I can say
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:39.080]   All right, I want to take a little break. We'll have uh
[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:44.280]   We'll kind of wrap this up in just a bit as much as I don't want to but honestly
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:47.320]   I can't keep these guys for more than three or four hours. They really start to
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:50.840]   Get they'd have to pee in bottles. That's no good. It's true
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:53.720]   Somebody be tweeting about me next
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:57.560]   Our show today. I don't know if you noticed the clean air in our studio
[02:22:57.560 --> 02:23:01.800]   You probably didn't because you haven't nobody's been in here except me and john for a year
[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:06.440]   But we do think it's pretty important to keep that air clean
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:12.440]   Uh, we are all spending a lot more times uh time indoors these days. I think we know by now
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:15.480]   A sick office, you know syndrome and
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:22.840]   Ventilation is very important keeping that air clean is important indoor air can be five times worse than outdoor air according to the EPA
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:26.680]   Molecule is reimagining the future of clean air
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:29.240]   The molecule is not
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:34.600]   Existing filtration technology. It's a scientific breakthrough in air purification called pico
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:38.200]   Or photo electrochemical oxidation
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:45.720]   And it's really actually it's really cool our molecule has a catalyst in it. We change it every I don't know three or four months
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:47.560]   that
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:49.560]   attracts and traps
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:52.600]   Harmful pollutants even very tiny
[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:59.560]   Particles that would pass right through a filter like viruses and bacteria and mold it collects them
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:03.480]   And then it destroys them. It doesn't just trap them. It destroys them
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:06.280]   It's really very cool
[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:12.440]   And there's a molecule right for every size room. There's the molecule air mini for smaller rooms up to 250 square feet
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:17.720]   The original molecule air that we bought at our house actually we have two now one for michael and one for lisa
[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:24.920]   In both bedrooms and then we now have in our studio the molecule air pro for rooms up to a thousand square feet
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:30.600]   And if you are in a medical office or a dental office the molecule air pro rx
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:35.240]   For medical purposes to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:44.040]   Clean indoor air now is more important than ever molecules pico technology meets the performance requirements and fda guidance
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:51.640]   For use in helping reduce the risk of exposure to covet 19 the stars covet two virus in health care settings
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.840]   Of course, you still don't wash your hands and wear your mask and get your vaccine folks
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:03.560]   But it's a nice it's important preventative extra layer of virus protection. We know that we know now ventilation
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:06.280]   air purification absolutely critical
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:12.760]   Molecules technology and filtration systems have been tested and verified by independent party third party labs
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:19.960]   In fact, if you're at all skeptical, I highly recommend you go to the website molecule with a k m o l e k u l e
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.520]   Dot com

[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:16.520]   Here before we go on. Let me just quickly uh show you a little oh, i'm so excited about this little short movie
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:20.600]   We made all about everything that happened this week on twit
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:24.440]   Uh, do you know who ryan caji is if you have little kids you do
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:30.040]   Probably the most successful youtube creator of all 29 million subscribers
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:37.560]   This is from bloomberg business week. There are six-year-olds on youtube who draw larger daily audiences than tucker karleson
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:39.800]   That makes me hairy
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:42.440]   Previously on twit
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:47.240]   Smart tech today, but now we've got somebody who knows a thing or two
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:53.880]   They are a member of the thread group and the zigby alliance as well as brand manager for eve
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:55.720]   It's tim
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:56.520]   hoop
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:58.360]   hands-on photography
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:01.400]   The key thing is to focus on a single lens
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:04.280]   A primal meaning not a zoom lens
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:08.280]   Soon as you take that pet literal first step something in your brain flips and you go
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:11.320]   Oh, well now that i've moved forward, maybe I should also
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:16.760]   Prouch down a little bit and you will get better and better at your photography because your respect use
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:18.680]   tech news weekly
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:24.920]   There have been ongoing stories for quite a while about amazon working workers to a point where
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:27.480]   Uh the the people who are doing the deliveries
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:33.480]   They don't have time to like go off the beaten path and find a restaurant the amazon news responded
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:37.800]   You don't really believe the peen and bottles thing. Do you if that were true?
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.840]   Nobody would work for us vice got in touch with uh some different
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:46.680]   delivery drivers who work for amazon and showed
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.600]   Bottles with your an indum that these amazon delivery drivers have used to
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:59.400]   Uh do their the restroom breaks to it. It keeps going and going and going
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:05.480]   Uh boy, it's I could it's telling the charams that don't ever let this show end, but I think maybe
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:08.680]   Amy and kevin might
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:12.360]   rebel if I never let this show and
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:14.120]   Um
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:21.400]   You sang that song sticks right don't let it don't let it end you are betraying your 1980s heritage right there
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.000]   Uh, new york has launched a vaccine passport
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.640]   Uh that you can pull up a code on your cell phone
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:33.800]   Or print out to prove you've been vaccinated. I have the little cdc card
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:37.160]   Yeah, that's totally not reproducible in anyway
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.840]   Yeah, in fact
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:43.160]   The the word has gone out do not put it on instagram because people will just copy it
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:45.000]   so
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]   So I laminated mine
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:52.280]   Well, then that's a question you can go. I was at office depot no staples offers free lamination
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:58.120]   So I thought i'll go down. I'll get the free donut from christmie cream go over his staples get the free lamination
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:02.680]   But then don't they need to write on it? Amy don't they isn't there first of all?
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:05.880]   What is this free donut you're talking about? Oh, you didn't know about that
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:09.080]   Best there are no free donuts where i'm at. What is this free?
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.040]   Krispy cream best promotion ever
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:15.560]   You go in you show them the card they give you a donut
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:21.560]   Huh is that like a one time? I don't really live every day for the rest of the year you can go back tomorrow
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:25.880]   You can go back for real. Yeah, do you really want to eat that many christmie cream donuts?
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:32.600]   I think christmie creams whatever. I think christmie cream donuts are super gross. I like the uh, they're like way too sweet and uh
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:35.960]   They taste great going down. Uh, i've yet to
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:43.000]   I always always regret eating it no covet but uh you get the diabetes. Yeah, you got that
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.200]   That's good, but you've got the 24 hour diabetes monitor. So you're okay. That's right
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:53.720]   In fact, I want you to go get that donut and then tell us how high I know exactly what it would be
[02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:58.520]   Oh, like 180 240. Yeah, exactly. You're not diabetic. You're just testing this out, right?
[02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:05.480]   I'm doing it because I have poor glucose disposal. So it's just like something that we discover when taking a glucose tolerance test
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:10.520]   So I mean I have to like do extra more more cardio to get in the normal range. I am tight too
[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:13.160]   I mean I control it
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:18.760]   But uh, but are you a metformin user or no? I have a little metformin in my pocket. Yes
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:21.320]   There's some good life extension property. I know
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:25.800]   You know the doctor said your your a1c has been so good you can get off the metformin
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:27.800]   I said but wait, I want to live forever don't it
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:34.280]   Does it have other values and it's pretty harmless, right? It's not it's not a I miss the run forever. Yeah
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:40.520]   And I don't tell any future about feeling expensive, but I yeah, I told I told him uh, no, I want the life extension benefits
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:46.440]   Hey as long as we're on this so he said eat more crispy cream. You can stay on metformin for the rest of your life. Yeah
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:51.320]   Yes, Kevin. Do you do any nor like nor tropics? Do you do any?
[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:54.920]   Like I bet he's microdosing as we speak
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:59.240]   Uh, no actually I don't do a ton. The only thing I do is I have a genetic
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:04.200]   mutation that I found by doing that whole 23 meeting that makes me a bad
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:11.160]   Metholator B vitamins on my homocysteine is high and so I take a special high dose B vitamin did not down the homocysteine
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:13.160]   Which has been linked to um
[02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:19.240]   You know our our plaque and in the arteries. So my dad died of a heart attack. So I got a pace
[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:25.400]   Special was pretty bad. Yeah, he was pretty young. Yeah. Yeah, he was early 70s. So that was a that was a bummer, but for me
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:27.400]   That's pretty young
[02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:32.280]   I I'm very I'm very aware of how close to mid 70s. I'm getting so yeah
[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:37.880]   I'm gonna do I'm gonna send in my genetics to those that company. I've learned a lot
[02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:41.160]   You might have saved my life this week, Kevin. Thank you. I do the sauna
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:46.040]   I do sauna and uh sulfur of fame is also something that I do infrared or what?
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:50.360]   No, actually traditional like like sauna that good for you. I love so
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:53.160]   Also, dude, we we built a sauna
[02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:57.720]   All calls mortality goes down by like 30 percent like steam or dry
[02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:03.480]   You have to get to a certain temperature. I think is what the sweet spots 174 for 20 minutes a day
[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:08.280]   Fahrenheit now before you were doing the cold thing. Have you stopped doing that?
[02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:10.760]   I don't I don't do the cold as much in the winter
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:15.720]   I will just to kind of like harden up a little bit just to kind of like give me it's like nice extra couple
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:19.320]   caffeine in the morning. Yeah, your heart's pounding. Yeah
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:25.480]   But I do the sauna at least I want to I've always wanted a sauna. I love but I like steam
[02:32:25.480 --> 02:32:30.520]   So yeah, that's what I do too. Yeah, I like because I don't want why I just poured over the hot rock
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:33.320]   Yeah, did you build one?
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:36.520]   We have it. Yeah, we built a pretty um
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:40.120]   We built a pretty awesome sauna in our house
[02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:44.920]   It has an automatic shut off. I mean, you're not gonna like fall asleep in there, but
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:50.840]   And for you, it's not an open flame. It's a electric heater or something. It's electric
[02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:55.240]   But it's it's in a enclosed space and it's amazing. I would love that. We also
[02:32:55.240 --> 02:33:02.440]   Um optimized our bed as long as we're just quickly trading some ideas here. Um, so I don't know if I want to know about this
[02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:04.680]   There's this company called ooler
[02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:06.680]   that makes a
[02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:11.000]   fitted blanket with conduit running through it and uh in it on
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.880]   So it's cooler without the sea is it? Yeah, it's a bed cooling
[02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:20.280]   Yeah, now I will say if anybody listening to this is anywhere near this company
[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:26.440]   You need to fix your janky ass app, uh and the bluetooth connectivity, which is so hugely problematic
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:33.800]   But um, I sleep at 60 degrees every night and then you're supposed to see it's better for you to sleep cool, right?
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:37.160]   Yeah, right well it regulates my body temperature for me at night
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:42.120]   And then I have it set at around five o'clock to start because I like to wake up early warm. Yep
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.280]   Um, so it it goes up to about 115 degrees. I don't think Lisa's go except this
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:52.440]   Should we actually aim electric blanket because she gets so cold. I don't know if I should get and I wait to blanket on top of me
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:53.480]   Yeah
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:58.040]   I had that ooler as well and I love doing my god, but the app right?
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:04.200]   We'll say that no well sleep eight is better. It's just better app better tech is less like eight
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:08.600]   Yeah, yeah, great. Okay. It's it's basically like you know when you lean on the ooler
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:11.480]   It still feels like you're kind of like laying on something because there is those courses
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:16.200]   I'm going underneath you sleep late super cozy and it does all the same things better technology
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:20.200]   It looks like your HRV and everything and adjust things dynamically. Do you want it to?
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:24.040]   How do you spell sleep eight because I found uh, or maybe eight sleep?
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:26.760]   Maybe they do the other way around but they have they have one that yeah
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:28.400]   It's a it's a hygien
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:34.120]   Ht eight sleep calm. I like our mattress. We've got like a I have a cast
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:37.960]   They have one that zips on top of of your existing mattress so you can do it without the
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:42.200]   Without buying a whole new mattress. That's what I got. That's what I want to have to buy a whole new mattress
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:46.120]   I mean, so there's it's interesting like there's a whole bunch of sleep tech
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:50.280]   Trying to optimize your sleep and you're sort of unconscious
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:53.080]   You know, you're you're letting somebody else take care of you while while you're asleep
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:57.800]   But I will say between the my husband has the a conduit
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:05.240]   Weighted blanket and I just have the way to blanket so we now but but I'm sleeping better than I've probably ever slept
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:10.440]   Sleeping cool is body temperature regulated. I'm not gonna that people who are watching and listening
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:17.080]   Are now saying next thing leo's gonna tell him he tapes his mouth shut. So I'm not gonna mention that
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:22.200]   I've done that but I have been doing that after reading james nesters brit breath
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:24.920]   Yes, great book great book
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:27.480]   with what kind of tape
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:29.720]   Oh, now you got me started on amazon
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:32.600]   It's three micro pore surgical tape. You don't lose
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:39.480]   Post a bad latex allergy. No latex. I don't think and you you don't uh, you don't just a postage stamp
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:42.040]   if you had to because
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:45.480]   Sometimes I have to sneeze and there's nowhere to
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:48.920]   So you don't want to tape the whole thing
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:51.640]   This way you go
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.640]   at the side, but
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:56.120]   All right enough for that
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:58.120]   And a humidifier
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:01.320]   Have a humidifier. Okay. Yeah, I mean this way
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:05.560]   Is very deep rabbit hole. Oh, yeah, I've got our bedroom is
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:12.440]   Is very high-tech for a good night's sleep is perhaps one of man's most worthy
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:14.760]   causes
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:20.840]   Because I mean especially as you get older. I don't I don't sleep well at all and if I could have a good night's sleep
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:24.120]   Just once I would love that
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:26.840]   I
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.880]   Weighted blanket weighted blanket really that's huge really really you both agree
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:39.080]   So I had to wait a bit extra heavy one. I sleep under a 20 pound weighted blanket now. Nice. Which way did you get?
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:43.480]   It's uh, I forget the name of the brand. It was a little
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:49.320]   It it uses micro beads. So I've had problems with them before where they pool up, you know
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:50.440]   Yes
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:56.600]   Is this like the thundercoat that you put on your dog when there's thunder and because they feel pretty much
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:00.120]   It's the same thing you just basically makes you like all wrapped up in a little baby
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:03.480]   It makes it so you can't flop around
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:10.520]   I'm an active sleeper and I I've had insomnia. I gotta tell you I I don't I fall asleep
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:13.560]   And I don't move at night and I'm just getting more restful sleep now
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:19.400]   This just in from the chat room 3m micro pore surgical tape is a latex-free hypoallergenic
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:22.440]   Paper-based tape and man that stuff sticks
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:26.760]   It is it holding mouth. Well, I don't want to like ruin my beautiful skin
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:31.240]   No, I was worried that I was gonna start I do it every night now. I can't sleep with that
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:37.240]   It's it's it's you know what maybe we're supposed to torture ourselves at sleep at night like do you know
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:43.800]   Maybe I should have somebody come in and spank me because the weighted blanket the tape over the lips the cold
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:48.280]   It's like we spend sleep is sleep is
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:51.080]   extraordinarily important
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:57.880]   It is the moment that is the our cells regenerate like you get like if all the things to optimize in my life
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:00.680]   Like that's the thing that I care most deeply about optimizing. Yeah
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:06.680]   You should have matt walker on new show leo from okay, why we sleep from the he runs the Berkeley sleep lab. Oh, yeah
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:09.720]   He's great. I've heard him. Yes. Yeah, he's great. Yeah
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:12.600]   He knows about all the latest tech on on that stuff
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:15.400]   It'd be a good fun tech guest
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:23.880]   You guys are good fun tech guests kevin rose is such a pleasure his new podcast is modern finance mofai.net
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:28.600]   Highly recommended at kevin rose plug something else. What else
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:32.840]   No, that's it. I mean, I just hope people tune into the podcast. I'm trying to
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.720]   All all the stuff that the problem that I see in fact my own family
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:42.680]   My sister and everyone else is that there's so much going on in the world of decentralized finance and cryptocurrency
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:47.640]   It's confusing. So I just want to like break it down for the average consumer because I think there's going to be
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:51.560]   Uh the entire financial backbone is being rewritten right now
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:54.920]   And it's a really interesting time to invest in that so I want to help people
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:58.360]   Find the right projects to get excited about so that's that's my hope
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:01.880]   Awesome so great to see you kevin

[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.200]   You know before we started the show. I wanted to see some of those research reports and I was reading through them
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:53.320]   They're awesome number one and number two. I expected to hit a paywall. I like clicked on one. I'm like, okay
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:59.000]   My one of them actually the report just comes up. It's awesome. It's like all free. Thank you. She gives it away folks
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.560]   14 years in a row
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:04.840]   Yeah, um, I had it pointed out to me that if we charged
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:10.600]   $1 per download that we would have several million extra dollars a new a year as a company
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:15.640]   It's always fair. It dollars fair. But uh, I don't know I I can't
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:20.920]   I can't continue to say that I'm I'm i'm a futurist because i'm trying to make this i'm trying to
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:26.120]   Leave a positive dent on the world. Um, and then charge people a bunch of money
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:31.560]   Uh to get the research that I think would take them there. So you're not freaking just basis. Yeah
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:34.680]   Right scroll up a little bit right there that blockchain was the one I checked out
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:37.960]   It's actually it's really good. There we go in FinTech that report right there
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:40.120]   recommended
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:43.880]   By FinTech expert Kevin Rose. No, I mean, I was I was shocked
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:48.520]   Like the lot of the stuff that we I mean I have analysts that work at Revengers that that go into this stuff
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.240]   And we were always looking at the new projects and you you hit on a lot of it. I was a report published. Is that soon?
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:57.480]   Uh, it launches every year at south by so it launched officially on
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:03.880]   March 16th. Yeah, okay. Awesome. How was south by Amy? Did you was there anything? How did it?
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:10.680]   It happened. Listen, I gotta tell you um, and I'll keep a brief, but I my heart goes out to them. They
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:12.680]   Uh, they
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:17.160]   They weren't a rough spot. I'm sure they didn't have yeah, they didn't have the right insurance last year
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:22.600]   So they they couldn't make a lot of adjustments. I think this year they did about as good as job
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.480]   Good as as good a job
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:30.840]   Um as as you could have hoped and hue forest and and sirlin and and that whole crew
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:38.600]   That put together the content. I really think they did. I really think they did a good job. A good job. So awesome. Yeah, I'm glad to hear it
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:41.320]   Next year. Let's all meet
