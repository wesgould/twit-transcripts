[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.560]   Don't do it.

[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.920]   The show that covers the week's Tech News
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.800]   in a very kind of special show today.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   We welcome of course Christina Warren, film girl,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.280]   always great to have her from Mashable,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.440]   joining us from the East Coast.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.880]   Larry Maggid of CBS Radio and his brand new studio,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520]   joining us from the West Coast.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.320]   Nice to have you, Larry.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240]   But we've got two veterans of science fiction,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.400]   one of the two of the greatest writers I know.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.040]   Jerry Pournell of course has been on Twit many times,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.880]   who talked about Jerry's books.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.320]   And of course, my career was inspired by Jerry's column,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.600]   Chaos Manor in Bite Magazine for many years.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720]   Chaos Manor is back, we're gonna talk about that.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.960]   But Jerry is not in his usual den
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   with the wall to wall books.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.400]   You're somewhere else, Jerry,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.440]   where are you today?
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.400]   I'm in Larry Niven's office.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.200]   Larry Niven.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.040]   Can you hear me?
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.440]   I hear you and I love, I'm a.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.320]   Yes, Larry Niven.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.920]   Boy, I would love to meet Larry Niven.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.680]   He of course, your co-author for Lucifer's Hammer,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.960]   so many great books,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.680]   and the creator of the Ringworld series and so forth.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.640]   It'd be so fun.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.560]   One of these days you have to bring him on the show
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.400]   with you, will ya?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.200]   He's not gonna be quiet.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.240]   (laughs)
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.040]   John, there he is, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.160]   it's so nice to meet you, Larry Niven, such a fan,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.320]   and so glad that you and Jerry continue to collaborate.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.120]   I didn't realize you were still working on books together.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.360]   We love collaborating.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.240]   We go, it's how we get our hiking in.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.480]   Talk story during a hike.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.320]   Really?
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.720]   I'm better than what we used to do, which was drink.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.680]   (laughs)
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.160]   Oh, you've got healthy on us.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.040]   That's kinda cool, so you'll, in fact,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.880]   a lot of people in Silicon Valley do this.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.760]   Steve Jobs very famously would take job prospects
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.840]   on a hike with him.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.280]   Mark Zuckerberg now does something similar.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.440]   I think the mind, the blood is going,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   the mind's working, and I think there's also,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   I read somewhere a law that if you're distracted
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.240]   by something, your subconscious can work more effectively,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.880]   and it's a more creative, you have more creative,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.280]   that's why you have great ideas in the shower.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   Yes, hiking works, and Jerry's series
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.680]   that we're getting more blood to the brain.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   Absolutely, and until you start showering together,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.920]   probably the best way to collaborate.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.480]   Yeah, we haven't done that.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.320]   So what are you--
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.000]   Probably not, not in the cards.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.840]   What are you guys--
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.400]   We're here at Sonna though.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.760]   Sonna, a very good place to come up with great ideas.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.680]   Yeah, Larry has a sonna.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.080]   I love sonnas, I'm a fan.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.240]   So are you still in California, guys?
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.600]   Or what state are you in?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.120]   We're in California, in Chatsworth, California.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.960]   Chatsworth?
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.800]   No.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.360]   It's the northwest corner of Los Angeles County.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.560]   So you're not far from home, Jerry?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.600]   No, about--
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.680]   You want to do some art?
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.240]   All right.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   So--
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.240]   It used to be a little closer.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.400]   He used to be in Tarzana, which was a very appropriate place
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.200]   for a science fiction writer to be from, but--
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.080]   Wait a minute, is Tarzana named after Tarzana?
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   No.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.920]   The Apes, yes.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.560]   Edgar Rice Burrows, who was also a science fiction
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.800]   could fabulous as well.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.360]   The Burrows family owned most of the land,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.880]   and they developed it, so--
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.720]   Had no idea.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.320]   With the proceeds from the Tarzana books?
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.840]   Yes.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.640]   And the related science fiction, he
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.000]   was the king of science fiction in the state.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.160]   Yes, he was, I know.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.200]   And there is a display of Tarzan memorabilia
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.040]   in the Tarzana Post Office.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.880]   I had no idea.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.760]   I think you should have a town called Luca Fajama.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   I fear not.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.960]   Not quite so much.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.880]   Hey, what are you guys--
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.080]   Jerry kind of alluded to the fact
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.800]   that you are working on something new together.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.360]   What are you working on?
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.960]   Let me start with a conversation that
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.640]   happened during a hike.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.160]   We were hiking with E.E. King, whom you haven't met.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   And Stephen Barnes, I don't know.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   And Jerry and me, we were hiking,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.560]   and the subject of Luca Fajama came up.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.360]   And I presently admitted that I had always known
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.960]   how to save the surfer.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.040]   Gil the surfer, and I have seen quotes
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.400]   that you say you wish you had saved him.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.080]   If you've seen that, I'm not sure where they came from.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   OK.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.960]   Because they demanded I save him.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.000]   Right, the story is saving him.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.240]   And I kind of waffled and thought about it for a while.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   And I decided I didn't want to save him.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.040]   Really?
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.760]   So what I've written is a ghost story.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.880]   So just for people who haven't read--
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.400]   and you should read Luca Fajama, a giant comet,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.120]   hits planet Earth that causes a huge tidal wave.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.480]   The surfer decides if he's going to go,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   he's going to go with a bang and tries to ride the tidal wave,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.320]   which were to work fine, had an apartment building not
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.920]   intervened.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.600]   Am I correct?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.680]   Is that an accurate sense?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.040]   That's a good succinct description of it, accurate,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.520]   in every respect.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.240]   Let me set a piece of stage here.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.680]   You understand that on a collaboration,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   we each do about 90% of the world.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.400]   But the surfer's all his.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.560]   I couldn't have had dreamed that up in a million years.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.920]   So Nature Magazine, a few years ago,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.080]   had a 30th anniversary of Lucifer--
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.760]   Oh.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.000]   Oh, we hear Jerry talking off Mike.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   We got to get Jerry back because his--
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.440]   Larry, his Skype just dropped out.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.640]   You're still there.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.200]   Go slap the back of his head.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   You're not.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   Come on, go sit next to Larry, Jerry.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.560]   Alex!
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.880]   Jerry's son Alex, who is really a good IT guy, both Larry
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.480]   Maggot and I know him from all those trade shows
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.280]   that he does the IT for, including showstoppers.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.960]   Not yet.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.440]   We're working on it.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   No.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.200]   I don't see it.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.640]   Jerry, he's hearing your voice.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.040]   Well, I'm hearing him from a distance.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.800]   I'm hearing him through your mic, Larry.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.520]   His screen is showing something else.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.600]   His Skype is down.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.280]   We only hear him because we hear him through your mic.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.440]   Look, can you hear me?
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.280]   Yeah, through your--
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.120]   Far away!
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.040]   You're hearing Jerry through my mic?
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.440]   Yeah, that's why we can hear him.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   He's going here.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.880]   He's going here.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.840]   I have him sitting on the mic.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.360]   If you guys call it together, you can
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.760]   sit and share a studio.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.480]   Here we go.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.000]   There we go.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.280]   You got him.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.800]   Yeah, OK.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.960]   Back to the story.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.720]   Set the stage.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.400]   OK.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.360]   So anyway, Nature Magazine runs this review of Lucifer's Hammer
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.720]   on the 40th anniversary of it or something of the sword.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   So we did a lot of science and technology in that story, right?
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.280]   So what is the first page of Nature Magazine, which
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.000]   is the world physics magazine?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.400]   What does it-- well, of course it has the surfer scene.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.640]   So everybody remembers the surfer if they
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.720]   don't remember another thing in the story.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.440]   So now you know who I live in and I work together.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.000]   I do the plots and he does the stuff people remember.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.200]   I love it.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.680]   Yeah, what we're going to say.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.480]   It is very memorable for some reason.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.520]   You know what I remember most from Lucifer's Hammer?
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.000]   And I think I've mentioned this to you before, Jerry,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.240]   is that when the infrastructure of the world is destroyed,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.640]   as it is by this comet, it turns out
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.200]   that everybody has been using technology,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.160]   but nobody knows how to remake it.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.640]   It's almost, for us, magical.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.760]   And it really reminds me of the world we live in today,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.680]   where we may be using iPads and computers and smartphones,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.280]   but could we recreate it if something should happen?
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.000]   Probably not.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.240]   Well, yes and no.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.520]   That actually, the story Larry wrote, which maybe a ghost story
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.320]   and maybe real, has a good bit of some of the aftermath
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.560]   to it as to what's happening.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.400]   It's certainly true that most of the people in this world,
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.520]   except fruits of technology in about the same way
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.120]   as a kitten accepts milk when you pour it into a bowl for it
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.880]   and are about as capable of recreating it as a kitten would be.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.920]   But there are still some people who can do it.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.800]   You remember these for a summer?
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.960]   We did preserve the knowledge of how to do a lot of that.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   Much of it preserved as books wrapped in ziplock bags
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.560]   and thrown into a septic tank to hide them.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.800]   Right.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.080]   By a good pile of wizard, we turned one of our friends
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.480]   into a wizard.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.560]   Well, I'm really glad to hear that there's more coming.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.240]   When are we going to see this and where?
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.480]   It's my turn.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.800]   And I guess I'll need to get--
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.640]   it's been playing with my new toy.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.840]   You were talking about the Wall Street Journal.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.360]   I had it on your screen here a minute ago.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.160]   What is that?
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.480]   This is a session, or I'm sorry, a surface.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.600]   Oh, you got the Surface Pro 3, the new Microsoft Surface.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.480]   I have a Surface Pro 3, and I'm just
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.920]   getting to learn about it, so I'm not going to say too much now.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.400]   But I love it.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.640]   Larry, are you-- Larry Niven, are you as much of a geek
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.440]   as Jerry is?
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.240]   Oh, I'm not.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.040]   I don't have the nerve for it, as I say,
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.960]   as I was telling you earlier.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   I have a perfectly good low heartbeat--
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.760]   sorry-- perfectly good low blood pressure,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.800]   because I don't try to solve machines the way Jerry does.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.040]   It will put you--
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.760]   watched him for years.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.640]   He always goes nuts.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.800]   He goes into a flurry of confusion,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.560]   and gradually works his way out of it much more easily
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.080]   and much further than I could.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.560]   Which is why I read Chaos Man, or each and every month,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.080]   in Bite Magazine.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.800]   You said, Larry, I mean, Jerry, that's kind of coming back.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.840]   What's the latest with Chaos Man?
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.960]   When I learned this machine a little better,
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.000]   there's my Wall Street Journal.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.960]   When I get a little more used to this,
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.400]   I'm calling it the Precious, as in, oh, my Precious.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.480]   It-- I will be doing so within a month.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.240]   Good.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.560]   Then I'll--
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.400]   No, we lost any more.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.520]   And I hope he can figure out how to use Skype before--
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.400]   No, it's because we're sharing Skype with Larry Niven
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.040]   and Jerry Pournell.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.600]   And unfortunately, Alex Scott, you're
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.920]   is working better, Larry, than he got Jerry's working.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.240]   Larry, what are you used to right with?
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.200]   It was agony.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.160]   I watched the agony.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.000]   It is agony.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And you see your blood pressure's already going up.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.560]   Kick out-- kick Jerry right out right now, if I were you.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.000]   Oh, and Christina's gone.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.080]   The whole thing's fallen apart.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   The wheels--
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.840]   The wheels are falling off the show.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.480]   Larry Niven, what are you-- you do write on a computer,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.960]   at least, right?
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   Yes, I do.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.800]   Jerry Pournell and a guy named Tony Peach
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.200]   worked up a computer for use by writers.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.600]   And when he had it perfected, he made me duplicated.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.160]   And I duplicated it twice because those were the days
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.880]   when you needed spare parts.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.440]   What do you use Microsoft Word?
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.840]   What do you write in?
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.840]   Microsoft Word didn't exist then.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.040]   Yes, I use Microsoft Word today.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.120]   For some reason, I imagine both you and Jerry
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.160]   using some ancient--
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.400]   you know, PFS write or something, some ancient technology.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.760]   Jerry keeps up.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.280]   Yeah, he keeps up.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.560]   But a lot of writers I know don't want
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.680]   to think about the technology.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.240]   They want it to get out of the way.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.400]   They just want to write.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.120]   Who was it?
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.600]   George RR Martin uses WordStar.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.000]   This is the doc days.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.880]   This is a wizard of chaos manner you're talking about.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   Jerry has to keep up even when a science fiction writer doesn't.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.960]   It's so true.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.200]   Hey, Larry Niven, I want to thank you so much for being here.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.360]   I look forward to finding out what happens to Gil the Surfer,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.400]   a ghost story.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.000]   And just-- but you know, a kick Jerry in the butt,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.080]   because apparently Jerry's just falling down on the job
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.640]   these days.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.240]   It'll be a bigger story by the time Jerry gets into it.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.120]   Is he the--
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.160]   why do you think it's going elsewhere in the world?
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.520]   Is he the--
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520]   following Lucifer's hammer?
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.320]   Is he the wordy one?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.160]   Yeah, Jerry's the wordy one.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.080]   Yes.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.680]   I work angles, Leo.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.600]   Larry has told a perfectly good story.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.000]   It would be publishable now.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.720]   But when I'm finished with it, it
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.320]   will be probably half again, maybe twice as long.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.760]   And it will have some subplots in it that are not
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.560]   in what he has done.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.320]   And I make them all come together.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.880]   And then he goes over it and finds some scene
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   that everybody will remember.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.240]   And they'll forget that I ever had any heart in it.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.600]   What the hell?
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.040]   Jerry's a filagrist.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.480]   He just adds a little Baroque detail to the smell.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.920]   Well, I'm the filagrist.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.160]   Well, that's close.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.720]   And I'm the mad one.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.320]   Jerry's entirely happy with the notion that I'm the mad one.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.240]   Well, you'll have to--
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.160]   He's saying he does the sanity.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.320]   You'll have to forgive me for being a little fan boy here.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.560]   But I am so thrilled to get to talk to you.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.760]   Jerry, of course, an inspiration for my career.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.280]   But I love the stuff you do together
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   and Larry and Evan's Ringworld and all the stuff
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.600]   you've done on your own too is just some of the best science
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.240]   fiction ever written.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.160]   And a must read for anybody who hasn't yet.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.600]   Just start with Ringworld and work your way through that
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.320]   by itself.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.440]   Then start with Lucifer's hammer, the Moten God's eye.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.840]   Jerry's even done some young adult stuff, I know,
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.320]   with this theme.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.440]   There's a lot of great stuff to read.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.880]   And Roberta, right?
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.920]   It's some short stories.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.480]   Is Roberta writing too?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.440]   Which your daughter's writing, right?
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.840]   My daughter, Jennifer, has written a sequel to "Moke" yes.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.960]   So it's a family thing.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.680]   I'm telling you, we're working on "Moteville, USA."
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   If Edgar Rice-Bros could have it, you can too.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.480]   Thank you so much, Larry and Evan.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.640]   We're going to let you go because we're
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.120]   going to get very boring right now as we talk about tech news.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.160]   OK, have fun.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160]   Take care.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.120]   Nice to meet you, Larry.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.920]   More outies.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.600]   Boy, it's just so fun.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.200]   One of the great science fiction writers.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   Jerry, thank you for bringing Larry out.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.280]   I've always wanted to get the two of you together.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.920]   You know what I'd like to do down the road is maybe do an hour
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.640]   with the two of you.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.880]   If we could work that out, I'd like to do that.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.480]   Let's take a break.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.360]   When we come back, we've got some big stories to talk about.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.200]   I guess just came out the final word
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.880]   that YouTube has purchased Twitch.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.160]   This was rumored for months.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   Twitch.tv for $1 billion.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.400]   We'll talk about that in a whole lot more coming up.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.000]   With Film Girl, Christina Warren from Mashable, Larry
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.640]   Maggot from CBS.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.080]   Thank you.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:12.680]   That was fun.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.200]   Jerry Pranella.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.720]   It was fun.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.000]   Thank you, Larry.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.600]   We appreciate it.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.080]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Stamps.com.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.840]   Why go to the post office?
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.680]   If you're mailing stuff for your business,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.480]   you want to do a great job on fulfillment.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.320]   Stamps.com gives you all the power
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.920]   of a professional mailing house at your desk.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.680]   Better than the post office.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.280]   Your computer, your printer, you don't need a special inks.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.920]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.320]   You just need Stamps.com.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.560]   And most of all, you don't need to be a tech expert.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.720]   So if you're selling on Etsy or eBay or Amazon,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.120]   if you're a business where you send out mailers or invoices,
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.360]   why go to the post office?
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.320]   Buy Stamps, put them on-- it's not professional looking.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.880]   With Stamps.com, you can print right on the envelope.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.720]   Your logo, the return address, is automatically there.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.680]   You could pull the senders, the recipient's address,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.040]   from your QuickBooks, from your website.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.160]   It just makes it easy.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.960]   Plus, you'll get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.080]   If you're sending an Express mail or a Priority mail,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.480]   you get discounts.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480]   Plus, they'll send out the email for you automatically,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   the confirmation email, return receipt.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.080]   They do international customs forms automatically.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.720]   Automatic address verification.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.120]   It really is a great way to do it.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.560]   Even discounted package insurance, all in one click.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.160]   And you know the best part is, the mail carrier comes
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   to your house, picks it up, takes it away.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.720]   That's it.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.960]   You're done.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.320]   There's even a big button on the Stamps.com site that says,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.160]   bring that carrier out back out of here again.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.120]   I want them again.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.040]   Post office loves Stamps.com.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.320]   They're a perfect partner.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.960]   You will too.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.120]   And that's why I want you to try it right now with our Noors
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.800]   trial.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.080]   It's a $110 bonus offer.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.960]   If you go to Stamps.com, click the microphone
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.920]   in the upper right hand corner.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.240]   And you'll get a digital scale, $55 in free postage.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.640]   You'll get a $5 supplies kit and a four week trial of Stamps.com.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   This is a great offer.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.760]   So go to Stamps.com before you do anything else.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.400]   Click the microphone at the top of the home page.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.080]   Type into it.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.560]   If you are doing mailing for your business,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.840]   you really need to know about Stamps.com.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.680]   And it's so funny because I get a lot of packages.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.160]   Every day I get packages.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.200]   And I can always tell if it's a professional outfit
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.760]   or if there's 18 stamps on there, I know the difference.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.080]   Let's see.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.760]   This was a week for quarterly profits.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:40.520]   This is sometimes the least interesting news of the year.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.720]   How Apple did, how Microsoft did.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.520]   Apple sold 35.2 million iPhones in its third quarter.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.880]   It's the slowest quarter.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.360]   They had revenue of $37 billion, not so bad.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.840]   Anything to deduce from this or is it just kind of--
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.400]   we were hoping that Tim Cook or the new CFO
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.680]   would leak something about it at expectations on an iWatch
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.240]   or an iPhone.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.880]   Larry, did you listen to the conference call?
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.640]   Did they say anything?
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.840]   No, no.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.880]   We can't have anything that Apple is going to do.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.400]   I mean, although nothing to contradict what's in the rumor
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.680]   mill either in terms of the iPhone 6 or some of the wearables.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.000]   The most interesting news I think
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.440]   is that iPad sales are down for what the--
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.360]   Second, that's at least the second row.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.600]   And that doesn't really surprise me.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.360]   I actually predicted at the very beginning
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.640]   that as much as I admired Steve Jobs,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.360]   I do not think that they were the end of the PC.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.800]   They were simply another type of PC
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.360]   that people use along with other devices.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.880]   But as somebody pointed out today, the other problem
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.360]   was iPads is they don't break.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.200]   And they don't--
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.120]   Everybody's got one.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.640]   Proof.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.800]   I've got one if it's two or three years old, so what?
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.000]   It still does exactly what it's supposed to do.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.480]   And is it really worth going out and spending hundreds of dollars
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.720]   more for when it's just slightly lighter than the one
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.560]   that was pretty light to begin with?
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.040]   So it may be that they just don't have any replacement
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.080]   market among the enthusiasts.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   There's a problem, of course, there's
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.400]   plenty of Android tablets where I'm very picky about my phone.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.720]   I'm not all picky about what tablet I use,
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.880]   because what I do want it, they all seem to work just fine.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.040]   And frankly, I don't use tablets very often.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.640]   I know there are other people who use it much more frequently
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.120]   than I do.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.080]   But I think it's not necessarily such a big deal.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.400]   But because that was, to me, the news-- and the other news
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.080]   is that Macs are doing very well.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.880]   That despite the supposed posted personal computer era,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.360]   Apple's personal computer business
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.520]   is thriving, as it deserves to, because they've
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.720]   got some great products out there.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.880]   They sold 13.3 million iPhones.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.360]   That's down 9% from this time last year.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.600]   I'm looking for the Mac sales.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.480]   They were like 4.48, I think.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.760]   They were up.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.600]   And you're up.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.640]   But still a fraction of the iPad sales.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.200]   Yes.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.840]   And would you buy-- I wouldn't buy an iPhone.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.960]   To be honest with you, I wouldn't buy any phone right now
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.280]   until the iPhone 6 comes out.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.000]   I want to see what it looks like.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.200]   And I'm telling people, if you can wait till the 6 comes out,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.320]   whether you're an Android person or an iPhone person,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.240]   it doesn't matter.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.360]   See what Apple's coming out with, and then make your buying
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:12.840]   decision.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.560]   And maybe you'll buy an Android phone.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.360]   But why would somebody buy an iPhone 5 as an iPhone 5?
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   Well, in fact, isn't that what Apple--
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.080]   the one kind of personal bit that came through in this call
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.000]   was the moaning and groaning that rumors
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.680]   have depressed iPhone sales.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.520]   Yeah, well, they were still up.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.040]   I mean, they were 35.6 million iPhones.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.120]   That's really high, especially for their slowest quarter.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.280]   iPads were soft, and they were down year over year.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.080]   But iPhones were actually up.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.560]   And they were up in a lot of their international markets,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.040]   which are likely less sensitive about the new release.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.160]   So I think that the new releases are mostly
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.240]   where they're saturated.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.840]   So like the United States, Western Europe, whereas other markets,
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.000]   it's just about more about getting the first iPhone
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   versus replacing to the latest greatest.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.120]   But yeah, I mean, iPad sales were definitely down.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.680]   But the iPhone did really well on the Mac sales.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.560]   Not only-- I mean, there's still a fraction of iPhone
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.280]   and a iPad.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.600]   But when you compare Mac sales to the PC market at large,
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.880]   they are, I think, up 14%, whereas the overall market
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.280]   is down 20%.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.080]   So it's a really interesting dichotomy right there.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.000]   Can we deduce anything from the fact that iPod sales down 36%?
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   iPad sales down 9%.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.640]   Mac sales up, iPhone sales up.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.600]   Does this-- is there a trend that you can say, well,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.200]   people are-- if they're going to get a computer nowadays,
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.840]   they're going to get a big computer.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.560]   But most people are just buying phones.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.160]   It seems to me-- we're not only in the post-PC world.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.800]   I've said this before.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.360]   We're in the post-tablet world.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.080]   The phone is becoming-- this is becoming the device of choice.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.840]   Well, we're right.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.800]   Well, I think--
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   Exactly.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.280]   Go ahead, Christian.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:49.840]   You say it.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.520]   No, sorry.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.360]   No, what I was going to say was-- no, I went with you.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.160]   I think that maybe the mistake a lot of us made--
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.760]   and I would include myself in this-- is seeing the iPad
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.840]   as the ultimate post-PC replacement when that's not really
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.080]   true.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.520]   It might be in some situations, maybe education,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.200]   maybe for certain business scenarios.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.120]   But the real replacement for the computer, especially
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.760]   in the emerging world and the developing world,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.880]   is going to be the phone.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.600]   So this is what you're going to sell more of time over time
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.040]   rather than the tablet.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.400]   And to your point from earlier, the life
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.160]   cycle of tablets has been incredibly long.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.760]   But it is interesting, because I was actually
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.200]   writing something this week about how I'm not ready to call
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.520]   tablets the new networks yet.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.680]   I think that we misjudged the market that I don't think it's
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.240]   dead.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.800]   But tablet sales, at least in North America,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.840]   are down across the board.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.000]   So it's not just Apple sales.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.080]   They're down worldwide.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.040]   They're actually expecting only 11% growth for the year
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.280]   compared with something like 50% growth last year.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.080]   So I think that as kind of a boom item,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   if anybody thought it was going to be the next smartphone,
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.520]   they were wrong.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.800]   But how long they last and how they'll
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.000]   merge with current PCs, I think, remains to be seen.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.960]   But definitely, I think this is going to be the future
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.920]   computer for sure.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.680]   Jerry, I know you love your iPad.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.880]   But I notice you've got a Surface.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.040]   Do you feel like that Surface Pro is a tablet, a PC, a laptop,
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.160]   or both?
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.640]   It may be all of them.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.680]   One of the things that nobody seemed to be considering,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.200]   you know, is that--
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   have you seen the Samsung and the other ones,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.480]   the big phones that are bad?
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.360]   I have a note three.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.200]   The note four is coming out.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.680]   The tablet.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.240]   The rumor-- and I don't buy it,
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.280]   but the rumor is that Apple will do a 5 and 1/2 inch iPhone.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.160]   That's pretty--
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.360]   we call those tablets.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.280]   I mean, do you think, Christina, they're
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.840]   going to do a 5 and 1/2 inch?
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.280]   No.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.960]   No, I think it's bogus.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   I think it's totally bogus.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.600]   And I think that what's even more bogus
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.640]   is the rumor that they're going to have two launches.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   That is insane.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   Anybody who's saying, oh, they're going to release one,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.800]   and then a few months later, they're going to release another.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   It's like, no.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.000]   They don't do that.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.200]   No, they don't do that.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.400]   And no matter what has changed with Tim Cook
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.560]   and I think a lot of the changes have been good,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.960]   that's the fundamental part of Apple,
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.520]   is that they keep it very simple.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.720]   They're not going to release a bigger phone.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.760]   They're not going to have a 3 and 1/2 inch, a 4 inch,
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.920]   a 4.7 inch, and a 5.5 inch.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.680]   Like, that's just-- that's not Apple.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.560]   By the way, is that Louise from Bob's Burgers on your--
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.160]   Yes, it is.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.960]   Yes, yes.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.800]   You are weird.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.360]   I was from Halloween.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.000]   She's my favorite cartoon character on your favorite show.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.560]   I got ears from Etsy.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.720]   I was Louise for Halloween.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.040]   It was the best.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.280]   And I was so excited.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.240]   A number of people recognized it on the street, which was awesome.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.200]   But Bob's Burgers retweeted me.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.000]   I love it.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.760]   Really?
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.280]   Wow.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.400]   You are-- let me show just folks, because you're really kind of--
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.200]   that's your doppelganger, actually.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.760]   Totally, totally.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.960]   So you're not going to get revenge today?
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.200]   No, Louise, I'm not.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.760]   OK, got it.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.840]   Then I won't--
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.480]   I think it is, Christina Warren.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.320]   Is that you?
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:53.840]   It's just a star.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.640]   In those pink ears.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.800]   You put my credit card.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.680]   Until I'm in just a star.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.520]   Timbarrine.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.000]   Timbarrine.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.040]   All right, but your smartphone is cool.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.480]   I would be not a smartphone.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.280]   And how can you be?
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.560]   But can it do this?
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.480]   That's what I want to know.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.160]   Look at my-- well, wait a minute.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.120]   It's not doing it anymore.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.880]   Can it do this?
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.880]   Ooh.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.480]   You got the Amazon.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.520]   This is the fire phone that no one wants, no one should buy.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.240]   But that's cool.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   Leo, it's worth 200 bucks for that alone.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.800]   Try 600, 700 bucks.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.720]   Oh, you bought it outright, yeah.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.840]   Well, yeah, because I--
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.480]   it's never 200 bucks.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.640]   You know that, Larry Maggot.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.120]   It's 200 bucks for--
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.240]   and two years forever.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.840]   Slave labor.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.640]   Slave labor.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.680]   This is my latest phone.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.240]   This is the new LG G3.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.240]   Oh, you have the G3.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.680]   You have the-- you know, it's a--
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.480]   back to Christina's point, I wouldn't go out of my way
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   to read a book or watch a movie on this.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.760]   But the reality is that most of the time when I want to read
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.320]   a book or watch a movie, it's when I have it in my pocket.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.120]   Hold that up again.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.200]   That looks like a tablet.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.720]   That's five and a half inches.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.680]   Yeah, it's big.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.080]   But it's big.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.040]   You know, it fits in my hand.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:57.720]   It fits in my pocket.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.240]   Is it-- wait a minute.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.400]   Pull it back from the cameras just because it's so close.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.160]   No, it's really that huge.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.480]   No, it's bigger than your head, Larry.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   Carrot 2, I don't know.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.000]   What have I got?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.440]   Well, here is--
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440]   Wow.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.920]   Now, the G3 is the first ultra HD screen, which means it's not
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.120]   1080p.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.080]   It's what is it?
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.680]   2560 by 1440.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.440]   It's--
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:17.940]   Yes.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.440]   Really good.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.960]   And also--
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.040]   It's 27 to shine back.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.320]   It's insane.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.160]   What is the dots per inch on that five and a half?
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.680]   It's like 450, 500?
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.960]   I think it's 553.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.160]   553.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.200]   See, I don't think you can see anything over 350 or 400,
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.560]   right?
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.920]   I mean, even if it's this close.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.120]   You know, my take on the screen is--
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.640]   it's great, but I'll fill it.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.800]   Is it greater than, say, the M8 or this S5?
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.320]   They're all practical purposes.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:47.960]   They're all fine.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.000]   They're all the same.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.040]   I wouldn't buy a phone based on display ticks.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.920]   To me, I'd buy a phone based on battery life.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.480]   And this phone has good battery life.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:55.980]   It does.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.840]   And it's removable, right?
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.400]   So you get a second--
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:57.880]   Removable.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.920]   So that I'd buy it for that reason.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.160]   But I wouldn't buy it for the screen at all,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.000]   even though it's a great screen.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.880]   So Christina, you have a four-inch phone.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.380]   I do.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.440]   Larry Maggots using a 5 and 1/2 inch phone.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.040]   You might think that it's going to fit in a--
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.160]   This is a 4.7, which I actually-- this
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.040]   is going to be the new iPhone.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.520]   It's going to be the same size as the Fire.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.000]   That's the perfect size.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.600]   I think so.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.960]   The Moto X is 4.7.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.080]   Every time I use a 4.7, I feel like that's the right.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.040]   That's how it should be.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.880]   Just to complete the thought on the Fire Phone,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.000]   I realize now having used it that--
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.120]   there's neat stuff in it.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.640]   There's that dynamic perspective, which gives it a 3D look.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.880]   There's the Firefly button.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.400]   If you press and hold the dedicated camera button,
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.320]   little fireflies show up, and then you take a picture of something,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.760]   and you could buy it on Amazon.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.240]   Or if it's a work of art, it'll identify it and stuff like that.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.480]   It's got the May Day button.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.440]   So that means you can get help by pressing a button in a video.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.320]   A person will show up in video.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.200]   But what I realized is that, really, Amazon
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.360]   has gone wrong on this phone.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.960]   By forking Android and making their own operating system,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.560]   even though they're doing some innovative stuff
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.360]   like this is really annoying when you--
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.200]   so here's a game, cool game.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.640]   But half the screen is wasted on recommendations
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.800]   for other things to buy.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.040]   That is annoying.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.840]   When it's mail, it shows me other mail.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.440]   But when it's a game or apps that
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.000]   don't have any obvious additional information,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.520]   it shows me it's an ad.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.200]   That sucks.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.560]   Here's my audiobooks, and then there shows me an ad
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.480]   for other audiobooks that I haven't purchased.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.240]   To me, if this had been a true Android phone
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.520]   with a kind of vanilla Android, then I might say, hey,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.080]   this is a phone to consider, because of the Amazon special.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.400]   And you pay full price for it.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.480]   They don't even give you a price break in exchange
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.000]   for the fact that it's a selling machine, a buying machine.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.160]   They do give you one break, and they
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.280]   sense they give you a year with a prime, which
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.640]   is worth $100.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.200]   So you've got to give them credit for that.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.640]   But other than that, it's the same price
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.920]   as any other high-end phone.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.160]   And it's the same specs.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.400]   Most people, wouldn't you think
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.200]   we were going to buy this are already prime users?
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.560]   I mean, if you're going to buy this,
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.960]   part of the big appeal is that you would be the prime--
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   The ad year.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.320]   So it's like 100% of the way.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.320]   That's good.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.720]   I had higher hopes.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.280]   And you know, I thought that really, as I think about,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.160]   if they had merely made it a standard Android,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.840]   if they had made it, just make this a KitKat, I think
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.680]   this would be a good phone.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.920]   I would easily be able to recommend this
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.320]   along with a Moto X and similar phones.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.520]   I can't now, because it's hobbled by this unique OS
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:30.960]   that it's doing.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.880]   And there's no Google services, no Google Maps,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.440]   and all those ads.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.800]   And ads.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.280]   You can't even use it with your Fitbit.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:38.880]   Right.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.400]   With the tablet, here's the thing.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.920]   With the tablet, they do this thing
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.120]   where they call recommendations.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.320]   They give you a huge price break on certain Kindle
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.960]   devices in exchange for seeing ads and seeing promotions.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.720]   And they really do give you a great price break.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.120]   I mean, they created readers and tablets
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.640]   that truly are a great value in exchange for looking at ads.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.520]   And I don't mind that, because you're getting something
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.480]   in return.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.200]   But with this, you're paying full price
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.720]   and getting all the ads and getting the selling machine.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.440]   And to me, that bothers me.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.120]   Jerry, you go back to the S100 bus Ezekiel, right?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.760]   And--
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   I go back further than that when we wrote "Mote and God's Eye,"
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.400]   we had pocket computers that are--
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.200]   well, they were sufficiently descriptive
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.600]   that when the iPhones first came out,
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.920]   a couple of my readers got together and bought me one,
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   saying that I had invented it.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.040]   I think you did.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   So we had.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.240]   I think you did.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.480]   But we had in mind something a little bigger than this.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.960]   Mys are not good enough to read a lot on the screen that's
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.000]   small.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.240]   But Alex has one of these Samsung galaxies
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.920]   that takes a scabber to carry it around.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.760]   You can't put a pocket.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.680]   That's a good idea.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.240]   Well, there's a product category.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.680]   Get closer to the size I had in mind.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   I need a smart phone.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.280]   Are you further than me?
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.960]   If I get a shoulder bag that just fits this--
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.120]   The surface.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.120]   You think the surface is--
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.520]   I can see myself using that as a phone, too.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.920]   Really?
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.400]   Yeah, think about it.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.080]   I was sitting on the can the other day in my iPad rang,
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.720]   and I realized that--
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.000]   I'm being a little honest here.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.840]   I'm sorry, Paul.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.960]   It's a TMI camera.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.400]   Overshare.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.240]   But I realized it started ringing,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.920]   and I realized, oh, because I have Google Hangouts,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.240]   and I use Google Voice.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.720]   My iPad is a phone, and I actually answered the phone.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.480]   I won't tell you who was calling, but I answered the phone.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.680]   And I realized, wow, I actually do have a phone on all my devices.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.720]   My computer is phone.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.240]   And that's kind of what I have been thinking
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:57.120]   is that maybe not as big as the surface, but something
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.520]   that's big enough that you can comfortably read books on
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.480]   and with a keyboard that actually works,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.720]   which the surface keyboard does, it isn't as good as the Think
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.320]   Pad's keyboard, but then what is.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:18.160]   But I could honestly see myself using this surface
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.720]   as the only machine.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.960]   Would you ever take the keyboard off and use it as a tablet?
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.000]   Yes.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.520]   Now you will understand it recognizes my handwriting,
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.440]   even if it won't recognize it.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.560]   Is that still the case?
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   OneNote also has a Jerry Pornell recognition engine in it
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.840]   as well?
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.400]   Yes.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.680]   Damn.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.960]   When is that going to die?
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.760]   Never.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.760]   We've told the story on Twitch several times.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.640]   It's a bit of a paragraph as the engine for basically--
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.800]   Oh, it's paragraph?
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.400]   The handwriting recognition engine that Microsoft uses
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.320]   is Stepan Panovich's paragraph for Moscow.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.040]   That's so funny.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.360]   And they're still using that engine.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.040]   I've told you this story before.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.560]   The reason it recognizes my handwriting
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.640]   is I happen to be in Moscow.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   He needed some handwriting samples,
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.080]   and I loaned him my logbook.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.200]   So was this before after the Soviet Union fell?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.640]   This was in 1989.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.240]   It was as it was full.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.720]   You were probably brought it down.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.680]   It's his fault.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.840]   Well, in a sense, you know, I said back
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.600]   at the time of the Falkland Islands war
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.520]   that it was getting pretty clear.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.640]   If you take Arthur Kessler said famously
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   that the necessary and sufficient condition for bringing
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.600]   about the collapse of an ideological society
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   would be the free exchange of ideas within it.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.360]   I agree.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:52.960]   I agree with you.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.280]   And if you had all computers,
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.880]   you're going to have the free exchange of ideas.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.720]   So I put those two together in 1982.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.120]   I said the Soviet Union is doomed because if they don't go
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.760]   with learning computer technology and making it widespread,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.640]   they won't be able to win wars.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.400]   That's one of what the Falkland Islands war showed
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.600]   is that high-tech wins.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.160]   But if they do, I don't see how they can survive
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.640]   ideologically.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.320]   Right.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.080]   It's the same issue now with any totalitarian state.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.400]   And so what they do in Turkey and Egypt and anywhere they can,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.680]   they turn off the internet, but it's too late.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.000]   Too late.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.360]   And they can't do it really either.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.480]   It's once the cows left the barn or whatever.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.840]   But you don't have to--
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   We haven't--
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.120]   There are unknown means other than ideologies to--
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.840]   Jerry, you're sinking.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.080]   There we go.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.800]   He sank off the screen.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.080]   And that's who I am.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   You and the family.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.680]   And it looks just like my office in the background.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.480]   It does.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   Little need are Jerry.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.160]   No offense.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.760]   Little cleaner.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.720]   But of course, there is a reason for that, isn't there?
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   Book you readers, you writers are readers.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.000]   So we have in studio with us an interesting fellow.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.160]   He's in Israeli.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.680]   He's the CTO of a company called Robin Labs.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   They do a Siri-like speech recognition.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.920]   It's only on Android right now.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.360]   But they want to put it in cars.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.800]   And before the show, we were looking at it as a demo.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.760]   And it's really kind of impressive natural language.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.280]   Isn't this ultimately the interface?
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.480]   Forget the keyboard, Jerry.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.560]   Don't you want to talk to your Surface Pro?
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.480]   And of course, that's what we did in "Multen Gods"
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.720]   when we were describing these things.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.240]   Do you remember what type?
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.760]   And Heinlein did that in his rather magical car
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.520]   in one of his later models.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.000]   But he looked up at the ceiling and said, be a nice girl
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.800]   and then gave it instructions.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.320]   There are two technologies that are
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.840]   going to make this be the computer, the computer,
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.040]   the smartphone be the computer.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.880]   One is better battery life.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.760]   And the other is effective voice recognition.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.920]   And that eliminates the input issues and the portability issues.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.200]   Except for right with--
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   Jerry, would you really want to write a novel with your voice?
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.280]   I mean, I know people do.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.160]   No, I don't.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:12.680]   I can't.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.720]   Nick Tange as fast as I can type.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.520]   You need there.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.400]   And I know there are people who-- for right--
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.240]   But that's a small minority of people
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.200]   getting smaller all the time.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.040]   Unfortunately.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.600]   Some days soon.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.840]   But if you think about it, if you're a videographer
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.680]   or photographer, the other ways to communicate,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.120]   and these devices are really--
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   it's interesting.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.920]   I mean, people don't buy camcorders anymore, do they?
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.000]   Or even you'd expensive cameras.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.920]   What's the point of a point and shoot camera anymore?
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.200]   Do you find that, Christina?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:42.800]   Definitely.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.200]   Definitely.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.960]   I mean, I went to film school, right?
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.800]   So my actual educational background is in video.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.200]   And almost all my photography, almost all my video
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.760]   that I do on my iPhone or on something else.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.000]   But it's interesting.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.600]   You know, you're pointing about how people
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.640]   are communicating in different ways.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.560]   I heard from very good authority that one of the reasons
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.000]   iOS 8 is going to have multiple keyboards
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.880]   is because of how they've watched people in China
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.520]   and in other countries use some of the different keyboards.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.240]   You know, use the emojis and also use video chat
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.480]   and use some of those other things.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.880]   And one of the reasons that they're
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.240]   going to add the ability to send video clips back and forth
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.000]   is because of how common that is in other places.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.920]   Here's a new--
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.280]   You know, I think it--
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.800]   There's a new social network called Emoji Lee
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.160]   that allows you to communicate only in emojis.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.120]   Wow.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:40.400]   So instead of 140 characters, you get 140 emojis.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.920]   Emoji only network.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.000]   There is no spam.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.200]   Because there is no emoji for spam.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.000]   There's no spam.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.200]   There is one for overzoom.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.520]   We're not sure why, but you can use it.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.240]   No bloody forward this to 10 people memes.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.040]   No stupid hashtags.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.640]   The worst message you could possibly receive?
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.400]   It's a pile of poo.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.160]   Now we know what you're thinking.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.480]   This is satire.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.920]   No one would actually make this thing.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.480]   They did.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.320]   And we--
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.040]   He did.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.280]   Are you in your cohort?
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.440]   Because you're a young person, especially
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.480]   when you're hanging out with us.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.800]   You're really young.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:25.840]   Emojis have started in Japan, took over the world.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.320]   When it wasn't-- for a long time on the iPhone,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.480]   you had to hack it to put emojis in.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.680]   Finally, Apple realized, oh, emojis, people like these.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.280]   They've added it.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.640]   Android has emojis.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.640]   Do you find people communicating a lot with emojis?
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.960]   Yes.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.000]   I mean, it's insane the number of text messages or chats
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.800]   that I'll have where they are entirely an emoji or reaction
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.520]   tips.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:48.960]   What?
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.280]   We've even done stories.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.160]   And I'm a little proud.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.880]   It's kind of awesome.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.200]   Where we've done things like we've told
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.360]   like movie Titanic completely an emoji.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.120]   And we'll do things like we'll do song lyrics or Moby Dick
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.800]   or various great collective works
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.160]   and do it entirely an emoji.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.120]   It's kind of amazing how much you can
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.240]   do with the little pictographed characters.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.320]   But no, I mean, most of my communication with my husband,
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.640]   if I'm being honest, is emoji and reaction tips.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.000]   And it's just kind of a constant stream of that all day long.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.520]   And how's the marriage going?
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.440]   So far so far so far so good.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:26.960]   We'll see.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.160]   You know?
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.760]   But I mean, you know, right now I'll have like the happy--
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.680]   I'll do happy emoji.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.200]   I'll say that.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.840]   But you know, we'll see.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.120]   It limits the arguments.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.840]   I mean, you have to--
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.920]   It really does.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   It really does.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.600]   You know, just send, you know, a reaction
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.440]   tip, some smashing, something when you're angry.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.160]   Were you able to tell the Titanic and emojis?
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   Yes.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.160]   It's a-- I mean, there's not--
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.440]   OK, this is where you need Jerry's filigree.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.200]   Yeah, you'd have-- there isn't a lot of--
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:55.720]   No, no, no.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.360]   We're trying to tell one of Jerry's novels.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:57.880]   You know, novels--
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.400]   That'd be more complicated.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.800]   There would be no way, granted.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.320]   But I mean, you know, when you consider that most--
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.800]   you know, what's the theory that there's
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.960]   something like going like six unique story types or something
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   like archetypes?
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.680]   When you think about that, it becomes pretty simple.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.080]   You know, boy meets girl, you know, boy loses girl,
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.960]   boy gets girl back.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.160]   I mean, that's pretty easy to tell.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.960]   And you know--
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.560]   I'm curious--
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.200]   Characters.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   Did somebody invent--
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.040]   That's funny, boy.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.880]   And that kind of thing.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.680]   Where did these come-- I mean, it's from Japan, right?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.560]   Yeah, it was a cellular carrier.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.320]   So it was-- I can't remember--
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.760]   I think it was in D.T. Tacoma, but it might have been one
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.320]   of the other ones.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.360]   Anyway, they had a--
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.600]   like a wap back in those days, social networks
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.000]   sort of thing for their dumb phones.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.160]   And like, 98, 99 is when they started developing it.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.680]   And one of the ways that they wanted to make it
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.720]   is that people could communicate
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.400]   was that they created these little characters.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.480]   And it wasn't originally part of the ASCII specification
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.280]   or part of any of the Unicode stuff.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.240]   It was just something they created themselves.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.160]   And then that became popular on that carrier.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.760]   And then the other carriers adopted it,
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.440]   but made their own kind of modifications.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.920]   And so for a few years, there was like three versions
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.000]   of the emoji characters that were all sort of incompatible.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.160]   And then it became like a part of the extended Unicode
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.240]   thing that wasn't fully adopted until 2010.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.120]   But Apple added it, I think, in 2008
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.920]   when they were on the iPhone in Japan
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.200]   and then brought it to all iPhones in 2009.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.360]   In case you can't tell, I had to write a history of emoji
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   about it once--
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.760]   I asked the right person.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.680]   I'll get to tell you.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.720]   Wow.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.120]   So I had to learn all this because I
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.080]   had to figure out really like who decides on Unicode standards
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.600]   and had to go through all--
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.640]   anyway, I learned way more about the Unicode process
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.600]   than I ever wanted to, but I also learned about emoji.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.920]   But yeah, I mean, it basically came from someone really smart
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.520]   at a phone carrier who they were trying to create
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.480]   a differentiated way of people to communicate.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   And Japan is the perfect place for this, right?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.320]   Because it's very difficult for people
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.760]   to text characters mean different things
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.600]   in different contexts.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.320]   So pictographs are a much easier way
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.800]   to get a message across than trying
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.240]   to use a Japanese soft keyboard or to type things in,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.360]   especially on a flip phone.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.720]   So creating those characters was a huge boon.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.520]   And it just took off.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.920]   And so people just kind of--
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.960]   I mean, that's kind of the beauty of it
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.600]   is that it can kind of be applied to almost anything.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.960]   So the new Unicode, which was announced a couple of months
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.440]   ago, has 250 emojis in the Unicode.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:30.320]   It's now just-- it's officially part of the character set.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.800]   Those are those the canonical--
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.720]   I can't even believe I want to use this phrase--
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.440]   canonical emojis that--
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   Yes.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.520]   There's a standard--
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.600]   So there's--
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.880]   So there have already been a couple hundred emojis
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.320]   that we've been using for the last few years that are available.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.120]   And then Unicode approved another, I think, 300.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.280]   And it'll be up to each individual company.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.480]   So Apple will make their approval Android, Microsoft,
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.080]   whoever to adopt what they want.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.240]   And you know, Apple will be more ethically diverse now?
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   Can we add a lack of that diversity, yeah?
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.600]   Well, they are a little bit better with that.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.440]   The problem was--
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.920]   What ethnicity are those smiley faces?
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.880]   Those are not--
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.520]   But then they're things you can't fully man's hand, man,
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.080]   moving moments, and in their other faces, where things are not.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.240]   And the thing is that all Unicode does
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.840]   is describe the pictograph and have a basic drawing
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.680]   of how it could be portrayed, but it could be drawn in any way.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.000]   The problem is, is they didn't fully solve the diversity
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.840]   complaints because the most current version of the Unicode
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.960]   standard went into discussions a few years ago.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.200]   So all the problems that were brought up recently
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.560]   was basically after--
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.840]   you know, it was too late to get it into this round.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.480]   But what companies like Apple and Twitter and Facebook
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.120]   and other people who have their own emoji libraries can do
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.040]   is they can maybe try to draw them to be more diverse.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.000]   Well, let's look at the pile of poo, shall we?
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.280]   Yes, the pile of poo is the best.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.600]   But what's interesting is Google's pile of poo
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.800]   doesn't have a face on it, but Apple does.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.600]   Yes.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.680]   So Apple's--
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.240]   Microsoft declined to put a face on the pile of poo,
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.680]   but Twitter not only has a face, but apparently a happy face.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.280]   A happy face.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.880]   He has a mouth.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.680]   I mean, that's kind of the interesting thing about emoji
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.480]   too, is to comment on what your device you're on.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.400]   It depends on what-- you know, it looks like.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.720]   Apple's have been drawn fairly closely
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.160]   to what kind of the original--
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.360]   The Japanese standard.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.160]   Right.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.560]   And they've kind of carried that on.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.880]   And most people who ate kind of the thing
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.640]   followed that line, but Google obviously
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   has its own design.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.800]   It's kind of Android-based.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.960]   Twitter made the decision to draw its own.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.120]   What's interesting is that the Chrome browser actually
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.160]   doesn't display emoji, which is messed up and annoying.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.320]   It doesn't.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.920]   I'm on some pages and I'm getting boxes on the Wiki page.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   Exactly.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.640]   And it's annoying, because even if you have an emoji font
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.360]   library installed on Windows or an OS X,
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.200]   it won't pull it in.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.920]   Firefox put in a patch that, as long as you have an emoji font,
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.440]   installed on your system, it'll use the system font.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.360]   Apparently, something that's coming for the next Canary
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.800]   version of Chrome, I don't know.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.720]   I find it ironic only because Google
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.880]   was the very first company to push for emoji
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.120]   to be part of the Unicode standard.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.480]   Yet they're like the last browser maker that actually
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.720]   supports emoji in line.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.600]   But hey.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.440]   Do you think there's going to be a war among differing emoji
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.360]   interpretable-- well, for instance,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.240]   from the, believe it or not, Unicode.org site.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.640]   Yes.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.920]   An example of different lollipops.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   And these are all considered compliant.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.520]   But they can be black and white.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.440]   They can be color.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.880]   As you saw, the poo is smiling in Apple's world,
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.840]   but steaming in Google's world.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.200]   There's really some variation.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.880]   I mean, I guess it could kind of be
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.080]   like different dialects, you know?
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.760]   I mean, different type of pigeon.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.600]   Because I mean, that's really what most people compare kind
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.440]   of emoji to.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.280]   It's a pigeon, exactly.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.920]   It's a pigeon.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.640]   Wow.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.880]   What do you think of this, Jerry?
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.760]   Is this crazy?
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.520]   Well, it strikes me as setting the art of writing back
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.320]   about 15,000 years.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:05.840]   Literally.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.120]   I mean, we're going to higher up--
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:07.680]   That's true.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.960]   --writing, aren't we?
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.400]   Yes.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.880]   We are.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.560]   How many of you was doing it?
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.520]   Not phonetics.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.160]   That's, of course, what our public schools have been trying
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.640]   to do to the English language for the last 50 years.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.880]   And they've been so successful that the literacy rate
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.720]   of the United States is about a pre-war Iraq.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.080]   But--
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.480]   Well, what's interesting is now kids are, I think,
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.040]   maybe they're literacy and emojis
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.200]   as higher than they're in the English.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.080]   Well, but--
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.320]   Is it as expressive do you feel?
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:48.200]   Leo, I have in my collection of stuff
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.360]   that I think to write about a pile of newspapers
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.160]   written in pigeon.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.640]   Really?
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.520]   Yes, pigeon English.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.800]   You know, father, belong you and me, belong you, me.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   Wow.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.200]   Where are they from?
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   The New Scotland.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.320]   New Scotland.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.000]   That's an official language there.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.640]   They conduct elections in it.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.440]   And they have newspapers printed in it.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.480]   The problem is that there's only about 900 words
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.400]   in the language.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.600]   Well, there's only 700-some emojis.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.320]   So that is a considerable screen.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   In Chinese ideographs, there's hundreds of thousands.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.360]   You're going to have a hell of a job writing a decent novel,
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.720]   900 words.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.080]   I don't know how many words they're in Yiddish,
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.800]   but that's another example of a language that evolved from--
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.360]   essentially people who didn't--
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.000]   so they have formal training.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.360]   These languages evolved.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   And even English.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.760]   But you haven't had it built on a language
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.840]   that already existed around it.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.720]   And it, of course, so did pigeon.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:52.920]   But--
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.720]   Right.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.880]   Emojis, I guess.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.320]   Although, well, there's some cultural biases.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.160]   You mentioned Christina.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.440]   This is one of the emojis is a Tanabata tree,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.880]   which wouldn't mean anything to anybody who's not in Japan.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.680]   It's a kind of bamboo where they hang good wishes on it.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.760]   There's the moon viewing ceremony, which, again,
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.240]   is something exclusively Japanese.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.600]   So there's a lot of Japanese-only emojis.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.000]   Yeah, no, that's what's interesting,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.280]   is moving forward, it seems like, because the Unicode space can
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.400]   have extra characters depending on what country it's in,
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.080]   is that they're already kind of anticipating different countries
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.680]   having their own kind of cultural emojis maybe.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.400]   So you might have different--
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.680]   the first biggest request was actually for more flags.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.840]   They wanted more country flags.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.400]   People really wanted to be able to show their national pride.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.280]   And I think maybe beyond that, you
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.680]   might start to see some very specific things
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.120]   to what's happening.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.360]   Can you communicate?
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.480]   Could you, I mean, effectively communicate among two
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.680]   people who speak different spoken languages using emojis?
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.560]   Would it be how efficient would it be?
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.400]   How good would it be?
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.680]   How detailed would it be?
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.880]   That's a really interesting point.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.800]   I was actually thinking that.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.600]   I was thinking that would actually
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.640]   be, I think, a really interesting--
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.880]   genuinely, I think that would be an interesting academic study
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.680]   to look at how people could communicate using--
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.800]   I mean, that guess to be the same as any sort of pictograph.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.520]   But if you could use maybe that mix with some other things
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.440]   to talk with someone when there's a language barrier.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   I didn't realize what a difference there
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.480]   is and how the emojis are rendered.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.800]   Here's that moon ceremony.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.920]   Apple does it in a very detailed, very pretty fashion.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.440]   But Google does it in a more stylized.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.920]   And I kind of like it better.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.480]   Fashion and Twitter has its own thing.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.960]   You could tell they're the same emoji,
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.080]   but there's definitely a variation in how it's expressed.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.640]   I think this is fascinating.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.400]   I don't know what to make of it, but isn't this
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.640]   how new languages emerge?
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.600]   It totally is.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.360]   And I guarantee you in five years' time,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.480]   there are going to be so many academic PhD thesis on emoji
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.400]   and linguistics study.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.160]   Like, there are going to be so many linguistic papers
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.200]   about emoji.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.680]   I mean, you know that there are in progress right now.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.320]   You have spent enough time--
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.000]   Again, aren't you really just facilitating illiteracy?
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.560]   No, it's a different kind of literacy, Jerry.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.880]   It's a different kind.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.560]   How many haikos are you going to write in emojis?
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.080]   Well, I don't think it's going to-- it's not
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.360]   going to eliminate English.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.200]   But I think there might be a place for it.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.960]   Well, Mr. Heinlein, I got an email from a reader
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.120]   who's watching this.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:33.000]   And he points out that Mr. Heinlein predicted back in--
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.520]   way back in one of his older novels
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:41.160]   that a computer reading of text and everything
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.280]   would reduce a lot of the country to illiteracy.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.000]   And of course, that was the novel that
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.520]   had abandoned areas in it, which is pretty close to what we
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   have.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.960]   I listen to audio books and love audio books.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.040]   I listen to your books.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.120]   I don't think that's illiterate.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.200]   No.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.960]   No, I mean, if you're doing it as an addition to, that's fun.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.720]   I just can read.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.160]   But I like to listen.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.080]   And you know, our friend Trey Radcliffe,
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.120]   photographer Trey Radcliffe, has been saying for some time
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.800]   that thanks to the popularity of Instagram
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.440]   and other similar platforms among younger people,
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.560]   that the visual image is rapidly becoming
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.320]   the preferred form of communication.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.800]   Look at Snapchat, which has some text,
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   but really is mostly about the image.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.160]   Instagram is all about the image.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.560]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.440]   No, I do too.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.600]   I have a lot of friends who are hearing impaired.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.200]   And so it's sort of interesting in that context
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.120]   when you look at whether it's ASL or BSL or any
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.720]   of the various variations of, you know, sign language,
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.960]   which are all different, by the way,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.560]   which is another really interesting thing.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   Yes.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.560]   Yes.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   The way that you can kind of get messages across.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.840]   And that's actually one way where I think emoji
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.200]   does become interesting, not maybe with people who
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.880]   speak different, you know, languages, whether it's
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.560]   English and Spanish.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.440]   But with friends of mine who are, you know, hearing impaired,
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.520]   we do communicate a lot in emoji because--
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   Interesting.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   --you know, as well as text things.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   Interesting.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.600]   And you get the same sort of message across.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.120]   And you know, they face time with people all the time.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.160]   I mean, that's the easiest way.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.160]   Because they can sign.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.160]   It's just face time and sign.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   Yeah, because you can sign.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   But to do other things, you know, where you can just kind of
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.640]   get, you know, a message across.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.800]   It's a good way to just kind of have a shorthand.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.200]   I mean, I agree with Jerry's point.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.240]   You definitely could.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.520]   It could be the death of literacy.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.600]   But I think that--
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.600]   I feel like it's--
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.360]   if language evolves, I mean, right?
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.200]   I mean, that's what happens.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.840]   Language evolves.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.680]   And I don't know if it's going to evolve
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.240]   into a digital form or, you know, pictographs
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.960]   and really be, I guess, debought as it were or not.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.080]   But it is interesting how, just in a few years,
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:52.000]   it's been able to kind of really take on steam.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.920]   I don't worry about that so much, Jerry,
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.440]   because I think the human urge to communicate nuance
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.640]   won't go away, right?
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.040]   Right.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.640]   And if you look, we think television, right,
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.920]   for 60 years.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.480]   And people thought that would kill literacy.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.880]   Yeah, you know, and people thought comic books would kill
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.080]   books, and paperbacks would kill hardbacks,
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.400]   and, you know, somehow destroy literacy.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.600]   I don't worry about it.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.920]   I mean, as long as--
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.120]   you know, as long as we have a decent education, well--
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.440]   But there's a big problem.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   That's my real problem.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.360]   Have a decent education.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:19.960]   There's a big problem.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.160]   That is a problem, I agree.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.640]   That's by the way, a local problem here in the United States.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.200]   I think liberals and circus and all agree.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.480]   Not entirely local.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.040]   Can I put in a plug for my newest book?
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   Yes.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:31.400]   Sure.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.680]   I have just put up on Amazon.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.280]   It's not mine.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:41.000]   I found the 1914 California sixth grade reader.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.400]   And I added some comments to it.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.840]   It's all public domain stuff, of course, the comments on.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.160]   And it had some pretty good introductory materials
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.800]   about the people who had prepared it.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.760]   So I've put it all together, and it's up on Amazon.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.560]   Oh, I'm going to buy it.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.720]   How interesting.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.680]   California sixth grade reader is what it's called.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.280]   We actually have it.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.400]   I live with a sixth grader.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.280]   I'll see if he can read any of it.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:05.960]   That's it.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.040]   Right there.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:07.800]   Very interesting.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:08.840]   What a good idea, Jerry.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.720]   I think this is a whole new area for you.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.080]   There's a long story attached to it.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.360]   I had it and talked about it in my columns.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.640]   And some of my readers, this is back before scanning,
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.520]   actually typed the whole darn thing in so that I could put it up.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.960]   I don't know if I could read this.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.520]   I don't know if I could read this.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.160]   I don't know if I could read this.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:30.520]   Look at this.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.920]   I got that brain cancer, and it delayed doing anything
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.800]   for a long time.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.480]   I'm glad you've really--
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.400]   It's on Amazon.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.400]   I just got around to finishing it with the help of a lot
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.400]   of friends and advisors and a whole bunch of people
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.840]   there in the acknowledgments.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.720]   But--
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.760]   This is sixth grade.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.720]   This blows me away.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.760]   I'll weigh it up in the hopes that homeschoolers will
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.320]   find it useful.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.840]   This I would consider--
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.800]   I have a tale of heroes who sailed away into a distant land
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.520]   to win themselves renowned forever.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.720]   In the invention of the Golden Fleece, with her, they--
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.680]   with her, with her, they sailed.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.120]   I cannot clearly tell.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.000]   It all happened a long ago, so long ago.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   It has all grown--
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.680]   This is wild.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.200]   The old Greek said, hung in cultures, nailed to a beach--
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.000]   And there was a time, Leo, when every literate person
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.120]   in the United States would have read, though,
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.400]   essentially the stories that are in that book--
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.680]   Well, I'll grant you that we are not in that time anymore.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.320]   This is well beyond, I would say, what--
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.880]   But wait.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.360]   We are in a time in which half the population
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.720]   is likely to be useless.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.200]   That is, they are not able to do anything
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.640]   that any rational person would pay the money to do.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.880]   That's why it's a service economy.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.800]   Well, but what service can they perform?
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.840]   Well, it's always a service.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.040]   If you look at I-kinds, you can work at McDonald's.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.400]   You don't need to read.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:58.920]   But you do understand that much of what goes on at McDonald's
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.640]   is easily automated.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.680]   And if you decide to get pay a minimum wage of $15 an hour
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.920]   to the person who works at McDonald's,
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.880]   you basically have in this era of cheap capital borrowing,
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.040]   you have taken away a decision from the McDonald's
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.280]   franchise owner.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.840]   I remember when McDonald's converted their cash register
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.920]   to icons.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.960]   And you don't have to make change anymore,
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.320]   because it tells you what the change is.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.400]   It makes it unlikely.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.760]   Well, they encourage customers to use a debit or credit card
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.720]   so you don't even have to handle money
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.040]   if they're using it or their phones someday.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:33.920]   All right, we're going to stop.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.240]   Because I'm getting depressed.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:35.800]   And I don't know.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.320]   We went down an emoji rabbit hole,
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.280]   but it was kind of interesting, frankly.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.560]   I find this stuff fascinating.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.280]   We do know, according to 9 to 5,
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.400]   Mac Mark Gurman, who's pretty good on this stuff,
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.040]   Apple will announce the new iPhone, probably
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:52.280]   the second or third week in September, no surprise there.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.560]   Christina, you agree, unlikely to see anything
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.080]   but a 4.7-inch iPhone.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.080]   That would be a big step for Apple.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.040]   That would be-- I mean, to me, that seems like that's
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.440]   as big as--
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   That's enough.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.000]   That's enough.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.880]   I mean, I know a lot of people are buying the fabblets
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.440]   and they're really popular, but that
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.680]   goes against so many of Apple's own kind of design cues.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.280]   And I think most people really would be--
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.120]   most people, I think, are going to be satisfied with that.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.560]   So yeah, I don't see if I have a 1/2-inch iPhone coming.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.080]   I really don't.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.280]   You agree, Larry?
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.680]   I will go public.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.080]   I'm with you on that.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.120]   You and I are the only two, by the way, Christina.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.160]   I think iPhone users will be happy enough with the difference
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.560]   that they will go ahead and buy the new iPhone.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.360]   I don't think they're going to win away a lot of customers who
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.440]   already have larger Android phones.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.880]   And let's say offer some other great features
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.640]   that we're not seeing on Android.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.360]   But I think to keep the iPhone users happy, sure,
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.560]   that'll be fine.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.720]   And Wither-- if I might use a word I learned from the 1914
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.640]   reader--
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.360]   Wither the iPad.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.680]   I presume an October announcement for an iPad, maybe,
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.920]   and I watch.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.440]   What could they do in the iPad that
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.520]   would make it compelling as fingerprint readers?
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.240]   The only thing missing--
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:02.800]   Yeah, Touch ID.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.920]   Touch ID is-- I mean, right now, personally,
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.800]   I think that the iPad Air is--
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.320]   I love it.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.960]   It's my favorite tablet that I own.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.240]   Yeah, it's-- to me, I don't think--
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.040]   I don't know how you could physically design it
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.160]   to be any better, except for a Touch ID sensor.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.440]   Maybe an 8 or something, a faster processor.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.600]   Right, I mean, you can make some right.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.440]   But I mean, but as far as the industrial design,
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.360]   like, this, to me, feels like the pinnacle.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.520]   It feels like when they reined in on the current--
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.240]   I macbook air thing.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.560]   And when they got the unibotting mac down,
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.120]   you kind of get down like the pinnacle of design.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.240]   So I don't know.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.560]   You think about the other things that we own, right?
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.120]   Every year, do you go out and see what's
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.560]   the latest refrigerator, because I want to update my refrigerator.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.520]   Yes, exactly.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.600]   I've had my high-def TV now for five years,
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.080]   and it was a 1080p, and it had 4 HDMI ports.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.600]   And I have absolutely no interest in buying a new one.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.040]   Well, thanks to you, the entire television industry is fine.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:56.760]   Exactly.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.880]   Well, I think the tablet is the same.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.640]   You love your MacBook Air.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.040]   You're going to love it a year from now,
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.000]   and it's going to be just as good a year from now.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.160]   Better, actually, because there'll be a new iOS out, hopefully.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.520]   And in a way, Apple has created its own problem
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.760]   by doing such a great job.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.400]   But if they didn't do a great job,
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.120]   they'd be in worse trouble than they're in now.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.160]   Actually, they're not in trouble.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.960]   They'd be in trouble.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.000]   So they just have to come up with a new product category
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.440]   and hope we love the iWatch or whatever it is.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.840]   They do come out, finally.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.880]   And I think the industry as a whole
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.600]   has to come up to the expectation that if you're
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.920]   going to be spending more than $400 on a tablet,
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.160]   it's something that you keep for X number of years
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.280]   versus replacing every year or every two years
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.520]   like you do with the phone.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.760]   Because you don't have the same wear and tear
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.400]   with the tablet you do with the phone.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.440]   And as you said, yeah, most people
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.240]   works great for them year after year,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.520]   so they don't feel a need to upgrade.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.680]   But I think if the expectations are online,
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.120]   then it proves it can be a viable business,
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.920]   but it's just not going to be as big as the phone.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.880]   Oh, you'll have to excuse me.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.760]   Kim Kardashian is calling me right now.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.400]   Hey, it's Kim.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.760]   I wanted to let you know you're all set to come by the shoot.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.000]   See, this is why you need a bigger iPad.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.800]   Yep.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.600]   Yep.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.120]   I won't lie.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.400]   I've paid money for that.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.440]   Well, who has the writer spent $400 bucks in the game?
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.320]   Somebody from Gizmodo.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.760]   And I'm kind of jealous she wrote that post
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.400]   because I like two and a half weeks before she did that.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.520]   I downloaded it like the week it became huge, ironically.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.120]   And then I wound up blowing like $20 or $30 on it.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.280]   And I thought about trying to write anything about this.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.080]   And it wasn't getting a lot of mainstream buzz.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:26.800]   I was too early.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.720]   This is always my problem.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.960]   I'm always too early.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.400]   And if I had just gone for it, I could have been like the first one
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.400]   on the block about the craziness.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.760]   Shamed in public.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.960]   Oh, but I shaved myself.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.000]   I mean, I mean, come on.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.200]   If you say money, yes, design yourself, Leo.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.920]   Like, it's a nice time chat.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.600]   So good.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.640]   So let's try out the controls for Girona here.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.520]   With the K.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.080]   Yeah, that's how we know your hip and with it.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.320]   This is so funny.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.440]   Everything's with the K. Customize with the K, right?
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.880]   Well, exactly.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.360]   So I named my own character Christina with the KH,
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.720]   which I thought was funny.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.040]   I thought that was fitting.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.120]   But I did create my own character.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.440]   The story is fascinating.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.440]   This company, Glue, actually developed this program
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.040]   as a separate program.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.040]   And they released it and it was a success.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.840]   But then what did Kim Kardashian come calling?
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.200]   What happened?
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.560]   Yeah, I mean, they basically said, OK, well, we can license it.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.880]   They jiggered a few things.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.400]   And that's basically, I think it was called their--
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.400]   It's the same game.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.720]   Something is the exact same game.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.840]   They just reskinned it.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.440]   She got a big paycheck out of it.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.320]   And something about her appeal.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.960]   And I think, honestly, the fact that the public both loves
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.360]   and hates her with equal interest.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.080]   And then here's the real secret.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.960]   The game is actually really well done.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.520]   It's pretty good.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.800]   It's getting people to pay more money.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.560]   It's a really good this type of game.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.000]   It's a really good--
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.040]   the grinding is addictive enough that you want to pay.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.840]   The in-app purchases are--
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.200]   they come in enough that you really kind of
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.560]   want to go through the process.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.320]   So they've got all the mechanics down.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.560]   And so if you add that with a public figure who--
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.360]   most of the world, both loves or hates--
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.920]   and I'm in the latter category.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.400]   I'm going to call myself--
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.080]   I'm going to call myself--
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.720]   K-chief K-wit.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.200]   There you go.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.520]   Gotta have a K, right?
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.360]   Yep.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.640]   But I mean, I probably appreciate school day.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.120]   Yes.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.240]   I picked that outfit out for her.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:31.880]   It was great.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.480]   Jira, you're worried about literacy.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.480]   And this is happening.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.280]   This is what the real--
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.960]   this is the real pretzel literacy right here
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.120]   is the card out.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.600]   You could be reading a book.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.640]   I've heard $1,000.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.320]   I agree.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320]   Well--
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.760]   You could be reading Valley of the Dolls.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.720]   And that's what we should be reading instead of--
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.120]   You'd be not reading it.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.560]   You'll have to understand something, Leo.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.080]   I don't need everybody in the United States
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.480]   to buy one of my books.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.200]   I just need a million a year to pay me a dollar.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.680]   You see, so while the rest of us
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.880]   are playing with Kim Kardashian, as long as a few of you
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.680]   are buying Jerry's books, all will be well.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.720]   Yeah, well, now it is that.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.920]   But the people who don't have anything else
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.640]   to do have got to do something.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.960]   Nobody will pay you much money to do that.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.040]   But at least it beats your being out robbing stores.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:26.160]   The new thing is-- and Kristina, I bet you do this.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.600]   You're watching TV or listening to a book
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.360]   while you're doing it.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:30.880]   Yep.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.560]   Yep.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.520]   So it's not that you're doing this all by itself by no means.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.360]   Leo, you're making--
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.040]   No, this is--
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:36.880]   --why you're doing it.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.440]   It's a two point earlier.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.960]   You're actually on the air right now, buddy.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.000]   I'm doing a show.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.800]   And I'm keeping up with the Kardashians.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.960]   This is the past.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.840]   You were talking earlier about how
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.120]   the past focus about how your best ideas come in the shower.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.440]   I play Candy Crush or Bejeweled or Three's or other games
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.320]   while I'm in meetings.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.920]   And I have to explain to people going in, I'm not being rude.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.160]   I'm actually completely 100% paying attention to you.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.640]   But I will actually be able to focus on what you're saying
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.280]   better if my hands are busy.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.680]   How's that working out for you?
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680]   I thought you were going to tell me
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.880]   you had a water-resistant iPad that
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.200]   you play games in the shower.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.680]   Do they buy that, Christina?
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.160]   Because I want to use that excuse.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.200]   Really?
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.000]   You know why they do?
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.760]   Because it's true.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.160]   Because then they'll call me on something and I'll pipe up.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.800]   I'm not really paying deep attention to the game.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.800]   I'm just-- it's one of those things
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.160]   that is taking my subconscious attention.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.600]   It's taking the attention to that.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.760]   And I can focus on what's happening elsewhere.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.400]   But my hands need to be busy.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400]   And I've been like that as long as I was a kid.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.520]   I used to get trouble.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.280]   It's ADD.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.760]   You can't look at her.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.000]   She wasn't doing that.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   She'd have to be taking Ritalin.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.440]   I think that's exactly right, Jerry.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.200]   I think it's ADD.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.480]   And I'm ADD.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.960]   Those of us who are ADD and many, many, many, many people
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.360]   in this industry are ADD.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:47.720]   That's right.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:47.920]   We need--
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.280]   I am ADD, yes.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.240]   So what the deal is-- and I found out
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   because I investigated this for myself--
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.480]   is our frontal lobe is depressed.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.560]   It's not moving as fast as you normal people.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.480]   Precisely.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.440]   So we need to stimulate it just to keep it
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.200]   at a normal level.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.240]   So you could hit yourself in the head
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.920]   or you could play the Kim Kardashian game.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.960]   It's about the same.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.640]   Basically, and actually, the person--
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.320]   when I figured this out when I was really young
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.800]   and when I told my shrink about this a number of years ago--
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.760]   it was just speaking of TMI, yes, my shrink.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.920]   And he thought it was a great idea.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.560]   No, no, but he thought it was brilliant.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.200]   He was like, oh, I'm really glad you come up
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.600]   with that sort of solution.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.920]   And I didn't realize it was a solution.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.040]   It was just something that I intrinsically
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.000]   did to figure out how to better manage that.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   But that's exactly right.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.120]   It's because we're ADD.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.800]   And it's just one of those things that I concentrate way
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.960]   better if I'm just mindlessly tapping on the screen.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.800]   So here's the question I have.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.800]   Are ADD people naturally attracted to tech and to this?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.760]   Or-- and I think there might be some evidence for it--
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.160]   is all of this stimulus making us all a little bit attention
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.000]   deficit?
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.840]   What do you think, Jerry?
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.280]   I think that you're getting closer when you say that.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.200]   There is just a lot more destruction now than there used
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.120]   to be.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.880]   I haven't seriously done psychology practice
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.840]   since the old early '70s when I was partnered
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.440]   with a pediatrician in Los Angeles.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.640]   And the only cases I ever took were what we described
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.200]   as bright kids who weren't doing well.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.120]   Yeah, that's--
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.440]   In those days, nobody had ever heard of ADD and ADD.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.560]   And ADD and all the other literate things.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.320]   And in my graduate school work in psychology
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.840]   when I got my doctorate, I think we spent two days on autism
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.560]   in four years.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.480]   So we had to come up with things.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.600]   I would love to have had that Kardashian game to prescribe
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.960]   to some of those kids.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.160]   It is better than Ritalin.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.320]   The big problem with drugs is you are not
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.200]   learning to control yourself.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.040]   And I think the drug is the--
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.920]   I'm a little hero.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.240]   You are not learning it.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.200]   I had to deal with it because there was--
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:13.960]   You're a kid.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.920]   You're not doing him any favors by giving him Ritalin.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.480]   I was distracted and I was--
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.480]   there didn't have that diagnosis when I was a kid.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.240]   But I learned to play chess and do stuff that helped me focus.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.160]   And I bet, Christina, you did the same thing.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.120]   Were you undiagnosed as a kid?
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.160]   No, I was diagnosed.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.080]   Then we all--
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.000]   I mean, come on.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.760]   Isn't that the case of almost everybody listening to this show?
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.520]   If you're smart, you're bored.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.120]   Totally.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.680]   And I always-- yeah, like you, I mean,
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.000]   I came up with other ways to do things.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.640]   And I was always a high achiever.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.400]   So I didn't fit the perfect mold where
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.840]   you have the really bright kid who's not doing well
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.360]   because I also kind of OCD and perfectionist.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.120]   So you made sure you did do well.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:56.640]   Right.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.720]   But I would find myself kind of--
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.400]   I would find a way to entertain myself in boredom moments
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.560]   or get moved to a different class or something like that.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.720]   Well, you did what Larry said.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.120]   But you have had to move on.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.760]   More choices as entertainment than people.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.960]   I mean, when I'm growing up at--
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.320]   I'm not aging during World War II in capableville, Tennessee,
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   there's nothing-- there's no television.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:20.840]   You had public shows.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.720]   I'm not allowed to have radio.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.840]   I did get to read the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.360]   There you go.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.280]   I did that too.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   That's you to make nitro glycerin, which wasn't anything--
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.840]   that pleased my parents.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.000]   Folks, we refer you to the triangulation with Jerry
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.720]   Pranella, which he talks about blowing up the fish pond.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.440]   Luckily, I'm going to secure you with it around this time.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.960]   Another time.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.280]   No, we talked about it on the show.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.280]   No, honestly, I mean, one of the reasons I know as much
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.400]   about random things as I do is because I read a lot.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.000]   And that was what I picked up as a kid.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.320]   I would just read-- I read voraciously.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.720]   And I would get interested in a topic.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.120]   And I would read everything I could about it.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.520]   And when I got interested in computers, when I was 12,
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.160]   that was literally-- I went to the library.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.080]   And I got every book, every magazine that I could get.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.120]   And just started obsessing and never stopped.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.680]   So yeah, I do agree-- I do worry a little bit.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.480]   Maybe kids are too distracted by some of this stuff,
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.120]   as much as I love it from maybe reading.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.440]   But there's, I think, a good balance that could be made.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.200]   And there's definitely, I think, an opportunity for educators
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.640]   to make interesting games or learning
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.960]   games that could really kind of no break into stuff.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.560]   Well, while we're on this topic, let me point out that in--
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.720]   there I am in Capableville, Tennessee.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.640]   But the books we're reading in school
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.480]   were things like that California sixth grade reader.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.160]   We had Jason and the Aragonauts.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.280]   We had Horatius at the Bridge.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.760]   We had, under the spreading chestnut tree,
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.160]   the village Smithie and so forth.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.320]   We had a great deal more intellectually stimulating
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.680]   stories in our classrooms than they
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680]   are teaching in any classroom I know of
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.600]   in the public school system today.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.000]   Let me put in an optimistic word for at least some educators
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.960]   and some connected learning classrooms
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.640]   where kids, whatever amount of information they're consuming,
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.960]   they're actually also creating information.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.320]   And whether it's posting videos to YouTube's or blogging
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.760]   or even polishing up their Facebook or Twitter accounts,
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.720]   there is a great deal of creativity and interactivity
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.560]   and connected learning going on.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.400]   And in many ways, it's a resurgence.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.760]   Jerry, I'm not quite as old as you are,
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.000]   but I remember the '60s.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.440]   I was ran a program at Berkeley called
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.120]   the Center for Participant Education
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.960]   where we did student initiated courses
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.040]   and student centered learning.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.240]   And that's actually making a comeback now, partially
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.160]   because of technology and partially because there
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.760]   are some really great teachers out there who, despite their bosses,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.040]   are doing amazing things with technology and kids are being
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.120]   creative.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.720]   But you just said it despite their bosses.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.600]   The purpose of the public school system is to pay bad teachers.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.840]   Well, if any kids show up some teacher as a bad teacher,
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.080]   the system is designed to suppress that kid.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   Well, without with you and I with a kid,
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.560]   I had probably 18 years of bad, well, I had 12 years of bad teachers
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.600]   through K-12 with one or two exceptions.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.040]   I bet everybody who listens to this show, everybody who's a twit fan
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.160]   is very much like us, where they were smart kids.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.240]   They perhaps would like Christina and OCD,
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.400]   or perhaps like me, we're always told you,
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.680]   you have such potential.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:31.240]   Exactly.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.280]   You never live up to your potential.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.960]   Adley, you and I go to the same school, I heard the same thing.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.040]   Of course we did.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.400]   And I think that probably 90% of the people
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.360]   who listen to these shows who are tech buffs, who are interested
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.400]   in this stuff, who are all smart because you need
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.440]   to have some intelligence to understand this and to delve into it.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.600]   Probably dealt with the same thing.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.600]   But the good news to me is we all adapted.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.000]   We all found a way.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.720]   Humans are amazingly adaptive.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.640]   And yeah, even if teachers are bad, it's nice if you get one great teacher.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.040]   I think any human can expect in life is one great teacher.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.920]   If you get that, you're--
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.000]   You're a great teacher.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.160]   And not having an administrator whose job it is to suppress the great teacher.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.960]   Well, the other thing is I hate to admit it, but being ADD
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.080]   is really a great credential for being on live radio.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.120]   You can't really agree.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.560]   There's something to be said for being able to make something.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.240]   I can handle stuff.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.320]   I've got people in my ear.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.240]   I've got things going on.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.000]   I just took a walk around the block while you were talking.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.360]   So I keep--
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.680]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.280]   I want to come back.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.880]   Well, I'm going to talk about shaving for a moment if you don't mind.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.840]   By the way, as always, when you get smart, interesting people together,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.440]   you end up talking about such wide ranging, fascinating things.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.800]   I just want to thank you three.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.640]   Jerry Pournell, Larry Maggot, Christina Warren, it's always a pleasure
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.480]   to have the three of you on.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.600]   I'm waiting to figure out what you're going to call this show.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.040]   I think smartphone scabbard right now is the leading contender.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.560]   That's good.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.520]   I want one.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.920]   Our show today brought to you by Harry's.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.200]   It's fascinating what Harry's has been doing.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.000]   It was founded about a year ago by two guys, Andy and Jeff.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.240]   You may know Jeff because he was also the co-founder of Warby Parker.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.640]   In fact, there's some similarities.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.840]   Jeff looked at what was going on in the eyeglasses industry
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.920]   and realized people weren't getting fair prices because of monopoly
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   and so forth.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.200]   It's the same thing in razors.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.080]   What do you pay for a fusion blade, like four bucks?
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.240]   They're so valuable now they lock them up in the drugstore.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.920]   Jeff said there's a way to make a better blade for less,
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.280]   to give people what they want.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.680]   He created Harry's and I, this is the fascinating thing.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.840]   I just found this out.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   They went to Germany.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.040]   There's two factories in all the world that can make a razor blade
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.200]   that doesn't cut you up when you shave.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.040]   They bought one in Germany.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.200]   This is where they make their blades.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.160]   One of the two factories in the world that knows how to do this
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.720]   and they bought it because they wanted to make great blades.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.120]   I think that you, our audience is smart enough.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.240]   Most of the world will go out and they'll use disposable razors
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.880]   and they'll face it will get cut up.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.240]   Next morning they'll forget the whole thing and they'll do it again.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.400]   Or they're people who will pay four bucks for a Gillette fusion or whatever
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.080]   because they want something better.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.000]   Believe me, there's something much better and it's Harry's.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.680]   They focus on giving you a great shaving experience at a fraction of the price.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.240]   I have every other month I get my Sherry's kit.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.480]   I get I think eight blades and two shaving creams.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.240]   By the way, the Sherry shaving cream they sell is phenomenal.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.560]   You can get the Winston, which is the metal blade or the Truman,
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.040]   which is the plastic blade.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.040]   This is a Winston.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.520]   I got mine engraved with my initials, of course.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.280]   And Jeff Niedel's, my initials are LEO.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.480]   He gave me a hard time because he says, "Your initials are not LEO."
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.360]   Well, that's what I use for my initials.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.160]   Beautiful, nice handle.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.360]   This incredible blade.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.680]   I know it's a combination of that plus the amazing shaving cream
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:59.920]   that makes Harry's so, such an experience every morning you're going to look forward to.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.760]   I want you to try it.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.440]   Simple, clean product design at a really great price.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.120]   Ship to your door.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.120]   You're going to try it, right?
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.000]   You're going to go to harries.com right now.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.760]   And when you do, please use your offer code TWIT5.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.720]   You'll get $5 off your first order at harries.com.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.560]   This is, they have reinvented shaving.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.480]   And that's for the ladies too, by the way.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.880]   Don't feel like you can't.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.880]   It could be Harry yet.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   Oh.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.880]   Oh, Harry's.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.240]   Now my wife asked about that whether, because we, we bought one a couple weeks ago.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.040]   I bought one and she wanted to know whether they're with a female version.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.400]   And you're saying the male version will work with women.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   Yeah, we've tried to talk.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.200]   I'm going to do a pink one, but I don't know.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   No, they should.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.800]   So they could make a killing because we spend just as much on our racers.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.800]   You bet.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.520]   I use harries and yeah, works great for women too.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520]   I'm a big fan.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.200]   And so much, so much cheaper than having to go to the drugstore.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.440]   And you get great quality.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.440]   That's the nice thing.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.840]   You actually start to like it shaving in the morning, which is something I did not do
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.280]   for most of my life.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.840]   I look forward to it now.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840]   Please.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840]   We don't worry about going to buy anything.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840]   I could just--
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840]   That's also good.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.840]   Oh, yes.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840]   It's also good.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.640]   I love the fact that there's so many things now that I don't have to go.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640]   I know.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.760]   I don't leave the house.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:14.760]   We have the--
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.560]   Safeway delivers stuff.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.320]   Amazon subscribe and save.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.480]   In fact, I always look for more stuff I could put on subscribe and save.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.960]   I'm doing an article called, you know, how tech is allowing me to be rich, even though
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.440]   I'm not only am I not in the 4x400, if they had a 4x4 million, I'm sure I wouldn't be
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.440]   in either.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.640]   But I have a private chauffeur if I use Uber.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   Uber.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.160]   I have a personal shopper if I use Google Express.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.720]   I've got private chefs now through Munchery.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.240]   It's like, you know, hey, I feel like a millionaire.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.200]   That's the future for the economy.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.640]   There's the future economy, right?
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.400]   There's jobs for all of those people.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.240]   There's jobs and there's lower costs?
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.600]   Well, decent products for a fair price.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.480]   Just nice.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.400]   Public beta for Apple's Yosemite came out this week.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.320]   I can tell you right now, despite all the warnings from everybody, including Apple, to
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:07.480]   not put it on a production machine, to back up all your data, you can't even install it
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.880]   before when you try to install it.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.520]   It says, you backed up, right?
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.840]   I didn't do any of that stuff.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840]   And it's fine.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   It works great.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.280]   I love it.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:23.160]   I can't tell you much about it because unless you're using iOS 8, you know, many of the
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.840]   features like continuity don't do anything.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.560]   But for what I've seen, it's designed as nice.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.040]   I think this is and it's very stable now.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.480]   I think it's probably very close to being ready to shoot.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   I actually advise people not to install it.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   Because you're responsible.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.480]   I only have one app.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.480]   I only have one Mac.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.040]   If you were a PC, I'd put it on one of my spare machines.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.320]   But I have a MacBook Air that I actually use and I do want to take the chance.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.760]   But maybe I will know that you've had good choice.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760]   I haven't had any problems.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.400]   But now I'm using a Mac Pro, it's a late model.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.520]   But I haven't had any problems with it.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.360]   The only thing, PGP doesn't work with it.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   That's all.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.360]   If you can, Larry, if you have an external drive, you can install it on and just use
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.600]   it as a secondary partition.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.960]   That's what I would do it on.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.960]   It's really stable.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.400]   But the problem is that some of the third party apps aren't quite there.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.760]   And so there might be one app that you don't know until you get it on that it's not going
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   to work.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.760]   So what I've done, I have a testing machine at work, but then for my personal use, I've
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.800]   actually got it running on a USB 3 drive.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.360]   Have you run into any apps that don't work?
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.360]   There have been a couple of third party apps that just have had some issues with them not
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.320]   wanting to work exactly correct.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.520]   And some of the developers have been really quick on fixing them.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.960]   But when that's going to get sorted out, it's going to be the first time I've come up.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.560]   I mean, Microsoft always does.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560]   I can't remember it.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.560]   Yes.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:44.160]   This is the first time since the original developer preview for OS 10 was released in
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160]   the year 2000.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   Very first OS 10.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.160]   Right.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   And that was released.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.680]   You paid $30 and you got a DVD or a CD in the mail.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.360]   So this is the first time they've done this.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.640]   And I think that it's two things.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.840]   One, I think that it shows that they're confident.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.920]   As you were saying, Leo, it feels right.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.080]   I think that this shows confidence in their product that they feel like we can open this
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:05.760]   up to a million people and have people tested out.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.960]   But the second thing is I think that they really want to make sure that before they release
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.160]   the final version that any bugs or any things they might be overlooking get fixed.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.120]   Because when Mavericks came out, there was an issue with Gmail and mail.app.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.960]   I didn't have the problem that a ton of people did.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   And I know that the guys at Tedbits wrote a ton of really good stuff about it.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.960]   And Apple fixed it fairly quickly.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.000]   And I have a feeling they want to avoid having those issues pop up again.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   And I think that's great.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   I think that's one of the best things that I've ever done.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   I think that's awesome.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.400]   I've always had millions of beta testers and they still have bugs.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.480]   But we should say Windows has had a public beta for the last two versions.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.480]   Yes, they have.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   Yes, they have.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.280]   And lots and lots of people used it.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.080]   And it didn't matter.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.680]   Still but any of those people say, hey, this Windows 8 thing, bad idea.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   Well, not one.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:56.200]   They have a lot of testimonials of people who claim to love it.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.560]   And video is galore.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:02.520]   Can we now officially say that Windows 8 sucks?
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:07.120]   I think you might have something else that you like your.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.840]   Jerry, you like eight?
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.160]   No, but eight point one isn't all.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.560]   This fixes a lot.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.560]   What an endorsement.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.800]   8.1 not all that bad.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   Microphone.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800]   I've got that on billboards.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.920]   My main machine still runs seven.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.920]   So don't.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:30.560]   I think it's fair to say that Windows 8 got Steve Ballmer fired from his job as CEO.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.320]   Got a great many people, including the guy behind it, Steven Sanovsky.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.320]   Not fired.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:41.840]   I think that you can say, looking at Microsoft's results, that it costs them billions of dollars
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   in upgrades.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.920]   Boy, I can't think of a bigger failure except maybe new Coke.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.920]   Vista.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.280]   No, this is worse than Vista.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.280]   This is worse than Vista.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.960]   The timing of this is way worse.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.320]   That are in fact fairly good, but they could have been grafted on the seven without much
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   difficulty.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.640]   No, I think it's certainly better in many ways.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.240]   They fixed file copying and stuff.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.200]   But what they did with the user interface is.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.200]   An abomination.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.000]   I mean, really, really bad.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.080]   But let me, Leo, again, my experience with eight was pretty miserable until I got this
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:28.520]   session and started updating everything to like Office 365.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.280]   And boy, that is better.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.920]   I do like Office 365.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.920]   I've been very happy with that.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.920]   It sets up better.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:39.960]   Outlook actually is almost a pleasure to get it running now.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:40.960]   Almost there.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.920]   There are a number of things that I used to dread.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.320]   I mean, I didn't want to put outlook on a new machine.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.120]   That's what I was going to think of.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.080]   Oh, well, I better sharpen pencils or carry the Kirby job rather than like sitting down
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080]   to write a novel.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.400]   There's always something that's easier to do.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:06.240]   But I bit the bullet and yesterday we put outlook on four machines and it only took an
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.320]   hour for all four of them.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.640]   So I run Windows 8 on my particular.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.640]   It's 365.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640]   I mean, Office 365.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.960]   No, they've really, they've linked.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.080]   I have to say this is one thing Microsoft does well.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.400]   And what you know, the future for Microsoft is very clear is it's in the cloud.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.080]   It's cloud services.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.440]   It's enterprise.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.320]   I know Microsoft doesn't want to be IBM, but this is the one thing they really still
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.800]   do well, right?
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800]   It is.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.120]   I mean, you know, I think that they lost a lot of ground by being so hesitant to go
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.680]   the cloud route with Office for so long.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:44.120]   You know, I think that if 365 had come out earlier or at least some iteration of that
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.560]   in so many places, wouldn't have gone to Google Docs because I would still, even though I
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.080]   write almost everything in a text editor, you know, I'm one of those, I guess, new old
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.440]   school people and I write everything in Markdown.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.600]   So I write everything in a text editor.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.760]   But I and I've done that for years, but you know, I would much use word than Google Docs.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   I would definitely rather use Excel than, than, you know, Google spreadsheet and with
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.040]   365 having a way to save it, it's great.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.360]   So I use Windows 8.1 on my production machine.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.040]   And the first thing I did is I put this alternative start menu on it.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.880]   So I looked like Windows 7.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]   Of course.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.880]   What else did you do?
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:26.080]   I threw away Windows 365 and replaced it with an old copy of Windows 2010.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   Office.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.880]   Because it, we office 2010.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.320]   I said I would say, yeah, word, mostly word, but Excel, because it works just fine.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320]   It's lean.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.800]   And the reason for me to have to pay an annual membership fee, because they three year old
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.520]   and five year old and two year old versions of office work just fine for what I do.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.000]   And I think Microsoft has the same problem.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:54.920]   On the other hand, I got five stations plus five things like tablets for $100 a year.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   Yeah, that's a good deal.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:56.920]   Yeah, no, it's a good deal.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.840]   I'm going to pay that one way or another.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:08.480]   Now I have an unlimited copies of everything up through Windows 2007 because Microsoft used
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.920]   to just give me unlimited license.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:14.400]   So I haven't been writing the column since then.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:20.720]   So I haven't, I haven't felt all that asked for that kind of extension nowadays.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:27.880]   But now one of the problems with making the, with making a profit in this business is that
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.560]   a lot of stuff just works and works forever.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.560]   I haven't created anything to my stuff for a couple of years because it's always been
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:36.560]   good enough.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.560]   I didn't need to.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.760]   That's kind of the subject to my next column is, well, it turns out sometimes it's worth
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.880]   upgrading, but you don't have to.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.880]   All right.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.680]   Next, you're yourself one of our George Martin has written on word star.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.360]   Word star for God's sake.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.600]   Now I wouldn't do that.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600]   He still knows all the documents.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.360]   I'm using Microsoft Word ever since Chris Peters came down and asked us what we wanted
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.360]   to see in it.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.720]   So I still use the word star diamond in Microsoft Word because I liked the fact that I can navigate
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.160]   without taking my hands off the home row of keys.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.760]   So I still use control X to go down and control Y to go up, et cetera.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.440]   I had to hack it, but it wasn't hard to do.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.080]   A tale of two selfies.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.800]   This is one I really liked is from Mashable.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.000]   One kid, 16 year old Tom White lives in Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.120]   He was walking down the street in Omaha just a couple of days ago and he spotted a couple
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.360]   of very famous people sitting on a bench.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.920]   So instead of asking for an autograph, who was this?
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.400]   Was it you Larry said this is the new form of autograph.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:48.360]   He turns around, takes a selfie with Paul McCartney and Warren Buffett happened to be
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.640]   fitting together, waiting for a bus.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.840]   That is one happy.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.200]   I'm impressed by the way that a 16 year old knew who they were.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.920]   Maybe that was the best part.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.200]   That's the best part, isn't it?
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.200]   What's Paul McCartney doing there with hanging out with you?
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.200]   He was in he's on tour.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.200]   He was in Lincoln.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.200]   Oh, was it?
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.200]   Is it is it the Allen conference?
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:11.160]   Yeah, it was yeah, it was during the the the the sundally who were a conference.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.520]   I think this is a law.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.720]   Okay, it was Omaha.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.720]   Yeah, this is a law.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.480]   This is in the Sun Valley.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.000]   This is something you don't see every day in Omaha.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.760]   Even more so even more random.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.760]   That's awesome.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:31.920]   They apparently just come out after a lengthy evening of dinner and ice cream.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.600]   They were sitting on the bench digesting.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.680]   That happens a lot in Omaha.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.160]   Tom said, wait a minute.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.400]   Now that's the happy one.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.000]   This is one that is a little bit more controversial.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:50.560]   Princess Brianna, Brianna Mitchell from Roanoke, Virginia, took a picture of herself at Auschwitz
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.000]   and posted this on Instagram saying I'm famous, y'all.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.440]   Now she's getting death threats.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:02.880]   People feel like it's maybe I'm trying to find a better image here of it.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.880]   Go to Larry's World dot com.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.080]   Oh, do you have it on Larry's World?
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.240]   Yeah, because you want to defend her, don't you?
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.240]   I defended her.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.560]   I mean, I feel bad for her, but yeah, there she is.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.360]   Let's stop persecuting this girl.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.680]   I mean, look, let's not give her death threats, but maybe her parents should have taught her
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.680]   baby.
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.760]   And her dad, who unfortunately passed away, inspired this because her dad was going to
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.400]   take her to Auschwitz because she had studied it in her history class and she was very interested
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400]   in working.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.400]   She's not a insensitive.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.800]   So she knew where she was and what she was doing.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800]   She knew what she was doing.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.280]   And look, we smile at cameras.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:37.800]   Look, how many pictures do you think there are at the Alamo at Gettysburg?
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   That's true.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.200]   I was going to say, get it.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.200]   Down zero.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.200]   I was at ground zero.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.200]   I saw pictures of people taking pictures.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.200]   Oh, no, there are.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.200]   And we all, but that's true.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.520]   But I mean, when we see people doing selfies at ground zero, I mean, I think a lot of us
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.640]   walk by and discuss.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.160]   And whether it's fair enough, and you make a really good point.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.160]   And I didn't know that cheap had a good understanding of what was there.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.480]   That's what you think is you look at this and go like Justin Bieber writing in the Anne
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:03.960]   Frank guest book.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:05.960]   Right.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   And that's where we go.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.760]   And unfortunately, so many, you know, girls for age act that way without having the historical
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.760]   knowledge.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.960]   Yeah, because they didn't know that the disease.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.960]   They don't go to us with that direction.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:17.960]   They're more funny.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:18.960]   Go.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   They're definitely are.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.440]   But I mean, I think that's good to know.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.280]   I mean, I feel like that's, but that's a problem of social, right?
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.680]   Is the context a lot of times the whole story is lost.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.200]   Is it in the social media world, it is so easy for us to shame people based on a little
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.960]   shade of what we have to judge?
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.520]   And again, I bet you if you were to look through every picture ever taken of me in my
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:42.800]   lifetime, you would probably find picture of me in a battlefield smiling, not on.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.440]   I'm judging you right now, Larry.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:50.400]   I know for a fact that I've had pictures taken of me standing on a little round top and
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.000]   I didn't look like I was being dejected.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   For heaven's sake.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   You're right.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.840]   It was a long time ago.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.560]   But I mean, I agree that this girl hopefully would learn a lesson in other kids who are
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.400]   watching this show because I'm sure millions of teenagers watch Twitter are learning a
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:08.640]   lesson to be careful about what you post in social media.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.840]   But I think we also have to as adults be a little less judgmental, a little more understanding
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:17.720]   and just say, okay, maybe you made a mistake, but let's not.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.720]   Okay.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.400]   So Justin Bieber goes to the Anne Frank House, writes in the guest book.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.640]   So he's a different story.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.640]   She's a regular girl.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.800]   I'm with I'm with Larry on this.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:32.240]   I don't understand why this even blew up and became a viral sensation because she's a
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.240]   minor.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240]   We shouldn't have ever, you know what I mean?
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.240]   Like, kids do things to me.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.240]   I kind of feel weird about that.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:41.400]   Now, Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber is now an adult, but back then he's famous, had a whole
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:47.720]   group of people, he's a little prick and he wrote in the Anne Frank book and was a great
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.720]   girl.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.520]   Hopefully, she would have been a believer.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.920]   Well, to begin with, that's incredibly narcissistic, probably.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.920]   Okay.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.920]   And you know what?
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:00.120]   Just so you know, Jerry, we can blame the Canadian education system for Justin Bieber.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.760]   It's not our fault.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.320]   He was Canadian.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.680]   So socialist, it's because they have free healthcare.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.680]   That's the problem.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:14.480]   I think though, that there is a problem here, which is that the ability to judge quickly
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.240]   and destroy people has never been better.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.880]   And we always have been judgmental.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.240]   I mean, humans are judgmental.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.920]   We're gossiped non-girs.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:27.240]   But the fact that we have social media amplifies us so beyond anything we were able to do
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240]   before.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.920]   I do worry about that.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.800]   And Leo, I bet you you have your share of trolls.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.800]   I know I do.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.280]   And negative things to say about us.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   I've seen them.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.280]   I've seen them when you're trolls.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.280]   What can I say?
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.280]   Nobody trolls Jerry Pournell.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.280]   I'm a fan.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:46.480]   No, well, not true, but you're sure you have to.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.480]   We all do.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.480]   Larry's had the same problem.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.600]   Leo has the same problem.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.600]   I don't know.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.680]   I haven't seen much in Christina, but nobody trolls Christina Warren.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680]   Nobody is.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.480]   Nobody is all that pop.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.480]   Sure does.
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:04.480]   There isn't somebody out there hoping to punch you in the stomach and get a headline
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:05.480]   for doing it.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.480]   Here's the problem.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.880]   So we're all professional journalists and we go out there and put ourselves out.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.880]   We're public figures.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:11.880]   We're public figures.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:15.520]   If you're a kid on Twitter, you're also a public figure, but you're not a public figure,
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   right?
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   You're a North Carolina kid.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.000]   But now millions of people potentially are tuning in on you.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.880]   And suddenly you're being held to the same standards and getting the same kind of ridicule
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.600]   that people like us who kind of knew what we signed up for have to put up with.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:34.520]   You know, Neil Dash wrote a great article on Medium about this very subject.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:42.840]   What is public that it's I'm afraid a little too nuanced probably for most people.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:48.760]   And I'm not sure how to summarize it, but essentially just because Twitter and Facebook
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:54.080]   are public technically, right, doesn't mean that they should be public.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.720]   It's public for instance, and even legal to look in somebody's window as you walk by
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.560]   in the street.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.320]   But more social mores.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.320]   It's a tacky say it's not to be done.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.360]   And the problem is we don't have those mores on Twitter.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.880]   He's blaming the media in some ways for this because they'll take tweets.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.000]   Of course, they're right when they say, hey, that you're tweeting it's public.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.120]   But many things we do that we consider public have by social mores, not being considered
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.120]   public.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:30.560]   He says, for instance, if an addiction recovery group decides to take advantage of summer
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.040]   weather and meet in a park instead of their church basement, you can legally record the
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.640]   conversation and post it with photographs on the internet.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.840]   You could tag the names of their employers, friends and family members, but it would be
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   wrong.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.840]   It would be a get people.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.840]   It would be wrong.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840]   I love it.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.800]   It would be wrong, but it's going to happen.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.000]   Now I love to take pictures of people, but I will not take a picture of a person and do
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.480]   anything with it without their permission.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.640]   And it's not legally required, right?
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:57.640]   About in a public park.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.440]   I see an interesting looking person.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.880]   I'm not unless they're like a performer or something.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.840]   I'm not going to take a picture of them without asking, especially a kid, simply because I
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.840]   think it's wrong.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840]   Legal or not legal.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.880]   And I think Jerry, you would agree with this.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:15.840]   The answer is not to make laws, but to enforce already existing social mores on what is
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:16.840]   private.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.840]   Of course.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:25.480]   Now, I unlike Larry, I do take pictures of people without their permission, but I don't
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   publish them.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.600]   Yeah, that's novelists need something to draw on.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.280]   And every now and then, people will be doing interesting things that will appear at some
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:41.000]   point as an incident in one of my stories, but you won't trace it to that person.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   Right.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.840]   So that's really interesting.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.000]   I'm sorry, a little sidetrack.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.240]   So you will, as part of character research for writing, you will take a picture of somebody
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.880]   and say, I'm going to visualize that person is, let's say, guilders or something like that.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.880]   How interesting.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.480]   Well, I think many novelists do.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.480]   I love that.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.720]   There's a little insight into the process that I love that's fascinating.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.120]   My problem is that I would publish it.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.120]   I publish everything.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.880]   I don't have a private life.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.840]   But praise to, and I recommend people go to Medium and read a Neil Dashes article.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.840]   It's nuanced.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.840]   He is so great.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.040]   And he is a good thinker.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.240]   Yeah, he is.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240]   He is.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240]   What is public?
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.560]   He says is the title of it.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.800]   It's so simple, right?
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:23.800]   But no, it's not.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:30.200]   And I think this is a great discussion that needs to be, we need to have more often.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.840]   Often I think what a lot of people do, and I'll include myself sometimes is say, there
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:39.400]   ought to be a law, but really, you know, not a social norm.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.640]   No social norms are so much more powerful.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.680]   For instance, you have a lock on your front door, but really it's a simple thing to just
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.480]   kick that lock in and wander into your house.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.720]   The lock has the force of, of course, of law, but also the force of social norms.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.880]   You don't do that.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.360]   And I think these are very powerful.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.040]   And I think we ought to remember that and maybe encourage people, you know, there's this
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.400]   whole thing about sex thing and putting kids literally putting them on sex offender registries
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.520]   because technically if you're sexed and you're under 18, it's child pornography.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.600]   But come on, there are good reasons why it's generally a stupid idea.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.280]   But if that shouldn't be a crime, no.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.000]   And the idea that somebody should be punished for it is just absurd.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.640]   Now merely punished, but essentially to be put on a registered sex offender list, which
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.160]   is for a term sign, it's a law.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:36.920]   Larry, I will point out that with regarding the publication of stuff, now I have taken
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:45.160]   pictures at like things like Condex, where people were doing goofy things at both that
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:50.880]   they probably should have been doing and didn't really want everybody to know they were doing.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.320]   And I suppose one of them actually got fired as a result.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.320]   What was he doing?
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.280]   But that's I think fair game.
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.920]   You're in public, you're out in public.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:01.320]   You know you're in public.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.320]   And you're an adult.
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:06.800]   Yeah, I think that's very, I want to know.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.880]   You got fired for what?
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:18.760]   I won't say which one, but it's one of the big outfits that basically like Griffin, but
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.360]   it isn't Griffin.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.240]   They sell accessories for this, that and the other.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:28.080]   And the guy was making some really nasty jokes about his own product.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.080]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it's done.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.680]   And I just didn't think he was doing it not only that, but it was funny.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:38.120]   So I probably won't do it again, but I did it.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.720]   And I was shocked when he was fired for it.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:48.320]   I'm sorry in the sense that I caused that, but I don't feel I've done anything wrong
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.000]   by publishing that picture.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   He was putting on a show for an audience for an audience.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   No, absolutely.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.880]   I've taken pictures of somebody walking in a parade or you go to a festival and they're
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.160]   dressed in a particularly festive manner and you want a picture of them.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.000]   I think it's fine because in a sense they're performing in public anyway, but I wouldn't
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.720]   necessarily take a picture of just somebody standing there or kids sucking their thumb.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.080]   It came up when I was in Cuba and there was this wonderful picture of this old man standing
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.680]   in a doorway and it would have made a great picture.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.960]   And I'm sure I could have taken it.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.080]   He never would have known about it and it would have been fine, but I just kind of felt
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.080]   bad.
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:22.600]   I just felt like I had no right to do that.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.600]   And so I didn't want to do it.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.760]   Well, I think you and I are kind of in agreement about what the mores are.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.760]   Yes.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:33.040]   The real problem and I think we're all very aware of this is that there's, I think this
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:43.480]   is another case of the drive to get clicks over powering people's better angels.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.240]   I think this whole thing, I write for form and they pay by the hit.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.480]   And I don't lie, I profit by that business model.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.560]   I do very well because I get a lot of views, but I hate the idea of it.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:54.560]   I hate the incentive.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.400]   And doesn't it incite you to create clickbait headlines?
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:03.000]   It sent me to think very creatively about my headlines and I try to do it with intent
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.160]   integrity, but I would have to, I would be lying to you if I didn't think about the headlines
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.320]   a lot stronger than I used to think about headlines before I actually got paid for clicks.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.120]   And I just think it's, but of course that's always been true in publishing going back forever,
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.120]   right?
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.120]   Newspaper, you said headlines.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.120]   Well, I mean, okay.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.000]   I mean, Pulitzer in Vinodiella journalism.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000]   I mean, okay, when I made that remark and the Joseph Pulitzer building to a bunch of Columbia
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.040]   J school students at a panel I was on, I got really, really nasty looks, but I'm sorry,
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.640]   I actually knew journalism history, but the appealants are in and you know, hers, you
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.160]   know, that's their entire background was in yellow journalism, was in sensationalism,
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.160]   was in being a tabloid.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:47.840]   But there's a fine line and, and, you know, I don't want to say it's any worse today than
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.080]   it's been before.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:53.000]   What I do think though is that we have more access to regular people because everybody
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.680]   puts things out there that we don't always consider.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.920]   I mean, I've been guilty of it.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.080]   My publication's been guilty of it.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.160]   I think we've all kind of had those moments as we're talking about where you don't necessarily
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.680]   take into account.
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:10.680]   This is what's happening and this is a real person and maybe not someone who understands
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.680]   the significance of what's going on around them.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.200]   But the one good thing, the one only good thing I will say is that, you know, the news
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:23.880]   cycles are so short that you might get a lot of pressure up something like this goes national,
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:28.800]   but in today something else is going to, in most cases, you know, take everyone's attention
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800]   away.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.760]   That's the only good thing.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.200]   And the other thing is if anybody ever says something nasty about you on the web and it
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:40.240]   comes up in Google, all you have to do is be out there big time for another few weeks
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.800]   and that will be so buried that when people Google you, that's going to be hundreds of
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.880]   hits down and you're going to be fine.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:50.040]   So I always tell people the more public you are assuming that most of the things being
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.840]   said about you're positive, the safer you are in terms of your reputation being somehow
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.760]   damaged because of a search engine.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.360]   Well, this conversation is raised two points which I want to get to in just a moment.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:04.920]   One is the right to be forgotten, which is a story going on right now with Google and
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:10.040]   the right in Europe anyway to say, I don't want search results to show up with my name.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:17.640]   And the other is the how a company incense its employees, just as Forbes incense you,
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.960]   can affect the employee's behavior.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:25.640]   Comcast has a little admission it wants to make regarding that customer service call
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.120]   with Ryan Block we talked about last week.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.840]   Boy, that was the call heard round the way.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.480]   Congratulations to Ryan for getting Comcast to think a little bit, but we'll talk about
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480]   that in a second.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:41.440]   I want to talk a little right now about one of our great sponsors Atlassian.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.280]   They make a product called JIRA.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.720]   You know about it, if you are a programmer, you work in a technology environment, you've
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.320]   surely heard of JIRA.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:54.960]   It lets you easily capture and organize your workflow, helps you prioritize, take action
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.720]   on what's important, stay up to date with the activity going on around you.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.160]   What was it we were talking about?
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.160]   Mojang.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.160]   Minecraft.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:06.960]   Yeah, Mojang uses Atlassian JIRA for its Minecraft bugs list.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:16.160]   Yes, in fact I've submitted and checked bugs on this is Mojang's Atlassian account and
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:19.760]   this is public for the, you know, they've set this up to be public.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.920]   And so you can easily see, you know, there's this.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920]   There's the activity list.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.160]   There's an activity list if you jump in here.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.800]   People are doing it in the sponsor.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   Things I like the most.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   It's just broke it.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.800]   No, it's just.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:34.600]   It's just, is that you can merge, you know, if there are duplicate tickets you can merge
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   them together, make sure you track everything, comments, screenshots, even videos of issues
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.440]   are very easy to attach.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.520]   It's a really sweet system.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.760]   Add, browse, check through.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:49.520]   There's just some really great stats throughout all of this.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:50.800]   I don't know how much Mojang is.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:54.880]   I mean, there's so many capabilities you can, they have literally hundreds of JIRA add-ons.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.280]   They could include test management, time tracking, project management.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.640]   It integrates with Git so you can follow your code from development all the way through
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:05.080]   delivery on a single system.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.360]   They use REST API.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:10.560]   So if you don't have a plugin that you want, it's easy enough to create one.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.760]   Very flexible, very simple.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.520]   Used by five-person startups on a hundred thousand-person enterprise.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.160]   It's NASA uses it.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.760]   70% of the Fortune 100 uses it.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.360]   25,000 companies use JIRA from Atlassian.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.360]   And here's the good news.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.360]   It's very affordable.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.200]   Monthly plans started $10 a month for up to 10 users.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:38.160]   And you could try it free for 30 days right now at AtlassianATLAS.com/twit.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.800]   Remember Atlassian.com/twit.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.440]   Try JIRA for free 30 days.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:43.920]   You've been hearing about it.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.720]   I'm sure you are aware of it.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:49.080]   You might want to try it and see how it works in your enterprise.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.520]   Very sweet stuff.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:56.800]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:05.240]   A secret memo leaked by the consumerist from Comcast's chief operating officer regarding
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.400]   Ryan Block's very painful call.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.480]   Dave Watson is the guy who writes this.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:16.120]   He says it was painful to listen to this call.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.040]   And I'm not surprised we've been criticized for it.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.520]   Now this was an internal memo sent to Comcast employees.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.680]   So understand that he's talking not to the public here, but to the Comcast employees.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.080]   Testing our customers is fundamental.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.760]   We fell short in this instance.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.680]   But this is in a way smoking gum.
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:36.000]   The agent on this call, and if you've heard a call, you know the agent was incredibly
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.040]   annoying, did a lot of what we trained him and paid him and thousands of other retention
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.240]   agents to do.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:50.760]   He tried to save a customer and that's important.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:55.560]   The phrase he uses, we make it easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:01.840]   There's another way to say we make it really hard for them not to stay with Comcast.
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:05.680]   The situation, and I hope this is true and not just fluff, the situation has caused us
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.480]   to re-examine how we do some things and make sure that each and every one of us from leadership
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:14.080]   to the front line understands the balance between selling and listening.
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.760]   And then a great sales organization always listens to the customer first and foremost.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.440]   We'll see.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.280]   We shall see.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:26.520]   But it's true companies like Forbes can incent people to do things that in the long run,
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:30.600]   they can see from an abstract something they want, but they may not want the effect of
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:31.600]   it.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.400]   Well, look, in defense of Forbes, publishers have always done that.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:39.240]   The difference is that now individual writers are being incentivized and that's where it
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:41.880]   incentivized and that's where it gets a little strange.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.920]   And I think that those of us who write for any publication that rewards us for hits,
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:52.000]   whether directly or indirectly in this, that's how we get to keep our job, need to exercise
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.240]   some restraint and need to remember that we're journalists first and business people second.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.640]   But the same thing that Forbes invented this.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:02.360]   Yep, with clickbait and outing people and social media and all of that.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.360]   Absolutely.
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.360]   Google has run faster nowadays.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.600]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:11.080]   I was doing bite.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.960]   The circulation was important.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.040]   If you didn't manage to make your numbers, you weren't going anywhere.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.160]   But on the other hand, it took a lot longer to find out whether you were doing it right
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.560]   nowadays, you do something wrong and you're instantly known.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.480]   Leo, I'm going to have to run.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.000]   I'm at Larry's house and it's time to do other things.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000]   All right.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000]   It's been great.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.320]   Jerry, a great pleasure to have you.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320]   We're wrapping up anyway.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.520]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.960]   Jerry Pournell, of course, go to Amazon.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.960]   You'll find all of Jerry and Larry's books there.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.960]   Audible too.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.400]   I love listening to Lucy for his hammer on Audible.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:46.680]   It just came alive in my mind.
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:51.040]   I know maybe that's not quite literate, but that's how I listened and I loved it.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:54.240]   And you got the royalty, so everybody's happy.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.240]   Thanks, Jerry.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:56.240]   Always a pleasure having you on.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.240]   Hi, Jerry.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.240]   And give my best to Larry.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240]   It was great to talk to him.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.240]   All right.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.240]   Take care.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.240]   See you later.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:09.600]   91,000 people have requested removal from Google's search results and they have removed
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.960]   already tens of thousands of links from the European search results.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:21.000]   This is all part of the right to be forgotten privacy regulators require this of Google.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:27.200]   328,000 URLs have been requested to be removed.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.480]   It's kind of unbelievable.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:35.260]   And I fear that this is going to extend beyond European search results that ultimately these
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:39.000]   courts are going to demand, hey, you got these results.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.800]   Those of us in Europe who know that I use.com are going to able to find them.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:43.800]   You get a bit of a rough-reaction.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.400]   Yeah, you got to remove me globally.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.400]   And for me.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:51.720]   As a First Amendment advocate, I'm very concerned about this.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.520]   What I advocate is the right to be forgiven.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:57.760]   I mean, this particular case, some guy had a bank for 15 years ago.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:00.280]   And you could find that out by this is the Spanish guy, right?
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.560]   And you could find that out in Google.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:05.680]   Now, the reality is that we shouldn't judge him because he had a bank receive 15 years
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:06.680]   ago.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.080]   And legally, in most countries, it would have wiped off the books completely from the standpoint
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.440]   of employment or credit, et cetera.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:13.880]   But the reality is it happened.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.960]   It's part of the historical record.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.560]   And does he really have a right to be forgotten if something actually happened?
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:25.240]   I wonder if Google is not just saying, yeah, whatever.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.400]   Let's see how that works out.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.160]   I mean, if I were Google, I would be tempted to say, sure, we'll remove everything.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.560]   Then see what you got.
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:32.560]   See what's left.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.760]   The old Yahoo back in 1988, '98.
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.760]   I mean, that's with the...
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:40.960]   You'd have a human design directory.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:41.960]   Exactly.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.960]   No, totally.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.920]   And then, I mean, to your point, Larry, and with you, as a First Amendment advocate,
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:48.680]   I think this has terrible implications.
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:52.960]   But then beyond that, I also feel like this is such a disenfranchising decision because
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.600]   what it's doing is it's saying that, okay, they don't want to take as big of a step as
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:01.840]   going to the places where it's actually published and saying it's either they need to de-index
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.400]   themselves or they need to remove the items.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.160]   They're going to Google because they clearly are afraid of whatever censorship things are
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.160]   going to be on.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.640]   And they know that they wouldn't have a case there.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.720]   And what they're also not doing is they're going to Google and they're going to Bing
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.640]   and end it to Yahoo, but they're not going to Lexus Nexus.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:18.640]   They're not going to Westlaw.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.240]   They're not going to any of the EBSCO.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:25.400]   They're not going to any of these big pay directories that are going to still have this
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.760]   information that anyone who has money could actually use to go and research something.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.760]   So, to me, it's the ultimate disenfranchising thing, too, because it's meaning that if you
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:42.920]   have money to get into a search database that has access to these documents, you can.
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.800]   But if you're a regular person or if you are someone who doesn't have anything, then you
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.560]   can't have access to this information.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.560]   As someone who's silent, go on.
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:55.160]   When we're saying if somebody's spent the last 20 years running safekids.com and connects
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.160]   safely.org, I think it puts out the wrong message to kids and adults, too.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.960]   It says you can do whatever you want and you have the right to be forgotten.
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.360]   And the reality is that we are responsible for our behavior.
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:09.160]   And as you point out, it really isn't totally forgotten.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.240]   Anyway, it's still there.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.120]   There's still a digital record of it.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:16.320]   Even if you purged it, even if you were successful from the source, there could still be a copy
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.560]   of it that somebody took in a cache.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.600]   And so, the message is not that you should have the right to erase any indiscretion, but
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.600]   you should think before you're posting.
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.600]   You should understand.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.680]   For example, this girl, this girl, this Auschwitz selfie girl, let's say she decides
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:31.880]   that she doesn't want her images found by Google.
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:35.560]   She can do that, but it won't erase the fact they're all over Twitter, they're all over
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.200]   Facebook, and they're forever, ever there.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.600]   No, exactly.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.600]   But to me, when you're talking about something like a bankruptcy or a conviction or whatever
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.280]   the case may be, as you said, these are points of facts.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.440]   These are things that happened.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:53.400]   And to try to remove them, not from the historical record because we can't do that, but from an
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:58.520]   index that is run by a private company that is in another country, in another jurisdiction
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:03.840]   that is not associated with this, that's not hosting the content, that is merely hosting
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:08.880]   that has an index to the hyperlinks, to me, just sets up two worlds of access to information.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:14.960]   The world where people who pay can have access and the world where people can't and I think
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.120]   that's really nasty.
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:19.640]   I think that's a really nasty precedent and that's something that to me hasn't come into
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.640]   this at all, but that's really what it creates.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.080]   It creates two types of access worlds and that's exactly what the web is supposed to
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.240]   get rid of, right?
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:32.920]   So I mean, all the first women stuff, even separate from that, I think just the fact that
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:40.080]   it's creating this dual existence of paradigm things is just really, really troubling and
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.080]   I agree with you.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.080]   I think it had one more thing.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:47.560]   It also puts Google in the business of making editorial decisions and we don't want them
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:48.560]   to do it.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.560]   They're editorial, it's almost like a court, they're going to have to set up a tribunal
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:57.040]   of people who will decide each case on its merits and then you get to be removed, but
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.040]   you don't.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.040]   Google's removed half, about half of the other.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.680]   I had a bad hair day the other day.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.680]   Can I have that?
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:08.720]   I was making this point to someone earlier this week.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.120]   I think one of the biggest issues is that clearly the regulators in this case do not
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.880]   understand the technology involved.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:17.480]   They feel like it's so easy to just remove a link and don't realize that actually there's
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:22.240]   a lot more to it than that and something from search results isn't actually removing anything
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.920]   and I think they're putting this on Google to get rid of things that A) isn't the responsibility
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.400]   even under the guidelines would be.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:34.800]   They think they don't understand how the web works and how hyperlinks at their base level
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.480]   work and so to me it's really, it's sad that this moves so quickly from a judgment into
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.280]   going into effect.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:46.560]   When now they're asking these questions Google has until the 30th to answer and I'm feeling
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:50.320]   like shouldn't these have been questions that should have been asked before a judgment was
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.960]   put into place so you can start thinking about if there is a policy how do we enforce this
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:57.840]   rather than, well, okay, we've made this law.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:02.160]   Now we're going to talk to the company and see how we can enforce it based on whether technical
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.560]   abilities are which we have no idea what they are because we don't understand them.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:09.640]   We just know that this is scary to us and we don't like that when I Google my name someone
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:14.640]   Google bombed me and we're the only things that come up are these things from this period
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.760]   of time and it embarrasses me.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.920]   It's like at a certain point and think, Larry, to your point earlier, the way to kind of
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:25.440]   hide that information is to have more of a presence to have other things going on.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:31.480]   But I think in absence of either that or the right to forgive, the solution isn't to go
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.120]   after the indexer.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.440]   I mean, it just, I don't know.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.440]   Cold thing is really troubling.
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.720]   But you realize this was the equivalent, the European equivalent of the Supreme Court.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:41.200]   This was the highest court on your side.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.640]   No, I know I think it's a done deal.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.680]   But no, I completely understand that and that's what I'm saying.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:51.720]   That's what's so troubling that A, that this decision was decided the way it was without
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:55.880]   any of the technical knowledge and that they are asking these questions, the regulators
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:01.040]   are asking these questions at Google after they've already decided the ruling rather
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.560]   than asking those things beforehand because to me, I feel like that's, it'll be like our
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:08.160]   Supreme Court, I mean, to their credit, they don't do everything right.
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:13.400]   But they bring people in, they bring experts in, they try to learn about the various caveats
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.880]   of what's happening with something before making a decision.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.560]   And in this case, I don't feel like there was any investigation whatsoever done into
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.600]   how Google actually works and how even the basics of how a search engine even works.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.680]   I feel like they went into this with almost no technical knowledge.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:36.640]   Here's a startup, I think the startup of the week, an app for the iPhone called Fixed,
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.560]   the easiest way to fix a parking ticket.
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:44.480]   Now you have to get an invite and it's only San Francisco so far.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.920]   But when you get a ticket, you take a picture of it, you send it to Fixed.
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.960]   First they look through the ticket for technicalities, mistakes, and then if they can't find one,
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.900]   they automatically generate a letter on your behalf to San Francisco saying, "Oh, we can
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:01.080]   test this ticket."
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.680]   And they'll fax it as well.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:10.360]   You pay nothing until the fine is reversed, in which case you pay 25% of the fine to Fixed.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:14.520]   Now I would, as you might imagine, the city of San Francisco isn't terribly happy about
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.080]   this.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.840]   Fixed was mailing and faxing the submission.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.160]   Then the city of San Francisco sent them a letter saying, "You can't fax it."
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.400]   They quoted California State Law which says, "In fact, you can fax it."
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:33.000]   So they unplugged the fax machine.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000]   I don't know if this is going to survive or not, but I think it's...
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.600]   No, I got a parking ticket.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.360]   The day I got my first smartphone with a camera with an LA, I got a parking ticket in Wilshire,
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.360]   Boulevard.
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.600]   I knew I was innocent and I said, "Oh, I've got a camera."
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600]   I took pictures.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.920]   I documented my innocence.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.240]   I appealed to my mail.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.240]   I still lost.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.120]   I had an ironclad case.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.120]   It didn't matter.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:55.120]   Now I could have flown to LA and got...
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.120]   That's what you need to do.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.120]   You need to go to court.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.120]   Exactly.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:01.560]   You have to go to court and see if they show up.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.080]   And then what you're hoping, usually because I've just had it a few times as you hoped
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:09.200]   and the police department ships up.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.120]   They can test your thing.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.120]   In most times they won't.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:15.680]   So if you get lucky and no one's there, then they'll find it in your favor.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:19.000]   But if you were visiting or something, yeah, you're screwed.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]   It's easier to pay a parking ticket.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]   It's easier to pay a $50 parking ticket.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]   In most cases.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.600]   Somebody in the chat was suggested.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   Somebody in the chat was suggested.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.600]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:30.360]   Just flat fee tickets.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.920]   You pay a yearly fee at all.
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:33.920]   It's up with the other.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:37.840]   I like the fact that they're incentivized to win the case.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.800]   You don't pay unless it works.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.200]   I'll use it.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:42.960]   They've got a million to fund.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:45.240]   And the nice thing, Leo, is I don't have to wait long.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.880]   You know, I'm constantly trying to go to San Francisco.
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:47.880]   I get a ticket.
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:48.880]   So it.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.520]   Hey, I really want to thank you for being here.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:54.520]   Of course, Jerry Purnell, who has already taken off Larry Magad.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:55.680]   Larry Magad.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.000]   What is called Larry's World?
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.520]   Larry's World.com has a place to go.
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:04.000]   Find out about all of Larry's efforts with Safer Kids and so forth.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.240]   And of course, you'll hear them on CBS Radio every single day.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:07.240]   It's great to see you again, Larry.
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:08.240]   Thank you for being here.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:09.240]   Good to see you, Leo.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:11.840]   Tina Warren, who is one of my favorite panelists.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:14.320]   And we want to get you back more.
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:15.320]   Mashable Duck.
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.320]   What's your title at Mashable?
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.160]   I'm our senior tech analyst.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.160]   Senior tech analyst at Mashable.com.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.800]   That even had old.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:22.800]   She's already senior.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:23.800]   She's senior.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:26.360]   Boy, if you're senior at 30, what's next?
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.360]   It's all downhill.
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.640]   Jerry Atcher Tech Analyst, if I work here.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.160]   Anyway, great to have you both.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:33.160]   Thank you so much.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.160]   Thank you for being here.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:35.320]   Let me just show you a little bit.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.480]   We had a great week on Twitter.
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.800]   If you missed anything, this is some of what you might have seen.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.720]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.280]   What I'm just shocked.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:47.840]   This is really just like sitting around having a beer talking with friends.
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:48.840]   Tech News today.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:52.640]   Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that the company plans to merge the currently
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:56.960]   separate version of Windows into a single unified version that will run on all devices
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.400]   of all screen sizes.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.920]   When queried about this in the Q&A at the end of the call, he said we will have multiple
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.920]   SKUs for OEMs.
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.800]   We will have multiple SKUs for end users.
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:07.640]   In other words, nothing's changed.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.840]   Security now.
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:11.600]   Microsoft Research published this paper.
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:18.000]   Guardian, their headline was Microsoft recommends against always using strong passwords.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.680]   People were like, what?
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:22.600]   Some sites are not that important.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.600]   This week in Google.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:26.280]   I have just watched all the eight seasons of the Kardashians.
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.280]   Oh, jeez.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:28.280]   You crushed me.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.920]   I did this app is doing so well.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:33.840]   It challenges my notion that these are not smart people.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:35.840]   Quit now with half the calories.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.840]   Look at that cake.
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:40.120]   Happy third anniversary, Brick House.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.320]   We've been here for three years.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.320]   We moved in on July 24, 2011.
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:48.360]   It's been a great home for us and we hope many more years in the Brick House.
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:53.160]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200 UTC.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:55.960]   If you stop by, you will be glad you did.
[01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:58.800]   I promise we can watch live and chat with us in the chat room.
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:01.280]   We even have a room for you to come and visit us in the studio.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:04.600]   If you ever make it up at Aluma Way, just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:06.680]   I thank all of you who came today.
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.560]   It's nice to have a live studio audience.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.560]   But don't worry.
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:13.400]   If you miss a show, you can always get it after the fact we make on-demand audio and video
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:16.200]   always available at twit.tv.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:20.320]   On all the apps, Stitcher, we have our own apps in every platform, including Roku.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:21.680]   There's a great Twit app.
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:25.400]   So please take advantage of those and we want to see you here each and every week.
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:26.400]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.920]   Oh, let's not forget.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.400]   We have the new Brick House T-shirt.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.400]   We had a vote.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:35.000]   It was a close vote, but this is the design that won.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.760]   There are a variety of different ways you can get this.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:39.000]   It will be available for one month only.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.040]   Can you show the back?
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:43.600]   Because we spent a lot of time on the back.
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:44.600]   There it is.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.320]   That's the Twiick Brick House anniversary T-shirt.
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.720]   So I invite you to visit teespring.com/twit.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:56.000]   We have a couple of different styles.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]   There's a woman's tea as well.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.400]   Her colors are white or black.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:03.920]   And I think you'll be very happy with your one of a kind.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:05.600]   We've only sold five.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:11.240]   Oh, this is the first anybody said anything about it.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:12.240]   Okay, that's why.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.200]   Go ahead and buy your Brick House T-shirt to commemorate our third anniversary in the
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.200]   Twiick Brick House.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.200]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.200]   We'll see you next week.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.200]   Another Twit.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.200]   It's a Nakaan.
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:23.200]   Thank you everybody.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:30.200]   [Applause]
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:37.200]   [Music]
