[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.520]   gathered around the Twit virtual fireplace, Chris Perrillo,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   the locker gnome who has now gone Mac.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.160]   Hello, Mr. P.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.040]   Hi. I feel so different.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.200]   You did an unboxing last night, actually Ponzi.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360]   Is this your air or her air?
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.880]   This is her air.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.920]   I'm getting a Mac Pro that's shipping tomorrow, Monday,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.440]   and I'll be doing a live unboxing of that,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.160]   and an installation of 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.440]   Oh, that'll be like calling people.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.040]   They'll have to call it with the motherboard on that.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.240]   Really the 8-way motherboard.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.160]   I'm sorry, are they calling people who use the air
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.880]   and air head like they do Mac head?
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.360]   They should. Some air heads.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360]   Is that?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.800]   The cost alone.

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I'm announcing it.

[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.320]   Yes.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.680]   I'd rather watch her than you, Patrick.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.880]   So, Patrick, are you in a co-host search mode?

[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.600]   Damn that Calicanus.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.520]   Veronica is such a star, and it's really
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.840]   fun to watch her ascend to the heavens.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.880]   I've seen this happen before.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.320]   Every time, in fact, I work with a woman.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720]   They go on to bigger and better things.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.240]   And I say, stuck here in my little gear.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   I think you're doing all right.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.160]   That's my gear.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   But you know, Gina Smith, same thing.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.680]   She started on the remember of that, John?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800]   She took over from you on the radio show.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.960]   And then all of a sudden, she's on Good Morning America,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.480]   and ABC's Tech correspondent.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.960]   And now she's gone back to school.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.400]   She had a baby.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.280]   She's gone back to school.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160]   Why don't you become a CEO in the interim?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.880]   Yeah, you remember that Larry Ehrleson was Think Nick,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.240]   the network computer.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.600]   So the big story of the week, of course, continues to be Yahoo
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.840]   held hostage day eight.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.600]   Microsoft offered $44.6 billion.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.480]   The latest from the Wall Street Journal on Friday,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.720]   the Yahoo board got together via phone and said, no.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.600]   We don't want-- now, this is the interesting thing.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.280]   We don't know what the letter to--
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.520]   will look like to Microsoft.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.960]   That'll probably go out Monday.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.800]   But they leaked to-- somebody leaked.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.160]   Probably the board leaked to the Wall Street Journal
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.400]   that they thought it wasn't enough,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.560]   that they wanted $40 a share, which would have made it
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.120]   a deal for $56 billion.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.360]   So what was the share price before this FURA launched itself?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640]   $20.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.360]   And they offered them a-- what, a huge-- like 61%
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.280]   over the stock value.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.040]   And that wasn't enough.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   They offered $30.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.080]   $30?
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.440]   And so that's 33% more.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.960]   No, 50% more.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.280]   Is this one of those scenes where it's not
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.440]   going to matter what the board wants,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.200]   because the shareholders are going to go berserk?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.040]   Well, that's when I get--
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.880]   The shareholders are going to--
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.720]   I don't know about that.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.280]   That's when it's the barbarians at the gate.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.080]   That's when it's a hostile takeover.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.440]   And look, Microsoft's not going to pay $40 a share.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.800]   So--
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.320]   No.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.640]   How do you know?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   I think it's a stretch for them.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.040]   They're borrowing money already to pay the $44 billion.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.840]   And they're going to have to borrow more money.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.760]   They don't even like borrowing money at all.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.560]   So they're borrowing money to do this deal.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   This deal is not going to happen.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.920]   Or--
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   No, that's a great job.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.320]   And if it does happen, the EU is going to kill it.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.120]   This whole thing is I'm going to take--
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.920]   You see--
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.840]   I agree with you, the EU will never let it happen.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.680]   But Microsoft could, as Patrick implied,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.400]   end around the board and go to the stockholders' shareholders.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.800]   They throw the board out.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.520]   We're giving you 50% on your dollar.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.960]   Well, what's the advantage to--
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.200]   is there any advantage to end users to Microsoft owning Yahoo?
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.480]   Other than it not being Google?
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.000]   I think it's bad for everybody.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.920]   It's bad for Yahoo.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.760]   Google can't do it because they'll be in a monopoly situation.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.280]   So they're not even going to bother.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.800]   Google loves to--
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.440]   And the last thing Google wants is--
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.040]   yeah, last thing Google wants is Yahoo's development practices
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.120]   tainting its own.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.720]   Mike, we try to get Mike on.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.640]   He was going to be on the show, but now we only
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.400]   have his answer machine.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.520]   And we'll be giving out his a cell phone number a little
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.200]   later on in the show.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.720]   Mike points out, and I think quite rightly so--
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.440]   and very interestingly so-- that the Microsoft stock
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.960]   took such a huge hit after this offer.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.760]   It in fact went down the equivalent of $44 billion,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.520]   or something close to it, $38 billion.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.080]   So it's almost exactly the same amount they made the offer for.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.920]   Is that a coincidence?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.760]   So the stock market knows something.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.920]   They didn't like the deal.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   They didn't?
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.400]   Nobody who was-- I mean, Microsoft's already got a bunch
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.080]   of bad-- got a bad rep.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.800]   The stock can't move at all.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.680]   Well, it's ridiculous.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.440]   And in fact, I said I wrote one column.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.480]   Well, actually I wrote one column calculating
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.840]   that this would be $5 per share.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.960]   So anyone who has 100 shares of Microsoft,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.880]   they should have been getting $500 in a dividend rather than
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   throwing money away at some bonehead deal like this.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   That's what I'd be mad at.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   If anybody should be mad, it shouldn't be the Yahoo stockholders.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.040]   It should be the Microsoft guys.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.840]   Microsoft's never paid dividends, have they?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   Yeah, no, they have a little dividend of some sort.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.160]   Oh, they do now.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.920]   Well, yeah, I don't know if they're still paying it,
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.560]   but they had it some time ago.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.880]   I don't remember, I think.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.960]   I mean, here's the other problem is--
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.440]   I may be wrong, but my sense is that there's nobody at Yahoo
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.240]   from the guy on the ground floor to the guy
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.160]   in the executive suite who wants to go to work for Microsoft.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.760]   Yeah, I would say that's probably true.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   So if you--
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.760]   Yeah, but what's going to happen with Yahoo?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.720]   I mean, they're not doing too good right now.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.400]   They're not doing too well.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.760]   Either.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.160]   They're not doing either.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   Good or well.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.960]   Thanks, Dad.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.240]   The adverb is not your friend.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.760]   I just have to remember that.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.800]   So I guess the question is, was this a crazy deal
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.440]   from the beginning?
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.800]   Kringley wrote a really interesting article
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.720]   in which he posited.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   I think I mentioned this last week
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.480]   that the whole thing is basically
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.600]   Microsoft's attempt to become a general electric.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.960]   Could conglomerate of a lot of diverse technology companies
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.760]   so that they can withstand the winds of change.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.160]   Well, I had written a column saying
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.920]   that because of the influence of what's his name, Buffett,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.880]   they think they're going to become a kind of a
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.840]   birchel Hathaway kind of investment group.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.280]   Jimmy Buffett.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.720]   Because they can't do anything else.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.560]   Warren Buffett.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.480]   Oh.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.000]   Warren Buffett.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.040]   I thought maybe--
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   I thought maybe--
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.400]   I didn't compare it heads.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.960]   I didn't buff it.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.440]   I know, no.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.000]   You said Buffett.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.240]   No, you said Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   But it's-- but it's-- I mean, to a certain point,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.640]   Microsoft already is a loose conglomeration
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.000]   of divergent technologies and applications that are pretty
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.360]   much only tied together by links on the desktop
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.400]   and in subsets of Windows.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.920]   I mean, they're already in a lot of pies.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.080]   I mean, if they wanted to be GE,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.040]   shouldn't they invest in something that is not a desktop
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.120]   or that is not something that directly impacts
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.880]   on their existing businesses?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.080]   Is that kind of the whole--
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.480]   Here's the four businesses.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.160]   Ballmer says they're in.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.480]   They're in desktops.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.280]   They're in enterprise.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.360]   They're in entertainment with Xbox and Zoom.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.680]   And they're in online with MSN.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.360]   But what they're not is in cloud computing.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.640]   I mean, live, I guess, sort of.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.960]   Hotmail, yes.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.640]   But they haven't really done well in cloud computing.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.680]   Google's starting to eat their lunch in the office area, right?
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.960]   With the Google suite that's free while they will.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   What?
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.680]   Google's not even having snack after its nap
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.200]   at this point in the office.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.000]   But don't you think that's a threat to them?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.880]   Yeah, OK.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.280]   So offline, so when the Google appliance might
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   percite charge for my--
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.320]   you know what I mean?
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.240]   How many times have we watched-- how many times
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.880]   have we watched desktop applications?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.680]   Like, the big thing.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.080]   Like, now it's Google is doing--
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.560]   I think cloud computing is happening.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.480]   You're saying it's that same old thing--
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.640]   thing client thing.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.840]   Yeah, you're calling it cloud computing, which is kind of like,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.080]   you know, Web 2.0.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.760]   We've got sophisticated forums.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.200]   It's better.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.160]   These are in action.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   We have a new name for it.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.400]   It's better.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   Yeah, so now it's not just--
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.840]   it's not like server client computing.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.560]   It's not-- it's not server hosted applications.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.920]   Now it's cloud computing.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   But wait a minute, Patrick.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.760]   What do you--
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.200]   What do you use for your email, Patrick?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.480]   I use Gmail.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.040]   Cloud computing.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.400]   No.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.800]   More software as a service.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.560]   It's a HTML-based email.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.200]   It's cloud--
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.000]   Software as a service.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.440]   Look, instead of running a desktop email client,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.920]   downloading your mail to your desktop
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.000]   and reading it there, you're doing it all on the net.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.360]   That's--
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.920]   I get most of it, not all of the--
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.320]   That's-- I could hop online in an application on my desktop.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.680]   And I know a fair number of people who actually--
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   I know a shocking number of people use Hotmail.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.840]   Or you use Yahoo!
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.120]   Hotmail and Yannemail are 10 times bigger than Google Mail anyway.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.840]   Wait, what Flickr's doing with photo editing online
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.480]   is going to a cloud computing thing.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.760]   But that's cloud computing, the editing of the photo online.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   I submit the creating--
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.480]   I submit the creating--
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.280]   Not creating--
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.440]   Your download-- I mean, it doesn't matter where you're doing it.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.480]   It's still a big step for a company
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.440]   to go from 500, much less 5,000 or 50,000 seats of an office
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.040]   application to an online application.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   So you don't think that Microsoft's looking at that at all.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.040]   You think they're just looking at the online advertising
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.520]   and search.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   That's what they're--
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.120]   I think they're probably looking at advertising revenue
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.760]   in a way to amortize the investment
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.200]   and to live in some of the other stuff.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.920]   They're probably looking for eyeballs.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.520]   They're probably looking for growth that's
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.200]   going to jerk the stock out of the relatively stable position
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.160]   it's been in, because as John will probably back me up on,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.680]   the whole point of Microsoft's stock
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.760]   was to make up for not paying people a lot of money.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.440]   The idea is you're going to go to work for Microsoft.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.600]   You need to be a millionaire if you stayed there for 10 years.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.840]   They've got to figure out a way to pull more talent than Google.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.480]   Or yeah, Google may in the long run
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.640]   end up eating Microsoft's lunch.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.920]   But they have to be able to pull the best programmers
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.360]   and the most talented managers.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.920]   And they can't do that unless people think they're
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.840]   going to get rich there.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.200]   And it's a different culture, boy.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.560]   I mean, the Yahoo culture is open source based.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.440]   It's not-- they run Linux servers, not Windows servers.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.240]   I mean, Google.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.120]   I mean, Google.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.920]   No, no, Yahoo.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   I'm talking about Yahoo.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   Both of them.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.680]   But that's what I'm saying is that the culture
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.200]   clash between Microsoft and Yahoo is dramatic.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.280]   And I don't think you're going to keep the Yahoo employees happy.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.800]   I mean, you're right.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.280]   They'll have to offer them a lot of money.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   You're also assuming the Yahoo employees are happy now.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.200]   I mean, a lot of them are.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.760]   But a lot of them--
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.040]   Many of them will be unemployed any minute now.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.920]   I think 10% of them weren't.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.400]   I talk to a lot of those guys.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.560]   And they're all very happy.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.520]   They like the company.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.320]   They're a little disappointed in this performance.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.800]   And there is this issue with the nobody
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.240]   knows who there's-- Jim Lauterback was offered a position
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.560]   there, or at least he was trying to get one there at one point.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.840]   I remember him telling me that he couldn't figure out
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.000]   who was reporting to who.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.280]   The place was a mess.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.040]   And then you send that peanut butter memo came out.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.320]   And it sounds to me as though they need a restructuring
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.280]   of some sort, at least maybe at least a minor one for starters.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.560]   Who wrote that peanut butter memo?
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.480]   It wasn't Terry Semmel, was it?
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.960]   No, no.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.720]   It was one of the hot shot executives.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   But some guy you never heard of.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.360]   He said, we're spread too thin like peanut butter on a sandwich.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.920]   And he was right.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.200]   But that started back with broadcast.com.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.720]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.840]   Yahoo is notorious for its slow, plodding, and ineffective
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.160]   acquisitions.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.680]   I don't get its acquisitions at all.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.600]   They're not nimble.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.200]   Microsoft gains no nimbility.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.000]   It just puts another lead boot on.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.520]   Hey, I got to write down that Microsoft gains no nimbility.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.880]   I like it better than a lead boot.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.120]   This is we, you know, we only have one lead, but we need another one.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.960]   I like that.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.400]   Is this the point where we should all openly acknowledge that neither
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.800]   none of us in this podcast could do a better job managing or working
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.760]   in a middle or senior level management job?
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.400]   That's a given.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.640]   We're pundits.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.720]   That's a given.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.200]   I'm just feeling really honest today.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.840]   Maybe the TV called back.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.920]   It's called it's called armchair quarterbacking.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.600]   That's what this show is.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:28.960]   Right.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.680]   But you know, everybody agrees with us.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   It's not as though we don't know what we're talking about.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.720]   I'm not saying we do or don't.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.520]   I'm just I'm just having a moment of being like, I couldn't do any of these jobs.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.560]   So I could.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.040]   I could do it.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.400]   I could run the whole company.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.920]   You could right into the ground.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.120]   But you turned it into a big giant podcast.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.520]   I would.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.920]   I would.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.160]   As a user, I just want the stuff to suck less.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.400]   That's all we're looking for as regular users.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.520]   Some might as well ask you this, Chris, because you've gone Mac.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.240]   Why?
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.720]   What happened?
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.440]   I remember when you said I'm not going to use Vista.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.720]   I'm going to use XP.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.600]   Even XP didn't do it for you?
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.000]   No, that operating systems.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.600]   Well, several years old.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.080]   I don't know.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.320]   There wasn't really a tipping point, so to speak.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.640]   It was just a long series of events that started years ago.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.160]   Certainly, Apple's moved to the Intel platform helped the release of Vista.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   Didn't help.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.520]   I mean, it didn't help Microsoft's, you know, point in all this.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.160]   Yeah, position.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:28.920]   Thank you.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.320]   I'm having a problem with the language this morning, apparently.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.120]   Um, I know the feeling.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   Well, given that it's four in the afternoon, I think you are actually.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.840]   Well, I was taking phone calls late last night.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.680]   I opened up my phone line now and I get all sorts of anyway.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.280]   So you give out your phone and then you have you stream going and you just answer the phone.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.800]   Is that what?
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   Is that the show?
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.880]   Well, I mean, it's not really the show.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.400]   I mean, I do a lot of things, but that's part of it now.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   And you call it.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.560]   I don't know why the light is over.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   The wine bottle is empty.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.560]   Chris is going to take random.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.760]   Also, I might tune into this.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   It's a blast.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   It's an absolute.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.640]   Now, have you figured out how for us to hear that both ends though?
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.840]   Because, you know, how about getting back to the point here?
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.840]   So, okay.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   Okay.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   Sorry, dad.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.200]   Anyway, um, I think a big push.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   I like it.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.880]   With leopard, it really, you know, caused me to take stock in what I was doing, how I
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.160]   was using OS 10 versus how I was using windows, how, what I use for email and, you know,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.920]   contact management has been in outlook.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.840]   I moved to an exchange server.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.240]   So that's all hosted.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.640]   I use plaxo to synchronize between all my points, including Google Calendar, iCal, so
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.840]   on and so forth.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.240]   So then I waited to see what Apple was going to do with the new Mac Pro.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.640]   And then I was, I was just in heaven.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640]   I was like, okay, that's it.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   I'm done.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   You like eight windows in a machine.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.640]   That was it.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.520]   I would be, I would be really curious to see how the new Mac Pros hold up because I had
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.280]   a couple of the early, or I should say MacBook Pro.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.120]   You have the Mac, are you going for the Mac Pro or the MacBook Pro?
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.680]   I've got a MacBook Pro, the 17 inch 1920 by 1200 yadda yadda.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   I never use mine.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   It's too big.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   It's like a pizza box.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.320]   Oh, no, I'll take the size for the speed any day and the resolution.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.720]   I can't beat it, but no, a Mac Pro is what I'm talking about.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   Patrick, the tower.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   He wants it.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   He's got an hour.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   No, that's, that should be pretty stable.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   Those are great.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.880]   I've got a Zion for, it was almost a year and a half.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.880]   I love it.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   I mean, it's a rock solid machine.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.520]   Well, I'm just ready to use more than two gigs of RAM.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.600]   And you know, quite honestly, I could go with Windows 64, but unless I'm doing video editing
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.080]   or audio editing in a 64 bit app, it's relatively useless.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   Right.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.280]   This is what Windows says in two gigs.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.040]   I'm trying to think, but nothing happens.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.320]   I just, that's for you, John.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.840]   John's new show is the sound effect show.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:02.280]   Now instead of a MacBook Air, had you bought Ponzi, a red Zoom 80, a Valentine's Day Zoom,
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.400]   you might have got that for free.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.920]   Microsoft can't get them out fast enough, but believe it or not, to people who ordered
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.280]   the Zoom expecting it would come by February 14th, Microsoft has sent out messages saying,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.920]   we wanted to provide you an update on your order status due to some issues and fulfillment.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.320]   We may not get that zoom to you by Valentine's.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:27.200]   We're working to get as fast as we can, but just in case in order to provide a smooth
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.000]   customer experience, we're going to refund the entire amount of your order and we're
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.440]   still going to send you the zone.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.600]   Yeah, but you still wouldn't use it.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   Oh, that's it.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.440]   Yeah, you're still stuck with a zoom.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.240]   Actually, the zoom is pretty good.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.480]   I think I'm going to order one now.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.360]   No, you can't really say I want it by Valentine's.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.320]   Well, I have a zoom, I did the iPod zoom sex video.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.160]   It's got like millions of hits on YouTube.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.760]   And that's really the only time I used it.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.560]   What is the iPod zoom?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.560]   Oh, don't ask him.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.760]   He's going to Google it now.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.080]   Okay, you know what I could do?
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.160]   And if Danes sitting right here and I have to ask Danes permission, but I could play the
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.320]   Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Muppet version of the casino movie, but they'd have to
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.120]   bleep like three quarters of it, Dan.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.120]   You're willing to do that?
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   Yeah, you also have to watch it.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.120]   It's not something to listen to because it's just a.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   Oh, you're right.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120]   It would sound just like the movie.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.120]   Why don't you post the one?
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.720]   Tell everybody the link in there.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   I'll put the link in there.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.840]   Just Google YouTube De Niro and you'll find it.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   There's a lot of.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.080]   Yeah, I'll put it on devore.org/blog.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.080]   It's good for the blog.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.640]   Listen, every take a moment, run and grab a peanut butter sandwich.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.560]   Watch that video and then rejoin us.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.200]   We'll be back in a moment.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   Okay.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   Now, let me understand.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   Do we have to stop now for a couple of minutes or we can keep going?
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   For what?
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   I guess we stopped.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   Okay.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   Welcome back.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.680]   I hope you enjoyed that peanut butter sandwich and De Niro and Pesci.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   And now on with the show.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   This is like working with Ernie Kovacs, man.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   We're breaking new role.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   We're like breaking.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.960]   This is break barriers in the medium.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.160]   We're inventing crap even as we speak.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.560]   Or at least we're making crap.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.560]   There you go.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.040]   Let me see other big stories.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   Yes, there's quite a few.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.160]   50th Grammy Awards tonight.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.920]   No writers, but who needs writers when you've got YouTube?
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.560]   You thought Stuart was having a rock.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.360]   I can't wait to see this.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.560]   Kid Rock go up on the stage, look for the property and they go, "Now what?"
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.680]   Actually, Kid Rock, I think Kid Rock can probably carry it all the way through it.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   You can add Lib is way through it.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.440]   You're talking about somebody who performs on a regular basis in front of thousands of
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440]   people.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.240]   You know, he'll do fine.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   All right.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.560]   But this is the deal they did with YouTube, which I think is kind of clever.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:54.520]   YouTube had a channel that they asked people, the channel is youtube.com/mygrammymoment,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.760]   which sounds like French kissing with your grandma or something.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.920]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.240]   Anyway, my Grammy moment, it doesn't sound, there's something wrong there.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   I'm somewhere with you.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.440]   You've been thinking that.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   My Grammy moment.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   Oh, I know why.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.920]   It's because we were listening to that Star Trek thing before we started.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   Okay.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   Got me in the mood.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.160]   So, YouTube asked it's, I don't know what you call contributors.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   Is that what you call these guys?
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.280]   People who make the videos, they said, here's the Foo Fighters, the pretender.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.400]   We want an instrumental version of it.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.280]   And we're going to put it all on this site, my Grammy moment.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.480]   And people will vote.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   I'm sorry, Chris.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   Like, you know, it's you.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.480]   It's your fault.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   And people will vote on it.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.400]   And then the top 15, this is amazing whether they're playing violin, cello, trumpet, there's
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.520]   actually a trumpet version of the Foo Fighters, the pretender.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.680]   They're at the Grammys tonight.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.240]   They've been practicing for the last two weeks to play together.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   Yeah, brother.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   With my Grammy.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   With my Grammy.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.440]   You want to hear the trumpet one?
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   I think I have it here.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.000]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.760]   Chocolate rain for the wind.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.080]   Chocolate rain.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.840]   Every time I sing chocolate rain, I feel a thousand angels die.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.360]   So let me see.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   That's okay.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   Here we go.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.640]   This is the my Grammy moment guy on the trumpet playing the pretender.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.680]   Let's take a little gander.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.160]   Next.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.400]   Let's see.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:32.800]   This is Lisa on her violin.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.360]   She's good.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   That's good.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.040]   This is also topless, which helps.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.000]   This is cello.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.280]   Remember that with that?
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   The whole movement with topless cellists, I don't know what that was.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   I think that was.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   You know, I missed that.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.800]   You missed that or you miss it.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.280]   You didn't miss it.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   You missed it.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   We need this more bottomless male cellists.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.440]   No, I don't like you.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   No.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.640]   Back to Star Trek.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   Let me see here.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.480]   Okay, on gravel.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.880]   Oh, get this one.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:16.120]   A British travel company which owns the website cruz.co.uk wanted cruises.co.uk.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.960]   They paid $1.1 million for the S. Wow.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   That's more than.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   It sounds to me.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.560]   That's more than a wheel of fortune.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   Cruises are bank.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.120]   I mean, that's their bank.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.400]   But yeah, but they already own cruz.co.uk.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.200]   Doesn't matter if they're.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.440]   If the SEO doesn't work for cruz.co.uk.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.160]   But if people normally.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.600]   It sounds like a waste of money.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   Well, no, if they're typing in keywords and it's a domain that's, you know, cruises versus
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.200]   cruises, maybe people in research were typing in cruises instead of cruises.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   It makes sense to me.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.600]   I understand what you're saying except for the fact that a million dollars would have
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.800]   to amount to at least a minimum of $10 million in sales to make up for the fact that that
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   would be the product.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   That's a long.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   It's a long term investment.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   It's a long term.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   That could be there.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   That could be six months of sales for them.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.040]   It depends on how much they own.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.480]   If they're doing a lot of business, John.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.040]   You know, I can tell you it should be on top of the business they're already doing.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   Cruises are bank.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.380]   They're going to do $10 million in addition to what they're already doing just by having
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.380]   that extra domain.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.120]   Let's find out if they're a publicly traded company.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   So.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.120]   All right.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   You guys carry on.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.120]   I'm going to research this.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.160]   I want to give you this is gets quiz time on the show.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:37.960]   What technology that was so big, so big for so many years went out of business went away.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   I'll tell you what.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   Oh, all right.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.800]   I was going to play the song and give you a tear too fast.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   All right.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   Listen to this.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   See if you recognize this.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:53.040]   Hey, it's an audio daily double.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.680]   It gives it away with the word.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   All right.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.600]   It's not hard.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.320]   How much did the Swinger cost?
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   Remember swing it up?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   1995.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   Very good.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   John C. Devorak for the win.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.080]   Very, very good.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:15.240]   It was the according to PC world, the 43rd greatest gadget of the last 50 years, the
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   Polaroid Swinger in 1965.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   It's kind of sad.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.720]   I mean, I think Polaroid was a great name at 1.21,000 employees.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.280]   They're down now to 150.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   They will phase out the field.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.200]   They phased out the cameras last year.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.080]   They'll phase out the film next year.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.640]   And then I understand they're going to make a bid for Yahoo at some point.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.080]   So the, I'm taking bets that somebody's going to pick up the patents for the film because
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.520]   there's just too many of those old cameras out there left that people want to buy film
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   for.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   Don't don't pro photographers still a lot of times use a Polaroid back to test the setup.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.760]   What are they going to do?
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.320]   I did actually need more and more of them are using digital disusing the digital.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.000]   They have they have a monitor.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.360]   They picture and then they look at them.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.760]   It's a big picture, big monitor, not just a little back of the camera.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.760]   And that's what they're using.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   Oh, you're right.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.760]   They're right.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   Things dead.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   You're right.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   I was just trying to save them.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   But that wasn't sustaining the company anyway.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.880]   It was, you know, these gimmicky little cameras.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.120]   Three brands of knockoff.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.440]   I just remember seeing Polaroids putting up on DVD players and VHS players and stuff
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.160]   a while ago and just being like, Oh, that's a bad sign.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.600]   That's because they went well, that's because they actually the company.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.240]   I think when in the chapter 11 and half of them was bought out and went this way and
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.960]   that way and then they started licensing the name Polaroid so you could buy a license
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.760]   to use the name on a camera and if it wasn't a Polaroid.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.960]   There but for the grace of God.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.640]   Now I can really say this there, but for the grace of God goes Kodak.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:47.200]   I mean, it's kind of impressive how Kodak saved turned on a dime and became a digital
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   company.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.400]   And Polaroid just couldn't do it.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   Yeah, lucky.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   Well, I don't know.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.800]   I mean, I think they're still fighting it because, you know, there's still the old timers
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   at the place.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.520]   I meet with Kodak quite a bit and they're always, you know, there's still a bunch of guys there
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.680]   that still, you know, film, you know, still looking.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.280]   Film is king.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   Well, but that'll still serve a niche market.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.800]   I mean, film.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.520]   Oh, same people buy vinyl albums.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.760]   It's still going to be around.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   It's legacy.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   It's here for here.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   It's here to stay.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.960]   It's just the, you know, how much is it worth?
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.880]   So Kodak went when they got, I think what saved him is that they got into the sensor business
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   really fast.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.440]   And I think their cheap little cameras are probably as good as anybody.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.760]   Their point shoots are very good.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   I think they're not bad at all.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.240]   And they have a brand name and, you know, I think they, they bought a photo remember.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.920]   I mean, so they immediately had an online developing and presence.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.400]   And I think they kind of got it.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.960]   And they, they, they were a company.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.640]   A lot of people thought they're gone.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   They're history.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.040]   Well, they're still struggling.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:52.080]   I mean, it's not all over, but let's see here.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.680]   Tom score says 10 billion videos viewed online in the month of December.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   Massive growth.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   Geez.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   10 billion videos.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   I was a judge that it was that's over a hundred percent growth over last year, I think.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   Huge.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   That's not ridiculous.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   That's reality.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.480]   Yeah, ridiculous reality.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480]   It's amazing.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   It's not ridiculous.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.520]   It's ridiculous that there's 10 billion views of cats playing the piano.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   Give me a break.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.680]   I love that video.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.880]   Oh, come on.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   It's more than that.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.280]   We just play three YouTube videos in this show alone.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.800]   It's, it's big.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   It's bigger than television.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.560]   How many videos do they say during the, during the month?
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.280]   10 billion Google sites, which I, you know, mostly is YouTube, but I guess Google video
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:48.320]   accounts had three billion views, 32 percent market share, Fox interactive media, AKA, MySpace,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.200]   358 million, one tenth the number.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.040]   I mean, YouTube is totally dominant.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.720]   Yahoo third place, the 340 million, Viacom, which I guess, I don't know what Nick at night,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   MTV 237,000 HBO.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.200]   No, is it Viacom HBO?
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.160]   Viacom's Nick and MTV HBO now comedy central.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   That's what it is.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   Weatherload.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   Yep.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.160]   Bingo.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.400]   Well, Reverend, I don't know if you got guys caught this, but Reverend is on the, on the
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.400]   block.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   Really?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.760]   And whoever is going to buy it, it's going to incur a million in debt right up front.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   Ooh, ow.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.600]   I'm assuming someone buys it.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   Right.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.720]   That's the problem with these is the bandwidth consumption's got to be, you know, through
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.880]   the roof.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.480]   Well, you know, for independent publishing and well consumption.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.640]   Yeah, but look at, I mean, how much?
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.120]   Okay, 10, what was it?
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.120]   3 billion videos viewed on YouTube this month.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.480]   How much bandwidth is that and how much revenue do they get from advertising?
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:51.200]   Well, it may not for, for somebody, for somebody like YouTube, which is Google, who is essentially,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.480]   you know, essentially is appearing ISP, right?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.960]   They, they have ways of managing their bandwidth.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   Right.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.800]   You know, it's a lot of, if I'm explaining how that works, explain how that works as a
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   peer.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.600]   Well, traditionally, right, the bad of them, you know, the major backbones, the big ISP,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.960]   whatever you want to call the internet service providers, you know, they kind of meet it
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.040]   up somewhere like Equinix, for example.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.120]   And they exchange packets going to other parts of the Internet.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.280]   So they do that free at that level.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.560]   Just because it's, otherwise they're sucking too much.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.440]   So for instance, if you're AOL, I think this is one of the reasons AOL provides us with
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   so much bandwidth.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.040]   I mean, they give us a terabyte a day.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.040]   Right.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   At least.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.480]   And, but if you're AOL, if you're using everybody, all your customers are using everybody's
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.320]   bandwidth, boom, boom, boom.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.680]   The only way you can kind of even that out is by having other people draw bandwidth from
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   you.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.280]   Well, I don't know if that's a peering relationship.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.640]   So you'd make with the level one, you'd make a peering deal that you say, look, we won't
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.840]   charge you for your bandwidth if you don't charge us for our bandwidth.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.680]   I think that's essentially what's going on.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.200]   I mean, once you, once you get to a certain size, everybody kind of swaps packets for
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   free.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   Right.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.560]   And, you know, if I'm getting that wrong, by all means, you know, I think that's right.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   I think that's right.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   Uh-uh.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.360]   Jay Adelson told us went back when he was still at Equinix.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.320]   Well, Equinix was founded to foster basically free and equal places with gigantic amounts
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:20.280]   of bandwidth and connectivity to allow those exchanges to take place between, you know,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   huge ISPs and backbones and all that.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   Well, thank God.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.720]   Cause this, I couldn't do it.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.040]   If it weren't for these deals, cause if, if it, if AOL and cash fly didn't give us the
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.920]   bandwidth, it'd be 30 or 40,000 a month.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.240]   Uh, a non-trivial expenditure.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   Yes.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   I mean, the donations are good.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.640]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.080]   And let's not forget the great support we get from folks like, let's say, I don't know,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   audible.com.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   Nice segue.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.920]   I do want to thank audible.com.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.400]   Their support really does make a big difference.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.760]   We really appreciate having them on all the shows on the network, including this one.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   Audible podcast.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760]   They have a new URL.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   Make a note of this.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.600]   Are URL has changed?
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.320]   Please listen closely.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   Audiblepodcast.com/twit.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.000]   Audible podcast.com/twit.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.200]   And why do you go there?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.520]   Because if you go there, you could sign up for Audible and get a coupon, a credit toward
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   a book.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   Now they have a lot of choices.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.560]   And that's the thing about Audible.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.360]   Sometimes you go there and you go, wow, what, what do I listen to next?
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.440]   And one of the things I've really noticed with Audible users is whenever we get together,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.840]   very common, every time I meet somebody, when we were in Egypt, Steve Levin, who runs
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.280]   Levenger, the Levenger catalog for readers, Audible listeners.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.560]   So we were like, what do you like?
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   What did you listen to?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.680]   It's inevitable whenever I see friends who are Audible fans.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.600]   They say, well, what's good?
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   And we're always looking for books.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.440]   So that's one of the reasons that we do recommend titles on the shows here.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.320]   Do you guys, do you, Chris Proulault, I've never asked you.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.520]   Do you ever listen to audiobooks?
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.840]   Yeah, I just listened to one last week.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:05.440]   The author was, well, he had a pseudonym, pen name, but I believe his real name was Theodore
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.520]   Geisel Giesel, a book called "The Cat in the Hat."
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   Love that.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   Yeah, it was...
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   It's a very short book.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:18.800]   Well, it took me a couple of weeks to get through it, but once I got into it, I really
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   couldn't put it down.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's why, yeah, it didn't end very well.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   But then at the end, there was like this twist.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.640]   It was pretty exciting, wasn't it?
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.560]   It was very Deus Ex machina.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   Roller coaster ride there.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.720]   Yeah, poor Dick and Sally.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   Oh, man.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   You had to feel for them.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   I did.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   I really did.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.840]   And the fish, I mean, come on.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.080]   Let's listen to a little bit of the cat in the hat.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.480]   This is what makes it something went bump.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   So exciting.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.240]   How the bump made us jump.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.240]   We looked.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.680]   This is Chris's pick.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.920]   He's got the end on the mat for the audio book of the week.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   And we saw it.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.200]   Kelsey Grammer reading the cat in the hat.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.280]   Yes, it's Dr. Seuss, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.080]   Actually I don't recommend using your coupon for this because it's only $2.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.240]   But you could if you wanted to.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.400]   They actually have a lot of kids.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.960]   Chris, remind me, did you just have a baby?
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   Who had a baby here?
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.640]   I didn't have a baby.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.960]   I had a baby.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.760]   Oh, Patrick, you had a baby.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.000]   Now you probably...
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.760]   Seamus is four months, so you're probably not reading a lot to him yet.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   Or are you?
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.080]   I'm never reading a lot to him.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:25.520]   Sarah's been working through the Hobbit and then she's going to start in the movie.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.160]   And I've been reading a lot of Raymond Chandler and some other of my personal favorites.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.080]   I find the one-year-olds really liked it in noir genre.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   Myself.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   He loves it.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.520]   She's a big fan of Black Flag too, which I think has just been a real...
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.320]   In the vlogging mollies, I'm sure.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.040]   Well, he gets his bounce and going.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.520]   You should see him going a bouncy seat man.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.880]   It's awe-inspiring.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.560]   I got into Vonnegut right around the age of two.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.800]   Well, Vonnegut is for the younger set, frankly.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.400]   I've always thought of him as a juvenile, as a children's author.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.360]   Anyway, as you're...
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.520]   Seamus gets a little bit older.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.680]   Bailing out to good idea.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.640]   There are a lot of great kids' books.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.240]   Lion the Witch in the Wardrobe.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.240]   Wonderful.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.400]   In fact, the Prince Caspian's coming out as a movie you should read at first, really.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.880]   Don't go see the movie without reading the book.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   That's available and audible too.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.280]   In fact, I'm going to make that my pick.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.040]   Those C.S. Lewis novels are great.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.680]   I always liked the Magicians and nephew out of the whole Chronicle series.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   Really?
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.360]   My favorite always was.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   Which one is that?
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   Is that the fourth one?
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   The fourth one?
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.600]   I can't remember where it fits in the series, but essentially it's kind of like the prequel
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.840]   book that explains how Narnia was created.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   Oh, see, I have to read that one.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   That's fantastic.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   I love that book.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   They have them all.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   The Magicians and nephew.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840]   Let me see who that's read by.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   Oh, this is neat.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.200]   It's dramatized on here.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.440]   And the publishers focus on the family.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.880]   That makes sense.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.280]   So if you are interested in audiobooks, whether for grownups, they've got Raymond
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.120]   Chandler, they've got all the great stuff.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.080]   45,000 plus titles.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.280]   Audiblepodcast.com/twitweethanger for their support.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   It's so much.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   I really love.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   You know what?
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.080]   You're going to mock me.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.680]   But one of the best things I ever read on Audible is also from C.S. Lewis.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.520]   It's something, you know, he was a Christian.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   It came to it later in life.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.320]   At an Audible or you listen to it.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.280]   I say read, but to me it's like reading.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.480]   But John Cleese reads the Screw Tape letters.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.880]   You probably know the Screw Tape letters.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   Yes.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.680]   Wonderful.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:26.280]   And I have to say I am far from religious, but I just love it.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:35.000]   What it is is it's a series of letters from the devil to his nephew, Wormwood, and telling
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.200]   him how to tempt humans, how to get humans to really screw up.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.760]   And it's wonderful.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.680]   And if John Cleese makes it just come alive, the Screw Tape, actually I'm going to make
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.680]   that my recommendation.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.080]   So thanks for reminding me.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.880]   That's such a good book.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.880]   Sounds like something like a Nixon autobiography, the Screw Tape.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.880]   It just doesn't it.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.880]   Let me play.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.160]   I guess you just got a little listen.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.880]   The little John Cleese is the devil.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:04.280]   And he's drawing his attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.480]   Your business is to fix his attention on the stream.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.360]   Teach him to call it real life.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.520]   You would like this Patrick.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.400]   It has your kind of wicked sense of humor.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   Evil.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   Evil.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.680]   Anyway, did you ever hear of Cleese's eulogy for Graham Chapman's funeral?
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.680]   Oh no.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.960]   Is that what could we get that?
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.640]   It well on YouTube, but it was both sad and hilarious at the same time.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.440]   And I it was amazing, amazing breathtaking.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.920]   Yeah, it's I guarantee it's on YouTube or it's out on the internet because that's how
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   I just found it.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.720]   I am such a John Cleese fan.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.920]   I interviewed him many moons ago when a fish called Wanda came out and spent an hour with
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.560]   him and and I was I'll never forget it because at the beginning, I started asking questions
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   about comedy.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   He said, look, I could tell you how comedy works.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.280]   I could tell you all in great detail the mechanics underlying it, but you don't want
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   me to do that.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   Do you?
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   And I said, yes, I do.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:07.120]   And we spent an hour and this man had clearly made a study, you know, like a scholarly study
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.680]   of what makes people laugh and he communicated it so beautifully.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.040]   I wish I could get it on tape.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   Of course not.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.760]   No, but there's I think A&E is coming out with a special on the history of jokes and
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   supposed to buy.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.760]   Oh, that would be good.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.320]   I just caught a commercial for that the other day, but I can't remember now.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.000]   Anyway, well, while you're on the topic of jokes, you may ever people should go catch
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.960]   the the Gilbert Godfrey dirty jokes session that's on HBO.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.440]   Is this like the aristocrats?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.640]   Well, the aristocrats is the joke he finishes with.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.600]   That's the one that's that's a movie about one joke that he's on.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.480]   But the joke is in there.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.880]   It's basically just an exposition of just about every crap he does.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.120]   But is it him all the way through or their other comics?
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.760]   No, no, just him doing a whole set one hour set of dirty jokes.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.720]   I can't listen to Gilbert Godfrey for more than a minute.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.400]   He's actually pretty funny here because he goes into other voices.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.000]   And he's always like, he's always like, really intense and I can't damn it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Does anybody know that?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.360]   He actually does a Seinfeld that is quite amazing.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.800]   And he does a very good Bill Cosby, which is really funny when he tells a dirty joke and
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.440]   that voice.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   Is that HBO?
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440]   When was it?
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   It's on HBO.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.720]   It's been playing for the last month or so on and off.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   Let's see.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.520]   Pirate Bay dot.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.200]   No, you torrent dot com.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   You torrent.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.160]   Why are you torrent dot com?
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.520]   No, I don't mean to, you know, I'm not encouraging pirates here.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   Anything.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   I use it for Linux distros.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.520]   Right.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.600]   That's what I use BitTorrent to for as well.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.480]   So what do you go to download and you download it?
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   Oh, that's right.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   And you search.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   I've seen this in action.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.480]   I don't have it.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   What you torrent.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.800]   I don't know why why are you torn is a great new search site that is good.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   I mean, amazing.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   It's not a site though.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   It's a it's a program.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.200]   Do you hit it from what?
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.840]   No, from a show.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.680]   It's a good time to torrent comparison search engine.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.280]   Not a new torrent.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.600]   Not new torrent.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   Why are you torrent dot com?
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.000]   Like does it run in a browser?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   How's it worse?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   It's a web.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.600]   Yeah, I didn't you hear about that Chris?
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   What's that?
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.080]   This is an FBI site.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   Is it really?
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.720]   No, they did an excellent job.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.120]   You know, wait a minute, guys, in their tracks.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Don't you know who knows who knows it could be.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.080]   They've done that.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.960]   I'd like to apologize to everyone at Utah and assuming didn't if put do that didn't
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.320]   say that if it was it could be a Kafka and ask a kind of thing you did.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.680]   So what's the name of that?
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.120]   What's that name of that God free to well, let's see, I'll do God free just a Gilbert
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.640]   God free dirty joke.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   Dirty jokes.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.200]   You know, most people don't go out of their way to not only record themselves.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.320]   You know, oh yeah, look at it.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.080]   It's only 349 megabytes.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   Not bad.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.280]   Yeah, that's easy to get.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.480]   Or should I get the I'll get the HD version.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.360]   Well, now here's a question for you Leo.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   Here's a question.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.360]   I've got Comcast.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   I've got a subscription.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.520]   I pay for HBO Cinemax the whole kit and kaboodle minus the sports package.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.960]   Why am I not justified in watching the content that ever repaid for in another way?
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.600]   Why would someone not be just that in that medium?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.000]   Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.560]   Is it the medium or is the content?
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.280]   The Patrick is giving you the line that HBO would give you and that any content.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   I'm giving them the line.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.960]   The cable company would give them even get an update HBO at this point.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.240]   And then but I agree with you Chris.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.480]   You paid for, you know, you own the content because you paid for it.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   It's no different than you.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.760]   No, but I don't own the content.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   I don't know.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   No, I don't know.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.960]   You've purchased the right to watch that content distributed through their system.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.880]   But I can do the art.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.000]   Well, on there you are.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.080]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.080]   They don't really like you.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.080]   Okay.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.520]   So then the Tivo or sling box.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.280]   I mean, the idea that I'm paying.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.840]   You need to grab a lawyer and have the lawyer read through the terms of agreement and see
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   what they've agreed to.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.600]   Well, at some point the cable companies are just going to well, they're not going to
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.320]   disappear, but the cable company and these content providers are just going to find
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.720]   themselves in the same position than the music industry's found itself in.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   Yeah, guess what?
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   That's why they hear stuff like this.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.880]   No, but no, but I was on a panel with the scary.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:19.480]   I mean, I was on a panel with the president of the cable television association and the
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.560]   guy that basically runs NBC interactive.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.240]   I mean, talk about feeling like he brought a pen knife to a gunfight.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.960]   But one of the things that they're saying is certainly NBC is going that has basically
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.520]   looked at what happened to the music industry and decided that they're not going to go
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.040]   out that way.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.520]   So they're working at Hulu.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.120]   They're working at other distribution and sales mechanisms.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.560]   And they're specifically looking for ways to deliver high quality content.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.880]   I sound like such a PR guy at the moment.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.840]   Patrick, you're such a tool.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   You're a tool.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   Such a tool.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.520]   I'm a tool of the man, but I mean, it's interesting to watch them look around.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.960]   It's interesting to watch them look around and go, okay, obviously this didn't work so
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:02.080]   well for the big record companies who are now after a long drawn out nasty fight with
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.160]   their users starting to give away the stuff for free anyway, or at least get, you know,
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.720]   sell the stuff unprotected.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.360]   Now, not every, not all of the, you know, maybe not everybody makes video, but I think
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.880]   the, you know, and the movie studios are going to be interesting to watch, but certainly
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.480]   the television networks are approaching this with a much more open mind.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   They have to.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.280]   Well, but the look at that.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.520]   NBC did with Hulu.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.000]   I mean, what they did was they pulled it off YouTube where it was widely where I think
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.200]   it was a great PR venue for them and they put up Hulu, which nobody's going to use.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.400]   Well, let's say that.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.600]   Hulu is okay, but I mean, it's no, it's good, but you have to sit in front of your computer
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.160]   to do it and I don't know.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.680]   Well, then, well, look at where Apple TV is going.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.160]   I mean, yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.440]   NBC, not just YouTube and BC pull it off iTunes.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.080]   And they said, no, you have to watch it on Hulu.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.520]   Well, I'm sorry, dudes.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   That's I'm not going to.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.840]   And the thing they have to remember is there's always the alternative to download it illegally
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   in high death.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.600]   Yeah, it'll be what you're doing right now.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.480]   I'm going to actually tell you the truth.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.320]   I never do torrents because you can torrents are not impersonal.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   It's easy.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.960]   It's trivial to figure out who downloaded what a torrent is.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.320]   What if you go through a tour network?
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.520]   Yeah, you'd have to go through a tour network and you get it at 1K per second.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.520]   A few later.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.360]   You can't I would never do a torrent from anywhere where I'm attached to that IP address because
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.560]   that's basically public downloading.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.440]   Well, why don't you do what I do, Leo?
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.440]   What's that?
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.000]   I go to people's houses, ask them, like you use a computer for a second.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.520]   I talked to somebody who said every time I come to Canada, I download movies because
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.920]   A, I'm in a hotel, B, I'm in Canada.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   So wait, wait, Devorak, are you saying you're a pulling a rain man knocking on the door and
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   saying, "Wopner's on, Wopner."
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   I don't want to.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   Time for Wopner.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   Download Wopner.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   Definitely Wopner.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   Definitely Wopner.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.320]   No, it's not what I'm saying, but it's just you're slightly abusing.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.320]   It's a little bit shit.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.520]   No, but you could do that.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.880]   And that's one reason not to have, by the way, an open Wi-Fi access point because that's
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.520]   exactly what I would do if I were going to steal movies is do it from somebody's open
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.400]   access point.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.320]   And by the way, that's why I keep an open access point so that when they do knock on
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   the door, I was like, "Well, it wasn't me.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   It was that guy."
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.560]   It was Dean.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.120]   And then they look at the what's on your on your on your on your.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   Hey, Mac.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   It's on your ethernet card.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   They go, "Yeah, that guy LePort.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   That was so good."
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.640]   You can spoof the Mac address.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.600]   Well, is he spoofing the Mac address?
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.360]   Are you spoofing the Mac address?
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.920]   Are you sick of the download movies?
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   I don't care.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   I watch enough TV.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.280]   I mean, there's not enough hours in the day to be watching movies all the time.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.360]   You know, can I tell you what?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.880]   I just bought one of the new iPod Touch the 32 gig because finally it's big enough to
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   put some video on it.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   And what did I do?
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.360]   I went to iTunes and I bought like five shows, you know, five season series.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.200]   I buy that stuff if I can.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   If I can, I buy it.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.680]   HBO is notorious though for not offering their stuff.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.000]   You know, eventually they'll put it on DVD.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.200]   I think HBO is really missing the boat by not offering it on.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.520]   No, I get their stuff because the wire is on DVD.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.600]   Yeah, no, I'm saying they do it on DVD, but that's a year later or two years later.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.040]   I want to watch Rome now.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.360]   I can't because it's not yet out on DVD.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.360]   I really wish they would speed it up.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   And I think that's a mistake.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   Don't present an appie.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.280]   No, I want, you know, the last season, the four season of rescue.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.640]   Me, the, you know, it would be nice to have all this stuff out much faster.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.240]   I'm still on the fourth or the fifth season of West Wing.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.280]   I'm like five years behind.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.280]   West Wing.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   I love that show.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.000]   But you know, when Aaron, I didn't realize, but Aaron, Sorkin left after the fourth season
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and the show really became pedestrian.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.640]   Well, then he went over to do that show about the backstage thing.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.120]   Studio 60, I loved that show.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.360]   And that, yeah, I liked it too, but it dropped dead.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   You know why?
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.160]   Because only the only people I know who liked it were in television.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.400]   Yeah, it's inside baseball.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.240]   Totally.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.440]   It's like sports night, same thing, right?
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   Which is sports night.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   It's so funny.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.240]   I mean, I don't know if it was funny for anybody who loved it in television.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   Right.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.400]   If you've worked in TV, you go, "I recognize that guy."
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.240]   Well, that's why I liked the show.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.520]   I mean, if you're going to make one of those shows work, they have to be like a kind of
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.880]   over the top and not even close to being honest like that show, 30 Rock or whatever it is,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.880]   the Teen of Fame.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   Right.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.880]   I mean, it's funny.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   It's a funny show.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880]   It has nothing to do with reality.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   Right.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   Well, there's a very show.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.560]   There's moments that are absolutely as you do with reality.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.320]   I mean, from the first few minutes of the first episode, there's a lot of stuff in there.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.920]   There's a couple of items that are okay in that regard, but it's not like that other
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.120]   show, which was like the real thing.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.360]   It almost felt like you're in the back rooms.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.800]   Yeah, but it doesn't have to be.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.080]   I mean, because 30 rocks.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   That's my point.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:41.280]   I'll be honest though, when I watch "Sorkin Stuff," whether it's West Wing or sports night
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.440]   or studio 60, I feel so stupid.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.800]   Those guys talk so fast and everything they say is perfect and brilliant.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   That's why it's like Howard Hawks.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.720]   It's like a Howard Hawks film, exactly.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.760]   Robot chicken is much more my pace.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.640]   I feel smart watching that.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.320]   So talking about what's on your computer, here's an interesting story.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.720]   Sebastian Boucher crossing the US-Canadian border.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.600]   Agents said we'd like to see what's on your laptop.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.960]   This is happening more and more, by the way.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.720]   They saw some titles of video files that really caught their eye.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:22.000]   I'm not going to read them because they're so evil, but they said this is child porn.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.480]   They're encrypted.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   Now he cooperated right up to the point where they said we want the password, then he said,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.120]   "No."
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.800]   Now here's the interesting issue.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.400]   Some think this would violate his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.080]   It's actually they're going to go to court.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.840]   The EFF is involved defending him.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.040]   A federal magistrate has ruled that forcing Boucher to surrender the password would be
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.200]   unconstitutional.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:56.080]   He's protected by the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.080]   What do you think?
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.000]   That's the law and that's absolutely right.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.720]   It's unconscionable that he's...
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.600]   Well, we don't know what he was transporting.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   We don't know.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:13.200]   The least offensive one is pre-teen bondage, but there's worse.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.520]   But that's just titles.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.920]   But right, exactly.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.960]   He even said, "I download porn on the internet.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.920]   Occasionally I accidentally get..."
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.000]   And this happens to everybody.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   I accidentally get...
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Why is this again?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   It happens to everybody.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.400]   Dain, could you mark this point on the...
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.560]   Yeah, you get pre-teen bondage by accident.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.800]   So you accidentally download something.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.400]   He says, "As soon as I see what it is, I delete it."
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.200]   Yeah, but it was by Theodore Giesel also sued him...
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   (laughter)
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   I believe.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   So, okay.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.480]   Let's stop the story right here and say, "Yeah, it probably is true in the United States,
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.240]   but going into...
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.360]   There's some laws like, I think, England and some other places that you by law have
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.920]   to give up the password."
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   That's right.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   In England, you do.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:04.720]   Now, I'm not encouraging people to be storing crap on their computers, but they
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.280]   there may be some sensitive information that people want to save.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.640]   You know, it could be documents, personal things.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.360]   Two girls in a cup.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.800]   The latest version of DriveCrypt, and I think there's some other encryption programs that
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.880]   do this, have multiple-step encryption systems.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.680]   TrueCrypt is so cool.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.080]   TrueCrypt now, by the way, TrueCrypt 5 now available for Mac and Windows and Linux.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.560]   And one of the things it does is it makes it...
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.840]   They call it a plausible deniability.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.120]   It doesn't even look like a file.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.600]   It looks like random data on there.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.960]   So even if the law looks at your laptop...
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.200]   No, this is true with DriveCrypt, but the cool thing that I was going to mention here
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:47.160]   is that if you're forced to give a password, you give a password and it unencrypts something
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.600]   else, making it look as though you've unencrypted.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.760]   You just have a picture of your Aunt Mary or something.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   Yep.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   Two girls in a cup.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   That's all it is.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   Easy, there it looks like.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   Ah!
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   I never watched that video.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   I've got to say it right now.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.080]   Two girls in a cup?
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   Don't ask.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.360]   In a 2002 case, the FBI...
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.120]   Now remember Patrick when we talked to the Secret Service because that's one of the things
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.200]   we asked them.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.600]   And they said, "You know, usually we just ask the guys to the password and they just
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.600]   give it to us."
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.120]   They're like in a state where they go, "Yeah, whatever, here."
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.840]   It's crazy.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.480]   Or they'll build a case using keystroke loggers.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.840]   So they'll get up, they'll get up.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.720]   You have to get a warrant and so forth, but they'll put a keystroke logger on there.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.520]   In fact, that's what happened in 2002.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.600]   The FBI used it to obtain gambling records.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.120]   They used a keystroke logger from a mob boss with a mob boss.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.400]   In another case though, an officer...
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Here's...
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.800]   This is from the Globe and Mail.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.720]   An officer found child porn on the laptop of a man who flew into LAX from the Philippines.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:52.040]   A federal judge later suppressed the evidence saying, "Electronic storage devices are extensions
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   of the human memory and should not be open to inspection without cause."
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   That wasn't a password.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.200]   Yes, you shouldn't be looking at the laptop.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   That's interesting.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:08.440]   Increasingly though, we're hearing stories of in many countries, confiscation of laptops,
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.040]   confiscation of all kinds of electronics.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:17.040]   I think it was the FBI confiscated a woman's corporate laptop and she never got it back.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   Right.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.520]   Here's an interesting side topic to this problem.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:29.000]   One of the biggest trends in computing today is people using their laptop as their only
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.920]   computer.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.720]   They take it to work, they take it home.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   It's all they use.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.760]   I mean, I see as at Podshow, I mean, Adam Curry is one of these people.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.880]   They have this one machine and they use it for everything.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   If this thing is confiscated, which is possible because then I don't think most of these people
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   back up properly.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.880]   It's stolen.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.440]   It's stolen or lost.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.760]   You just lost your whole life.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.000]   I got an answer for that.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   Jungle Disc.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   I've been using that lately.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   I love Jungle Disc.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   What's that?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.080]   It uses Amazon's S3 storage and you run this thing and it backs it up to Amazon.com.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.600]   Oh, Jungle Disc, you know, the crypt, MOSI, Time Machine.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   MOSI's great.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   Carbonite.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   It's back.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   What's the best one, Patrick?
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.480]   You know, I think it's a toss-up between Carbonite or MOSI.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.720]   Carbonite's super simple.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   I love it.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.880]   I use Carbonite and they're an advertiser on the radio show, disclaimer.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.880]   But it's really nice.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.880]   Yeah, you right click a folder and it just does it.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   And I have four.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.520]   That's actually how I back up the podcast tracks after we record.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.680]   The machine continues to back up.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   I have a NAS here.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.200]   I have a local backup.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.640]   But I also want an online backup in case, you know, the house burns to house burns down.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   Right.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   Now that's the reason you want it being.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.560]   I tell people this, you know, that you've got to have something out of the house because
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.400]   yeah, you can have your whole machine backed up on the little disk, right?
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.000]   Sitting next to the computer.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.920]   But then the house burns down.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.720]   Look at, John, you should look at Jungle Disc.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   It's very cool.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.720]   It's very cool.

[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.720]   It's very cool.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   It's very cool.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.720]   It's very cool to say.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.120]   Chris, where are we going to see more of you?
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.600]   Is it live.parillo.com?
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.160]   Is that where we go these days?
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.720]   Yeah, I've been doing it for about a year now.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   Number 73, most subscribed on YouTube with the videos we record with the community.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   Really?
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   Yep.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   Wow.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   I've been doing about five videos a day.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   I break up the segments.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.760]   If someone's searching, they could find what they're looking for and find the rest of the
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.760]   community.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:46.680]   I get about 20,000 to 30,000 unique viewers a day on the live video stream.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   It's really cool.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.120]   It's engaging the community in ways that I couldn't do before.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   It's really neat.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.320]   I think you use Ustream, right?
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.320]   Yeah, Ustream.tv.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.440]   And Yahoo just launched this live.yahoo.com, which I've been playing with.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   It's pretty cool.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.440]   There's stick on there.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   Now, you know what?
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.240]   I know you crashed it, but I used it today on the radio show.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.080]   We got about 400 people worked fine.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   Every once in a while drops off.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.520]   You have to press send again.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   I think it's a very...
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.040]   Obviously, Yahoo is not up to speed yet.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.920]   Ustream a long time took stick them a while.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.720]   It takes a little while to figure out how to handle all that bandwidth.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.640]   But I think the fact that these are free and allow you to do this is pretty amazing.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.640]   I love it.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.080]   So you store them and then put them on YouTube?
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.960]   Pretty much we use the live video feed to record the video segments we want.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:36.000]   Of course, I encourage anybody to take a screen capture, a clip and upload it to their
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.120]   own accounts anywhere.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   I don't care.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:43.800]   You know what I like about live is it has that stick them thing where people who are
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.680]   chatting with you can also put their video.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.760]   I think that inner hole interfaces kind of interesting.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.160]   We're going to play with this because I'm running the downstairs.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.760]   We're going to start to build a little bit of a studio.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.720]   We're going to start playing with the idea of doing something similar to what you're
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.160]   doing because I think it's really interesting.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.160]   It's fun.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   Live.pyll.com.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.160]   Something like that.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.160]   I believe I'm correct.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:11.760]   But if you search for Chris, you'll find him everywhere.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   Now Patrick's still doing Texilla.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760]   Texilla.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.200]   Don't forget Texilla and System.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.200]   D-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:22.280]   You know, if you go to revision three, you can see it all.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.520]   It's right there.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.800]   Revision number three.com.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   Daniel.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   Daily tips.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   Big show on Texilla.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:35.760]   We do one big show week and then we do a daily tip on Texilla and System.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.960]   We just did a, what's the word for it?
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.960]   IP cop install.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.560]   We spilled a very cool erop.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   Oh cool.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   I should say firewall.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   That's really neat.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.060]   Texilla.com.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:52.320]   And if somebody wants to be your co-host, should I just show up or do you want me to
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   call ahead?
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.320]   Email roger@gmail.com.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.080]   You leave an email me directly.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.640]   It'll be Roger.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.840]   I email Kevin, but he never calls.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   He never writes.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.480]   Yeah, he's too much of a big shot now.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.080]   I think he's just getting too much email.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.280]   He never even says, I see they're doing Ignatian and St. Louis.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.520]   What's that all about?
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.960]   I can't remember.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   Are they like going to do?
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.320]   This is what we always want to do.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.480]   Do the show on the road, you know?
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.120]   They did a show in England.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.120]   I know.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.120]   Huge.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.880]   In England and about 42, the zillion people showed up for that one.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.800]   So I think they're just having fun with it.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.760]   Well, you remember when you and I went to St. Louis, I mean, that is a great market.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.240]   It was a great market for tech TV.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.800]   We got a ton of people.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   Absolutely.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.800]   We signed.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.440]   We were in the parking lot at a Comp USA and we signed and we signed.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.680]   I think that we were scheduled to be there for two hours.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.520]   We were almost six.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.560]   We were there six because the line kept going and we kept signing.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.640]   Pretty soon the guys who rented the tent, the equipment, the speakers came, they took
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.960]   it, they packed it, we kept signing.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.040]   It was just two guys on a fold up chair and a table in the parking lot of Comp USA and
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.040]   they still keep coming.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.040]   It was great.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.040]   I loved that.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.760]   Now that was fun.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.560]   If you go to revision three.com, you can see Patrick cut off his pinky.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.040]   Actually, that looks painful.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.720]   I didn't realize I cut off my pinky.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   Did you see that picture?
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.440]   It's you and a big cable chopper.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.240]   Oh, that's a cable crimper.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   Oh, a cable crimper.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   So you crimped your pinky.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.200]   We're talking about basically we're talking about wiring up, adding power and devices to
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:25.800]   your car and how to properly wire and fuse things so you don't burn your car down.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.800]   Crimp?
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.800]   That was actually a fun one.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   Cool.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   That's a system.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   That's a system.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   That's why I see them.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   And Texilla Daily.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   And Texilla.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.400]   And John C. Devorek is on daily too.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.440]   All you guys are working way too hard.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.000]   All of us are doing daily shows now.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.160]   It's amazing.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:46.480]   The amount of content compared to when we were just working tech TV is stunning.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.960]   It's ridiculous.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:53.800]   John is at tech fives on Podshow.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.560]   Cranky Geeks is how often?
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.720]   How many times a week you do that?
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.080]   We do cranky geeks every Wednesday.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.720]   We stream it live and then you can pick it off any time you want to be on that too because
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.720]   I missed that.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.400]   You've been trying to get you on.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.040]   You're scheduled for not this Wednesday but next Wednesday if you want to come on.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.040]   I will be there.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.040]   All right.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.040]   It's a deal.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.960]   Let me look at my calendar.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.720]   And I expect you to show up.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.240]   Oh, you didn't mention that part.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   Like all the people who didn't show up for this show.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:26.280]   I don't want it to be like the lunch that I'm supposed to be having up in Healdburg.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.160]   Well, you just got to show up.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.320]   So yeah, Wednesday, what time?
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.520]   You should be there at 12.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.520]   Cranky Geeks.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.320]   I love Google Calendar.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.720]   So easy to add stuff.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.720]   I just...
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.720]   Yeah, it's actually quite good.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.720]   12p cranky geeks.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.320]   And I have this blackberry over the air syncing with it.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:47.400]   So when I update it automatically updates my blackberry and vice versa.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   That's great.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.360]   Cranky Geeks at ZD.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:54.880]   And you should also mention I do a show at the Adam Curry called No Agenda which is
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.640]   getting a lot of...
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.240]   It's just weird because we don't talk about anything tech.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.440]   And where could I catch that?
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.680]   You can go to curry.com.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   He's always got a link.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.560]   Or if you're like the devorak.org/blog, I also have something called the cage match,
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.920]   which is devorak.org/cagematch.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.120]   And that is run by this guy Baba who keeps the...
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.480]   He keeps a link on there.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   I just love the show.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   I just love the show.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.480]   Then none of this would exist with...
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.600]   I mean, you're not going to put this on broadcast, but it's so great that this weird...
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   Excuse me.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.400]   Did I just say weird?
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.640]   You mentioned Adam Curry, you start to cuss.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   You can bloop that at.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   That's what he does.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   He's on this show.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   He's like, "He's the guy cussing all the time and I'm not cussing."
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640]   No, you...
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   Cursing as my kids would say.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   Cursing.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   And...
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   Using bad words.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   You know.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.640]   Devorak.org/blog.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.160]   I will be on Cranky Geeks on the 20th.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.760]   Sounds right.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.880]   That's good.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.120]   And I guess that's...
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.200]   Is there anything else I need to say or do?
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.480]   Oh, we just want Chris Proulote to say goodnight dad to John, okay?
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.480]   Night dad.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   Hey, we gotta put that.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.640]   I need that for the sound effects collection.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   Goodnight, John boy.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   Goodnight Chris.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   Goodnight Patrick.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   Goodnight everybody.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   Another twit.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   This is amazing.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   Is in the can.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:38.160]   I should have paid attention.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.800]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   Too much work.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.360]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360]   So here's the deal.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:49.000]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   like forget it.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   I'm killing you.
