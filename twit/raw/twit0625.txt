[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   It's time for Twet this weekend tech.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.500]   We've got a great panel for you, Alex Wilhelmsen Studio
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.120]   visiting us from Queens.

[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.000]   from courts.com and Brooklyn.

[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.440]   We're gonna talk about big quarterly results
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.320]   for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Google's Alphabet.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.160]   Who's the big winner?
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.840]   You might be surprised.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.320]   The biggest breach of government info in history.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960]   It came out of Sweden.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.320]   And the Bitcoin fork.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.840]   We'll try to explain what that all means.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.720]   This all coming up next on Twet.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.880]   It's time for TWIT this week in tech,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.520]   the show where we covered the latest tech news.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.040]   Oh, I'm sorry you weren't here for a little here.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.840]   But this week, we're going to get very serious
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.760]   with a fabulous panel.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.680]   The editor in chief of the brand new Crunchbase News
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.640]   is here, Alex Wilhelm.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.080]   Alex Will Wilhelm.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.280]   Yes, that's my new official TWIT nickname, I think.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.960]   Yes, we're going to put it in quotes in between your--
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.440]   Next time I'm on, it'll be done correctly.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   But today, we'll go with that.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.520]   Editor in chief at the Crunchbase News.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.360]   How's that going, by the way?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.840]   You're new.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   It's going good.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   So far, I'm not fired at least.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.320]   Senior correspondent for Business Insider.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.720]   Steve, it's not time to buy an iPhone COVAC is also here.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   Good to have you.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.920]   We're going.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.760]   Great.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.520]   Steve is in Queens.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.400]   Queens, yes.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   Yes.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.320]   Long Island City.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.760]   Which is-- despite the name is actually Queens.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.360]   It's the new Brooklyn, I understand.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.040]   Yes.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.600]   And from Brooklyn, which is the old Queens, Mike's not happy.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.360]   Mike Murphy from the course.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   Hi, Mike.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.160]   Good to see you.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.600]   Hey, yeah.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.480]   First time on TWIT, you've been on, of course, on the network
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.920]   many, many times on TNT.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.040]   I'm glad to have you.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.760]   This was--
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.640]   This is actually-- it's good to have Alex here.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.880]   Actually, all of you, because you all
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.440]   cover business to some degree, because this was a very busy
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.920]   week for quarterly results.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.360]   Yes.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.480]   Facebook, alphabet/google.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.760]   I still have to say that, don't I?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920]   Because if I say alphabet, people say, what's that?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.240]   I feel like in six more months, we can stop saying that.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.640]   And the Times does not just say, "Weymo, a company
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   of part of the alphabet family, which also owns Google."
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.840]   Maybe.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   It takes too many words.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.240]   You know, it's complex.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.560]   Who else announced a quarter of--
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.040]   Amazon.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.560]   Amazon.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   Amazon.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.040]   Amazon.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   Wow, that's kind of free Twitter.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   Twitter.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   Oh, dude.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.680]   You had to bring up Twitter, didn't you, Mike?
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.920]   You had to bring up--
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   So Twitter had the dubious honor of being able to announce
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   zero growth.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.680]   They-- is it literally they had zero new users?
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.480]   It's a net in a new flat line, right?
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.080]   Wow.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.840]   But they said, but there's a bright sign,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.800]   because people are using it more often daily.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.360]   Daily active users went up.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.320]   And so we're talking about monthly active users, which was
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.080]   flat.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.560]   Do we agree that Twitter makes more sense to be judged on a DAU
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.080]   basis over an MAU basis?
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   Twitter does.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.000]   They think engagement is more important than new signups.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.160]   Probably, right?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.600]   I think Snapchat should also report--
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.440]   or as I snap, should also report MAUs.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.400]   But I think Twitter promoting DAUs
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.720]   isn't as bad a dodge as it would appear originally.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.960]   It doesn't--
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.840]   Mike doesn't bother me that much.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.400]   It seems weird, though, that they say that their DAUs are up.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.480]   And then they're like, well, we're not
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.040]   going to tell you how many DAUs we have, though.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.400]   Yeah, they wouldn't say.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   They're being coy.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.200]   Because so up could be like five more people.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.800]   I mean, it doesn't have to be--
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.120]   they said up a lot, right?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.760]   But what is a lot?
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.440]   Well, Wall Street didn't buy it, as we'll see later.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.120]   Yeah, Stocks went down.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.960]   Well, I'm just going to see a layer.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   You're going to see it now.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.720]   The stock went down.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.800]   Every time Twitter's stock goes down, which seems to happen
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.720]   a lot, does it put it in play?
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.520]   Does it mean somebody's going to come along and buy it?
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.800]   Or is it already so tainted that nobody's going to--
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.640]   is even looking at it anymore?
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.560]   Or are they just waiting?
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.560]   It's got to get way lower before someone really buys it.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   So it's just not low enough yet.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.680]   Right.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.400]   It's 12 and 1/2 billion, I think, roughly, right now.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.640]   So presumably, at 30% premium, you're looking at 15, 16.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's a lot of money.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.360]   Yeah, but it's--
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.920]   How worth it.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.240]   But it's where the president bounces policy.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.400]   I mean, it's the new White House briefing room.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.680]   The new--
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.200]   Well, that's the irony about Twitter, isn't it?
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.800]   Where so much news happens--
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.720]   I mean, this is an old analysis here.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.200]   And a lot of people have said this before.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.400]   But still, a lot of news happens on Twitter.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.840]   The president literally now dictates policy on Twitter.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.080]   And that gets picked up by every other media organization
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.880]   who sees the benefit of it maybe more so than Twitter does.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.400]   So that's like their big problem.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.920]   They have this very valuable platform from a news perspective.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.480]   But they don't know how to really take advantage of that.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.160]   And they're still being valued as a social media tech
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.720]   company when they're really more of a media company.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.960]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.560]   I mean, they're really putting--
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   when I go to the front page now, I see live video streaming.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.280]   They're basically going to do a live channel, right?
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   This is on the right, it's stadium, which I guess
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.480]   is a sports thing.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.720]   But they're going to do Neelai Patel's
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.880]   going to do a tech show, a gadget show.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.240]   They're going to have their own content.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.240]   How does that tie in what Twitter is?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.600]   It seems like a second business almost.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.040]   How does that help Twitter with monthly active use?
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.080]   It doesn't help it with me because I don't
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.520]   want to watch video on Twitter.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.680]   No, I go to Twitter.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.600]   And I presume most people use Twitter.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.080]   It's a feed of news, of information, not video,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.000]   but of textual information and links.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.920]   Somebody wrote a tweet to me the other day that said,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.280]   ironically, I was a big RSS fan.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.240]   I'm still an RSS fan.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.360]   I said, that Twitter is what killed RSS, right?
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.160]   Twitter became your feed.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.320]   Twitter also became the new comment section
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.440]   for all online articles.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   I mean, this is why no one really needs to have discuss--
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.240]   or just guess at the bottom of their posting more
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.080]   because we all go on Twitter to talk about the stuff.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.440]   We don't leave comments behind.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.080]   We put them into the conversation.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.920]   But that doesn't mean Twitter is good
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   from a financial perspective.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.160]   The revenue is down.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.600]   I think it was lost quite a bit.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.000]   The numbers left top of my head.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And they dropped 13, 14 points after that.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.200]   Tough day for the little blue bird.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.960]   You know, it's funny.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.160]   I come and go on Twitter at times.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   I hate it.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.200]   I think they definitely have a--
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.280]   their free speech policy creates a problem for them
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.760]   in terms of content.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.000]   And yet, I would hate to not have it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.600]   You guys agree?
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.720]   I mean, I bet you all four of us visit Twitter daily, at least.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.360]   Oh, I'm glued to it all day.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.080]   Glued to it.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   That's not necessarily a good thing.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.360]   So your sign is going to say that's what's wrong with you.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.640]   Right?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:55.960]   That's it.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.920]   You're causing a problem.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.160]   I'm looking at it right now as we talk.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.560]   I still have my Tweet deck open.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.320]   Yeah, same.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.440]   At least that's honest.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   I mean, I just got one of those 43-inch Dell monitors
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.600]   at the office, and I have Tweet deck now, like this epically.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.320]   OK, let me--
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:11.820]   OK.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.160]   --it's so great.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160]   Let's talk Tweet deck hygiene.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.660]   OK.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.400]   What do you have?
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.680]   What are your Tweet deck columns?
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.840]   I have home mentions, messages, and Donald Trump.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.200]   That's the least hygienic I've ever seen.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.760]   That's my term.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.600]   It's all over your face.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.640]   Isn't that what you want?
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.440]   Isn't that what you want?
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   You need the activity column.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.480]   The activity column is the best column you can add.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.080]   Oh, let me add a column for activity.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.760]   What is--
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.200]   You can learn a lot.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.560]   You can learn a lot about people.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.920]   It shows you what people you follow are faving,
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.400]   and a whole bunch of who they follow, and all kinds of stuff.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.560]   Oh, and it scrolls fast, too.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.880]   I should probably close my message.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.680]   Yeah, I was going to say it doesn't get some money for you.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.040]   But vacuum sealed.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.000]   My memory foam mattress with a mattress bag
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and lots of packaging tape filed under stupid DIY ideas
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.520]   that work.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.040]   Well, I'm so glad I saw that tweet.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.000]   Was that a Trump tweet?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.680]   It's only a matter of time.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.840]   It was too coherent.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.520]   My problem-- well, say I don't have that problem.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.040]   I have a problem with Twitter in general.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   And I've mentioned this before.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.840]   I feel like I'm having a stroke when I read it.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.960]   It's like, well, you have to spend so much time parsing it.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.400]   But you guys live on Twitter.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.880]   You probably-- it's just like--
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.600]   It's a new language, right?
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.360]   It's like looking at the matrix.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.840]   Yes.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.040]   It's data.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.680]   It's just like that.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.160]   Data coming down like rain.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160]   Which is why I like video doesn't make any sense.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.840]   Mike, you keep tweet deck open.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.560]   Steve, you keep tweet deck open.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   Alex, you keep tweet deck open.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.560]   I use tweeting.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   Like, what?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   Tweeting.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.080]   Tweeting.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.880]   He was in Star Trek.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.040]   He was-- that was Will Wheaton.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   Oh.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   Will Twiten.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.560]   Tweeting.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   What is tweeting?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.400]   T-W-E-E-T-I-N.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.560]   T-E-N.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.600]   It's @tweetenapp on Twitter.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.280]   It's a tweet deck variant that you can still run as a desktop
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.600]   application, both on Mac and Windows 10.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.560]   But it's similar with columns.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.000]   It is a tweet deck rip.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.760]   But it is a desktop app, unlike Tweet deck, which is now
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   a web client, if I'm--
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.440]   I have to keep my browser open to do tweet deck.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.800]   This is the best tool that I found.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.120]   It's a little bit less memory intensive than old Tweet deck
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.160]   desktop was.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.240]   And I run a lot of columns.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   So it's a big memory hog.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.600]   But I think it's the best way to go about it.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.280]   So this is what--
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.080]   I use it too.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   But it's kind of janky I found.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.440]   I even added them.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.160]   I'm like, hey, this is a great idea.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.520]   But the screen keeps flashing and giving me
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   like, I feel like I'm going to have a stroke.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.400]   And they're like, oh, yeah, we're looking into it.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.280]   And it was like a month ago.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.080]   And so I just went back to Tweet deck.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000]   I'm on their Slack group.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.120]   Their Slack channel, Reverend--
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.840]   it's called, if you send me over, if you back,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   I'll pass it along to them after the show.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   Shame.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.600]   Shame.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.440]   Shame.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.000]   Now you have to go naked and walk through the streets of--
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.040]   Oh, that's why Kovak is here.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.440]   My struggles.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.720]   By the way, episode three game of Thrones,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.040]   we only got three more episodes.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.600]   What the hell?
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   We just got it back.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   Wait.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.560]   We just got it back.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.560]   I think it's seven episodes.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.040]   Seven?
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.600]   Oh, good.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.840]   Four.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.280]   One month, we're going to-- we have to wait again.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.440]   Is there another season coming?
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.280]   Yeah, they split it in half.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.320]   Oh, hey, Josh.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.280]   Hey, when they do that.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.840]   Anyway, back to Tweet deck.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.160]   This has been-- what's on Leo's mind?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.720]   What the hell's on my-- I'm becoming-- this is what happens
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.000]   when you look at Twitter all the time.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   You become discursive.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.600]   I'll close it.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.240]   Watch this.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.520]   It's gone.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.320]   No, it's not.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   You just reduced it.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320]   It's behind that other window.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.160]   Can't see it.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.360]   You are addicts, you gentlemen.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.000]   But it makes us better at our jobs.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.440]   I mean, if you were on Twitter that much,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.040]   you can't fall too far behind.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.360]   Oh, and that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   So if Twitter did not exist, we would have to invent it.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.000]   We would do a lot less.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.760]   I feel like I wouldn't--
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.160]   I'd just be on Facebook more.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.120]   [GROANING]
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.440]   Yes, so why not Facebook?
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.960]   Facebook is not a news feed now.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.080]   It's changed.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.560]   It's not.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   It's too algorithmic.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.080]   I actually have multiple times in the last week
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   try to go back and turn it into most recent messages
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:54.920]   from your friends.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.480]   It's frustrating.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.920]   And it keeps going back to the time
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.800]   of what they think is the most important stuff, which
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.880]   is like three days old.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.160]   And it's like, you can't use that in any kind of news capacity.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.080]   I just feel manipulated.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.000]   This is Zuckerberg's platform.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.120]   In fact, that's why I'm worried about him running for president.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.520]   It's basically a knob under his desk.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   Become president.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.080]   And he just tweaks that.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.320]   And the feed changes.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.000]   And suddenly, everybody loves Zuck.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.400]   And he's got all the votes, and it's over.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.920]   Is that really the risk of Facebook?
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.880]   You may be the more powerful users
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.120]   on the planet that doesn't have nukes.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.360]   He doesn't need nukes.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   He's got face--
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.120]   I understand.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.760]   I'm just saying, putting aside people that
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.600]   are nuclear powers, I think Zuck may be the most powerful
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.920]   person.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.400]   Because you can control opinion.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.080]   We love forget ICBMs.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.720]   He needs Facebook.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.520]   So let's talk about Facebook's results.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.680]   They had a very good quarter.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.200]   They're dead.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.000]   Like, they--
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.400]   When don't they have a good quarter?
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.240]   When have they had a bad quarter?
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.080]   They haven't.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.720]   They've beaten every single time since they've been public.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.000]   Beaten by, in a sense, beat the analyst's expectations.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.760]   You would think the analysts would then
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.280]   update their expectations so they wouldn't get beat.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.840]   Well, do things--
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.560]   Well, in this case--
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   --is showing slowing growth, right?
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.120]   It's funny, because Apple always sandbags
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.760]   and beats expectations by lowering expectations.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.160]   And then--
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   They stopped doing that, though.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.040]   They said years ago they were going to stop doing that.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.240]   They stopped doing that.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.040]   Yeah, you can see the gap narrowing between--
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.880]   They don't get beat as much as that guidance.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.560]   They don't get beat as much as that.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.440]   But the analysts get beat with Facebook.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.720]   Do you think Facebook's doing the same thing,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.360]   or just analysts can't believe how successful they are?
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.480]   Facebook literally has said for the last year
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.000]   that there is going to come a point in 2017
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.200]   where they're not going to be able to make as much as they
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.560]   have.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.000]   They run out of people.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.160]   They just run out of people.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.800]   They're going to run out of people on the internet,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.440]   especially with a good enough connection, which
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.360]   is why they have the crazy drones and things like that.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.840]   But they keep saying that the earnings are
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.720]   going to drop at some point, and then they post their best
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.160]   quarter ever by a country mile.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.640]   It's 47% growth in rev and advertising revenue.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.480]   You're over a year.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.520]   Yep.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.200]   That's unbelievable.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.120]   45% growth in total revenue.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.720]   Now, costs went up a lot.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.560]   Why did costs go up a third?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.240]   Facebook has hired as many people as they can possibly find
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.680]   that meet its criteria.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.240]   I mean, the hiring boom that's going on
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.480]   that's created a talent war between the biggest five tech
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.840]   companies continues.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.040]   And especially in the Bay Area.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.920]   It's also very bad in Seattle, but I think it's still
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.480]   concentrated here.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.440]   Running out of people.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:24.920]   Running out of people.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.120]   In many respects.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.720]   Now, I don't look at it the same way you do.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.760]   You're more financial-focused because of Crunchbase.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.320]   To me, the one number I always look at is net income.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.440]   Like, did they make money?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.760]   Maybe that's just like a normal person thinks about that.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.280]   And they made money.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.720]   They're net income's up 71%.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.320]   They're an amazingly profitable--
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.880]   They almost doubled their profits.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.520]   That's incredible.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.400]   Facebook's been profitable for a very long time.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.960]   So if you go back to a Facebook file to go public,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.560]   they had $1 billion in trailing profits
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.760]   before they went public.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.000]   Their operating margin is almost 50%.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.840]   That means--
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.680]   That's sick.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.480]   That means for every dollar they make, they keep $0.47
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.880]   for every dollar they spend the--
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.000]   Outside of capital expenses.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.480]   Like, data--
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.960]   A building.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:09.980]   And--
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.480]   But I mean, that's why there were so much money.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.160]   I mean, they were worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.520]   And it's probably pretty fair.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.440]   The question then becomes, I think, Steve's point,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.400]   when the revenue growth does to celebrate enough
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.680]   to become material, how does the company approach
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.200]   shareholder wealth?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.840]   And do they start doing dividends or buybacks?
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.680]   I don't care about that.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.040]   I don't care about that.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.880]   But me.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.400]   I don't care.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.160]   Who cares about that?
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.760]   Shareholders care about that.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.840]   That's all shareholders ever want.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.920]   That's what's killing apples.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.680]   The shareholders say, pay me, pay me, pay me.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.520]   Is that what's killing apples?
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.640]   That's what's-- well, I know.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.160]   OK.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.480]   OK.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.240]   But I think it's one of the things--
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.880]   Can you convince me as to why?
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.800]   Yes, because they have $200 billion in the bank,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.880]   and they won't spend it except to buy back shares.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   No, no, they don't--
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.520]   Well, they're borrowing against it to buy back shares.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.320]   But they're borrowing to buy back shares.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.560]   That's purely shareholder interest.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.920]   That's not in the interest of Apple.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.440]   Apple should take that money and spend it
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.840]   and find a new business, because they're running out of--
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   also running out of people who are going to buy iPhones.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   And that's their only business at this point.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.440]   Anyway, that's an Apple--
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.800]   They can build more buildings.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.120]   Oh my god, we're going to get to that building,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.600]   because really, the Wall Street Journal article this week
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.720]   was very interesting.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.800]   There was some stuff buried in there
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.960]   that may show some little trouble in the spaceship paradise
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.160]   there.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.480]   But first, I want to keep going with the Facebook here.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.600]   Effective tax rate.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.560]   I always look at this too.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.000]   Again, I'm not an analyst.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.320]   13%.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.400]   What do you pay for your tax?
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.760]   I pay a lot more than 13%.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.440]   40%.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.920]   I pay almost half in taxes.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.920]   13%.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.720]   Smart accountants.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.160]   Nice work if you can get it.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.320]   1.32 billion daily active users.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.400]   That's the number that caught me.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.080]   I've forgotten it had gotten this to be that large.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.640]   That's an insane stat.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.760]   That's what won 1/5 of the planet every day.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.360]   Every day.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   And frankly, let's think about it.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.200]   Probably a billion of those spend more than half an hour
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.760]   on Facebook.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.200]   Like, spend a long time on Facebook.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.360]   Well, let's pull the team here.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:58.720]   Go back.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.960]   How much time per day do you spend on Facebook?
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.720]   A few minutes.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.520]   I don't know.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.240]   Yeah, I mean either.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.520]   I'm not a lot.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   Facebook's a bit super.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.000]   Not a lot.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So that's really interesting how much we use Twitter.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Mike, are you a Facebook-- you spend more than a minute
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.080]   or two on Facebook a day?
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:12.560]   No.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.640]   I mean, it's, you know, check in family and friends
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.160]   sort of thing.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.200]   See everyone's still alive about it.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.720]   You made that point, an excellent point,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.520]   that Facebook's algorithmic feed means you're not--
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.880]   you're seeing something--
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   well, OK, Facebook must have noticed
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.680]   that I was talking about this National Review article
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.000]   because I put it right on the top.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.800]   That's some next level layout.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.760]   That's scary.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.400]   There's Ian Thompson.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:35.880]   That's good.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.680]   Mark Canner.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.440]   He put a fake news story up earlier this morning,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.680]   so I'm going to unfollow him.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.600]   You're scrolling.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.440]   Do you care about any of this?
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.320]   No, none of this.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.760]   But look at that late Sunday.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.600]   What's the problem here?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.520]   If you compare this-- look how much--
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.720]   OK, look how much real estate my friend Ray used
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.520]   with this meaningless post, right?
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.600]   Oh, it doesn't work.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.960]   Oh, you can use a pen if you want to write.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   Let's feel.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.240]   And-- [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.280]   This is bad.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.680]   And then go back and look at TweetDeck
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.280]   and how much richness there is on the page.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.200]   I guess that's-- if you're looking for information density,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.280]   is that what we're looking for?
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.520]   Personally, yes.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.960]   It's a hard argument, though.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.120]   In some cases, yeah, you are.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.720]   We're journalists where we want to know as much information
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.680]   as possible in the most efficient way.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   But if you're my mom on Facebook and just hanging out
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.740]   looking at old photos of what me and my sister are doing
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.440]   or something like that, you don't necessarily
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.960]   want to jam it with stuff.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.800]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   Most people probably like pictures, right?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.800]   Digital accountants--
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.080]   I go to TweetDeck.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.280]   It's a lot of text.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.240]   There's some pictures.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   But it's mostly text.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.400]   It's probably Trump, though.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.600]   He's not helping that.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   Yeah, Donald-- he did one picture the other day.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.600]   I was blown away.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.200]   I said somebody's teaching him how to use there it is.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.640]   He embedded a video.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.960]   That was him.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.360]   That was his balance.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.840]   And he even-- if he--
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.000]   He used the video emoji.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.560]   Like, this is a video.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.600]   I was like, Donald.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.480]   No, no, it's Dan.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.320]   Dan's comedian.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.600]   His social media.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.440]   So Dan has real Donald Trump as well as POTUS.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.480]   I guess so.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think Trump dictates a lot of these.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.560]   I don't think he sits down in front of TweetDeck
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   on his own computer and types out a message on his laptop.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.960]   Are you sure, KofiVee?
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.520]   Maybe Sean's--
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.040]   Those are him.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   --how people too many of these.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.480]   Yeah, the ones that are misspelled,
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.760]   the ones that have grammar errors,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.840]   or weird spacing that doesn't make any sense,
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.040]   or weird capitalization of nouns, those are our president.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.960]   You know one way to know.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   So he used an iPhone to post the most recent one.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.920]   That's probably not him, right?
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.960]   That's Dan.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.460]   No.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:36.960]   Because he used--
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.720]   He has an iPhone now, too.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.440]   Oh, he has an iPhone back to the iPhone?
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.000]   He has an iPhone with one app, and that one app is Twitter.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.200]   Is that true?
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.120]   I think I read that article.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:47.900]   They gave--
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.400]   So they got rid of the Galaxy S3.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.080]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.760]   Security.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.120]   Oh, yeah, these are all from iPhone.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.080]   I mean, it's Dufcon week.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.240]   Are you saying Android isn't secure?
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.840]   It's more secure than it used to be.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.080]   It's always Windows XP.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.120]   Yeah, these are all iPhone now.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.760]   OK, well, my old trick of looking at what the platform was
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.480]   is no longer good.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.280]   So back to Facebook.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.080]   Did we set everything there is to do?
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.000]   A mobile advertising revenue?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.960]   Get this.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.240]   Remember when Facebook, we were always wondering,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.200]   you know, can they go from desktop revenue and advertising
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.000]   to that very difficult nut to crack, mobile advertising?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.800]   87% of their revenues, mobile advertising.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.560]   I guess they cracked that nut.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.480]   Just a little bit.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.000]   Holy cow.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.040]   You had count.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.360]   You were saying that one of the expenditures was people
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.720]   went up 43%.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   There you go.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.080]   There you go.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.480]   And when Apple goes up, you know they're
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.800]   hiring people with a store.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.760]   When Amazon's went up like crazy, but you know,
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.320]   they're just putting people--
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.920]   it's all pickers in the fulfillment centers, right?
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   And they crossed 2 billion monthly active users, which
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.120]   is insane.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.040]   I buried the lead.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.480]   You buried the lead a little bit.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   We counted it last.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.280]   But 2 billion M.A. is for Facebook.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.520]   You're not talking about video, though.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.240]   Video is their next big growth opportunity.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.080]   At least that's how they view it.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.200]   They think they can scrape some of those ad dollars away
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.080]   from television.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.360]   And so they're doing those original shows and partnering
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.040]   with other media companies to do some kind of short form
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.080]   original programming.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.720]   So that's going to be an interesting experiment
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.640]   to watch next quarter.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   Total TV ad by--
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.480]   In the US?
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.200]   In the US.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.440]   It's like 100 billion.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.440]   It's a lot.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.040]   Are we playing guests or are you asking?
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.600]   No, I was asking if you know.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.200]   But I'm trying to find it.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   It's at 113 billion as a fiscal 2015.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   I made that up.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   They're looking like that.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.040]   So what's the ticket?
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.440]   I don't like to do what you're talking about.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.160]   So could you say fiscal or material in a sentence about finance?
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.480]   Everyone will think you're talking--
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.280]   This is gap or non-cap?
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:48.720]   Excuse me.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.280]   Is that a net number?
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.200]   Or is that a gross debt metric?
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.400]   Chatroom will find it for me.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.840]   Just a chatroom, a little research.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.880]   How much was spent in the United States on television ads
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.520]   this year?
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.160]   I know it was in that ball.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.080]   It's a lot of money.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.160]   And of course, people are looking at TV, watching viewer numbers
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.400]   aren't going down a lot.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.440]   But people are looking at new ways to advertise.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   So what Facebook said, we're going to spend like 100 million--
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.080]   We're going to spend as much as a million a minute or 3 million
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.640]   a minute.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.480]   Wait, 3 million a minute?
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.480]   It was a lot of money.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.000]   What was it?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.480]   No, 3 million for 10 minutes.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.280]   That's what it was.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.040]   We're going to-- willing to spend as much as 3 million--
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.400]   They're all short form, right?
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.080]   Is that right, Steve?
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.120]   They're all short form.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.640]   Right.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.800]   For now, I think they're going to go long form
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.360]   and have traditional 30-minute hour long shows as well.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.560]   And they'll be episodic, serialized fictional stuff?
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.520]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.360]   Yeah, it sounds like they're doing-- going that way.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.320]   I mean, just like Apple's noodling around with doing that.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.480]   And we've seen Amazon do it.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   And of course, Netflix is doing it.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.720]   Snapchat's even experimenting with doing reality TV.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.440]   It's all these platforms seem to have learned
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.480]   that if they dump enough money into content,
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.120]   they can get at least some hits.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.360]   Well, but you can screw it up.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.640]   Apple's kind of screwed it up, right?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.240]   Are you saying--
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.080]   --apples.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.080]   Kind of screwed it up, right?
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.640]   Are you saying--
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.120]   Oh, my God.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.160]   --apples isn't good?
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.120]   How dare you say it?
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:06.800]   But they're serious.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.880]   I heard they were serious.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.920]   They hired these two guys, some two big fancy Hollywood dudes
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.880]   who are going to apparently turn all that around.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.480]   So--
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.280]   Yeah, the best man.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   --see.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.920]   Yeah, so the plan of the apps was, you know, yeah, it's terrible.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.560]   But that doesn't mean moving forward.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.120]   They're not taking it more seriously.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.880]   And again, they'll make loads of money to it.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.920]   If that's what you thought, like your big strategy
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.280]   is we're going to go into video.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.560]   And you, Apple, one of the largest companies in the world,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.880]   that was what you came up with.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.280]   That's what you think the average person's
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.680]   going to want to watch.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.000]   Like, there is an issue, systemic issue there,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.800]   beyond bringing in some good producers,
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.440]   like that you're that tone deaf to what people actually care
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.920]   about.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.280]   I don't know.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.200]   It just seems strange.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.600]   We're going to talk about planning the apps.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.120]   So you're talking about hiring--
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.360]   what you're going to call it, those agency--
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:48.760]   No, before that.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.560]   I mean, like, maybe that's why they're hiring.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560]   Oh, yeah, you're calling, right?
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.160]   You realize they're so hilariously bad at producing content?
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.120]   Well, remember, because--
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.600]   But the mission for Apple video is very different
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.440]   than the mission for Facebook or Twitter video.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.160]   The mission for Apple video is just
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.680]   to up subscriptions to Apple Music, period, right?
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.200]   Correct.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   For now.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.800]   Well, but Facebook wants ad revenue.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.560]   Apple's not looking at ad revenue.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.320]   Facebook wants to create something that will take--
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.480]   by the way, we've got the numbers.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.200]   Thank you, chatroom.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.280]   I'm blowing them up now.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.680]   The ad revenue-- America's ad spend--
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.080]   $72 billion?
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.040]   In 2016.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.400]   Thanks.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.280]   Oh, it'll be the same, even though there's no Olympics.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.480]   So there's no growth there.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.160]   Thanks to PDO in the chatroom.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.760]   But PDO came up with an interesting number.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.960]   Digital ad spend was almost the same.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.460]   Wow.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:33.960]   OK.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.120]   I didn't know where the price was ready.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.680]   That surprised me a lot.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.880]   So Facebook is reasonable for Facebook to say, well,
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.920]   there's no reason why we can't get at least half of that $70
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.400]   billion right now, right?
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.240]   Well, they need to have a new revenue source.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.720]   So if they can tap into a Viva, but it's
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.800]   going to be a much more expensive revenue stream than stuff
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.080]   we talked about, they're not going
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   to be able to have--
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.680]   odd margins of 50% of your job, and not
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.440]   much money for 10 minutes of content.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.080]   I don't think.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.800]   I don't know if that's why they're partnering with people.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.400]   That's why they're partnering with other media companies
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.840]   to make this.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.800]   It's cheap.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.360]   They can do a little bit of a rev share,
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.480]   and it's relatively cheap.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.960]   A lot of the cost goes on those media companies to--
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.240]   Who's done the best of this?
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   Is it Netflix?
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   That's the Paragon or Amazon?
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.800]   No, Netflix.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   Both.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.680]   Netflix is the best, but Amazon's pretty good, too.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.560]   Revenue-wise, Netflix has probably
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.000]   made the most money from its investment.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.440]   But Amazon's building something a lot bigger.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.000]   Again, their motivation is to build prime, right?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.960]   Right.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.200]   It's not clear to me how video stuff
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.680]   it's an Amazon's larger strategy,
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.320]   because it must drive the prime margins on a per-customer
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.160]   basis down significantly.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.120]   Because it's free to be--
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.320]   Well, it would have less than a video.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.160]   --and increases the number of prime users a lot.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.960]   Well, remember, here's the key with prime.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.360]   Everybody who signs up from prime
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.560]   ends up being a really good Amazon customer, right?
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   That's the theory.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.840]   Oh, you're going to-- and I notice--
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.760]   I don't mean say that because it's true for me.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.320]   I buy something on Amazon almost every day now.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.800]   Every day?
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.360]   Almost every day, right?
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   No, I do, too.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.760]   And that's because--
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.440]   Buying.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.520]   Yeah, what are you guys buying?
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.160]   What's your wallet paper, paper towels, battery--
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.040]   Good day for day?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.520]   You live in a million-year-old store in my own city.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.800]   I bought batteries.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.000]   I have batteries coming today.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.080]   I need a AA batteries.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.800]   I told my Echo order AA batteries.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.560]   That was on Friday.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.280]   They're coming today.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Sunday, right?
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:15.920]   Notice.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.280]   Very interesting.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.680]   No, it's not so interesting.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.400]   Go to the store.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.640]   No, that's-- this is such--
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.720]   so, OK, that's an interesting point.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.840]   That where Amazon makes its money is in saving me time.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.920]   That's what prime is.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.360]   Time cannot-- you can't--
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.480]   let me tell you something, young man.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.080]   You could make more money.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.280]   You could even get better looking, maybe.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.480]   But you cannot get more time.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.240]   You've got a certain limited amount of time.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.880]   Time's the most valuable commodity to you.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   Is that not right?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.680]   It didn't-- I think Gary Vaynerchuk told me that.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.720]   I agree with that.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.960]   I guess it's true.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.800]   I don't disagree with it.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.440]   But I do find that if I don't walk myself
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.720]   to the store to buy those batteries,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.680]   I will spend it in front of the screen.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.520]   Or a book, 99% of the time.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:26:59.880]   Yeah, so--
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.920]   And so for me, it gets me out of the time.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.400]   It's not good time.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.760]   Oh, you're like--
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   It's not good time that you're saving.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.240]   OK.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.000]   That's the thing.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.240]   I also--
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.960]   You've got to work on your life.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.000]   My part of those 3,000 miles away from me,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.640]   I'm bored all the time.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.760]   Like, what do you want from me?
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.400]   I like going to Walgreens for batteries,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.800]   endiodorant, and toilet paper, and wet wipes,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.200]   and stuff clean the counter with.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.880]   It's good to go.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.960]   So you-- it's just because you're
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.200]   going to get some fresh air in a wall.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.520]   And support the local economy.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   The people who want to buy--
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.360]   I agree with you on that.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.640]   The bodega near my house is owned by a family.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.400]   I know every single source.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.200]   So it's a political statement for you.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.480]   It's a statement that I don't think Amazon should be automatically
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.640]   given my entire custom as a consumer.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.160]   Now, somebody's saying the chatroom,
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.640]   and we'll have to look at the Amazon results,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.720]   that they made nothing on sale of physical goods.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.560]   But see, now, this is very deceptive,
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.080]   and I'm sure that you guys will know this.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.520]   I'm just telling our listeners, Amazon totally
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.960]   controls how much money it makes any given quarter.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.280]   That's not-- I always say Jeff has a dial in his office
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.880]   that he can turn and say, well, I think I'll
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.320]   make $100 million this quarter.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.960]   Because basically everything-- and this
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.360]   is why Amazon's such a success today, from day one,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.160]   and the investors hated this, they take everything they make,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.680]   and they plow it into infrastructure, right?
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.200]   If you look at Jeff's letter, they bought more planes.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.040]   They built more fulfillment centers.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.160]   They only don't make money on physical goods,
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.240]   because they're plowing the profits into this.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.120]   So they can make more money later.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.240]   Eventually, down the road.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.920]   Is that right?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.960]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.360]   It's the day one mentality that he always talks about.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   He always says, you don't ever want to be day two in a company.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.440]   You always want to be the first day.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.960]   Which sounds exhausting, but pretty hard.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960]   That just sounds like you never
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.040]   going to lunch break, and you've got to--
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:42.760]   I'm going to the boat.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.000]   You don't know anyone.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.880]   See, guys, we have a convert on the show, right here.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.800]   Well, I'm terrified about Amazon,
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.080]   because it is obvious-- well, look, first of all,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.000]   Bezos is brilliant.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.560]   He's probably, I think, the smartest guy in the boat.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.160]   Briefly, the richest man in the world this week.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.680]   That was funny.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.560]   For one minute.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.840]   But he's maybe the smartest guy in the budget.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.240]   I include Zuckerberg, and Elon, and everybody else.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.160]   Satya, and--
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.720]   Satya, everybody else.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.560]   The more you see his strategy unfold, the more you realize
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.760]   he's been thinking this all, I feel like, all along.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.720]   And Ben Thompson, his trajectory,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.160]   says the true goal of Amazon is to get a piece of every financial
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.560]   transaction on the planet.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.280]   That's a good business, if you can get it.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   Ben Thompson's way smarter than I am,
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.160]   so I'll trust him on that.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.480]   So how do you do that?
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.400]   Well, you want more prime customers,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.160]   because that's how you get a piece of their transactions.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.320]   Whether you make money on it today is not relevant.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.480]   What you want is you want to own them.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.320]   But now, here's a question.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.560]   If you were a prime member, what's the churn rate on prime?
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.160]   Do people quit?
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   I never heard of anyone quitting.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.240]   Amazon doesn't say, obviously.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.720]   We don't even know how prime members are.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.200]   They don't give prime member numbers or anything.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.440]   But they just say the average prime member spends
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.120]   whatever times more per year than a normal person on Amazon.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.600]   But that's the only really solid thing we get.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.880]   We can use ourselves and our friends,
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.800]   which is probably not the best no other,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.400]   but we can use our--
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.280]   You're talking about one-off cost, right?
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.320]   And it's recurring.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.120]   You don't necessarily remember, oh, on March 32nd--
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.640]   Right.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.440]   --or that's not a real date.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   March 22nd.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.760]   That's when I get billed every Friday.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   That's when I get billed every Friday.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.920]   That's a non-gad date.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   I think.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   Prime date.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   But you don't remember it.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.520]   So it rolls around again.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.880]   You look at your credit card statement,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.360]   and you're like, tan, I got billed again.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   And you might complain about it.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.480]   Maybe you'll ask for a refund.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.200]   But then maybe you'll remember that the services that
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.440]   might be loss leaders like their video service,
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.560]   you're like, I actually really like that transparent show
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.440]   or something like that.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.400]   And I really-- these batteries are great.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.240]   And there might be enough little things like that
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.280]   that might not be making the money that Amazon could make--
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   the way Netflix is more profitable just on video.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.560]   But overall, it's probably enough to keep people thinking, OK,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.720]   I'll spend another $99 on this year.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.320]   I think especially when you have the low-cost college subs.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.040]   It's like $39 to get you on board.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.960]   And then you leave college.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.880]   You're not going to stop once you've
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.200]   had free shipping for four years.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.840]   It's amazing.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.120]   Like, it is an amazingly good hook right into your wallet.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   Let's look at the--
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.200]   oh, that's the 10Q.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.240]   You want the Q2?
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.760]   I don't want the 10Q.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.000]   I can't-- I'm not smart enough to read their 10Q.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.640]   Let's look at the results here.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   This is the third annual Prime Day biggest global shopping
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.760]   event ever for Amazon, even though I think we all know
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.120]   that it actually isn't a very good deal.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.480]   That Prime Day does not offer particularly good deals.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.360]   You knew that, right?
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.520]   I don't shop on fake shopping holidays.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.720]   It's a fake shopping holiday.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.720]   But--
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.960]   It's all fake shopping holidays.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.680]   That's why I don't shop.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.120]   100's on Friday.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.360]   Hundreds of thousands of small businesses and entrepreneurs
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.680]   participate in the global event.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.080]   40 million units sold.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.240]   Biggest event for Amazon devices worldwide.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.440]   Record sales for Echo, Fire, Tablets, Kindle devices.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.960]   The Echo dot the number one seller.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.880]   They got it down to $35 I think.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.560]   So that's not a surprise.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.400]   That was a good deal.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.840]   They sold a bunch of TVs.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.960]   Amazon has the most--
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.000]   certainly not the biggest box office movie in theaters today,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.800]   but certainly one of the most best reviewed, The Big Sick,
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:19.360]   Commandant Johnny and Emily V. Gordon's wonderful movie,
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.560]   98% on Rotten Tomatoes, 16 Emmy nominations.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.920]   It's interesting how they run this--
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.800]   this, the successes of Amazon Studios
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.840]   is like right up there in the highlights of their earnings.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.960]   This is important to them.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.000]   Way before AWS revenue or international expansion
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.120]   revenue.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.320]   It actually makes money.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.840]   Is that because this is the sexy?
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   I mean, it's the highlight section, right?
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.960]   Also, it looks good.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.760]   That's what investors are going to want to see.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.400]   It's like, oh, man, not only are they
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.920]   a massively impressive logistics business,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.400]   they also know how to make a bunch of Emmy winning shows.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.800]   I mean, that's insane.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.320]   So to get back to that question, Amazon or Netflix,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.240]   who's the big winner in house production?
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.680]   I think it's got to be Amazon right now just because--
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.360]   I don't know if you all have noticed this,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.880]   but go on Netflix.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.720]   They're starting to take a strange approach
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.960]   to original content.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.840]   They might have seven or eight great shows.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.920]   Everyone wants to see the new season of Stranger Things
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.120]   or something like that.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.720]   But then they're putting out a lot more--
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.320]   kind of like--
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.400]   they seem like completely cynical plays,
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.040]   like a show that's just for teenage high school drama kids.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.000]   And then another one that's just the same show,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.720]   but maybe the genders are flipped.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.560]   And it seems like there's a lot more just trying and seeing,
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.720]   which is fine, but it does seem like there's
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.280]   a lot more not great content on there now
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.800]   compared to Amazon.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.240]   Is that what happened at HBO?
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.320]   They have big blockbusters, and then
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.640]   they have a lot of secondary, not so much watched stuff.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.200]   I think you have to try a lot of stuff.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   It's hard.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.760]   It's hard to make good, consistently good stuff.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.480]   I don't think that's a--
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.800]   I don't know if even that's a problem.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   That's why I think Facebook will never be able to do it.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.840]   I think it requires taste.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.360]   And Facebook has none.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.440]   Apple's shown that they don't have the chops.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.000]   No.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.560]   And Apple has actual functional things on Facebook.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.320]   Can't hire your way to it.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:15.840]   Can you?
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.040]   I mean, there must be people that are--
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.520]   They're crying.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.520]   Yeah, you can try.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.280]   They have all the money.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.320]   Well, they did try.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.760]   One note.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.320]   I'll just throw this in.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   This is from the information.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.160]   Remember that AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.320]   We almost forgot.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.160]   I did almost forget.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.360]   Yeah, but that's about to happen,
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.440]   because nobody's going to stop it.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.520]   And as that purchase goes through,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.200]   remember who owns Time Warner owns, HBO.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.680]   And remember that AT&T is very unlikely to want
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.840]   to spend money on original production in HBO,
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.480]   not to mention that they have $120 billion in debt.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.520]   Wait, AT&T is $120 billion in debt?
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.680]   Nice to watch the Verizon--
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.800]   And they agreed to massive dividends,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   which they're now regretting.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.000]   Again, that can kill you.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.960]   Paying back the shareholders could kill you.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.840]   If you do it stupidly.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.080]   Well, they have these obligations.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   And they're going to spend $85 billion on Time Warner.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.920]   So how much money did they've left?
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.760]   Like, that sounds like they'd be negative, but it's--
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.600]   Maybe the last game of Thrones.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   I'm just saying.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.720]   You're not going to see-- anyway,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.840]   the interesting article saying, will AT&T throttle HBO, Martin
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.720]   Peers, and Tom Doughton writing--
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.840]   I love the information.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.440]   I do too.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.640]   And I just like to give my plug.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.640]   We're not done with financials, but there's a lot more
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.280]   to talk about.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.920]   Defcon was this week.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.640]   Lots of security issues.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.240]   The country of Sweden has now released public information
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.520]   of every one of its citizens, in case you wanted to know.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   You could find out.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.720]   And I'll tell you what happened there.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.320]   Probably the worst government data breach in history.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:56.280]   Certainly the most appalling data breach in history.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.200]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.280]   Our guests, it's great to have you.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.840]   Steve Kovac is here from Business Insider.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.160]   He's a senior correspondent there.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.560]   Always good.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560]   I haven't seen you in a long time.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.400]   I'm glad to get you back.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.200]   It's been a couple of months.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.760]   I'm glad to be back.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.160]   What are those album covers in the law?
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.880]   I think I recognize a couple of them.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.840]   We got Doobie Brothers, Cass Stevens, The Empire Strikes Back
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.880]   Record, and Hotel California.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.600]   Those are all my father's old records that he sent me.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.160]   That's different.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.280]   They even have his name from when he was on college.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.160]   So it was like roommate didn't steal it or whatever.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.520]   That's different because that's music I might listen to.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.920]   But I was hoping for better from you, Steve.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:43.200]   Are you saying Doobie Brothers and
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   He's probably younger than me.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.240]   Also with this, I think it's his first time
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.600]   on the big shoe, the big round table.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.880]   Really glad to have Mike Murphy here from Quartz.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.000]   I love Quartz.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.080]   Can I just say I love Quartz?
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.600]   That's great to hear.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.160]   I remember when Quartz launched what a big deal QZ.com was.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.880]   Your part--
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.760]   It's an awkward website name.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.280]   Yeah, but I have to say saying that over the phone
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.040]   to sources, it's like, hey, yeah, send me an email at Mike
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.360]   at QZ.com.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.240]   They're like, what?
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   Like, it's too short.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:12.600]   It's too short.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.040]   It's too short.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.440]   It's too short.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.240]   Could you make it short?
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.160]   Yeah, please.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   It's like when I worked for ZD TV, people thought it was the
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.120]   spaghetti network, ZD TV.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.600]   Oh, because ZD isn't baked ZD?
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.440]   Yeah, they quickly changed the name to tech TV.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.040]   Because it's like, ZD TV.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.880]   What did the ZD stand for?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.000]   Are you a pasta network?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.240]   What exactly do you cover?
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   But no, I read Quartz religiously.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.920]   And actually, Quartz is a little bit in the news.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.880]   We'll talk about that.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.680]   Oh, really?
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.200]   Well, not Quartz directly.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:38.800]   OK.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.480]   I don't know what you're referencing here on behind.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.080]   You are obviously behind.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.560]   That's Alex behind Wilhelm.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.160]   Alex, Wilhelm.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:48.920]   You're lower third.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.440]   I like it.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:49.920]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.520]   That's fast turn around by the production crew.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.280]   We had to go out.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.240]   We had to go get our production guy.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.000]   He was at the amusement park at Six Flags.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.440]   He was on a break with his family.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.160]   We got him in.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.640]   He crafted that third, lower third, just for you, moments
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.480]   ago.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.080]   And he's pissed at me.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.920]   And that's why Twitt will never go off the air.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.320]   That's right.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   The attention to detail.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.320]   Thank you very much.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.320]   Our show.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   Our show.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   Alex is at Crunchbase News, the new Crunchbase News.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   Thank you.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   Can anybody go there or do you have to pay money?
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   Everyone can.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   Crunchbase.News.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   Dot.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320]   There you go.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   Crunchbase.News.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   Vanity URLs, honey.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   I like it.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   And I like your use of pseudo-Simson graphics as well.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   That's great.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   That's our lead designer, Liam.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   She has all of our stuff for us.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.320]   It's not the design.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   It's the color.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   It's the color.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   Do you like the colors?
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   I really like them.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320]   I like the palette.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.320]   She just gives to our studio.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   Love that bicycle.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.320]   She's fantastic.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   And it ties into the headline.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.320]   With profit taking a backseat to growth, investors fuel bike
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.320]   sharing hype in China.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   That's my new intern, Grace.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   She's fantastic.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   Grace Gu.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   Good job, Grace.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   She's way smarter than I am too.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   Grace, can you get on that, Alex?
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   Will Wilhelm graphic though?
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   Don't encourage my team to hurry.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   You gotta fix that.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.320]   It's a great job.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   It's a great job.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   You're going to encourage my team to hurry.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   Time for an Adley on our show.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   I showed Abraham.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   You know what?
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   You started it.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   You used to come in here.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   You'd rip me.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   I'd be nice to you.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   So now...
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   Is that what happened?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.320]   The gloves are off, Wilhelm.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   The gloves are off.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   I showed Abraham.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   No, it means I like you.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   I know.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   It's like I'm like Scaramucci.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   Does that make me Sean Spicer?
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   Sean Spicer.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   As long as I'm like, your right's previous.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   I'm good.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   It just means I like you.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.320]   I showed Abraham.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   I brought you by Hover.com.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   Love Hover.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   Love the Hover.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.320]   When you're going to get a new domain name, don't go to the place where they sell 15 other things.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   It's like going to the bodega to buy a .com.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   Don't do that.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   You want to go somewhere where they specialize in domain names.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   Domain names are what they do.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   They're not all about upselling you to some other product.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   Hover is very simple.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   They sell domain names and email and that's it.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.320]   But they've got them all.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   400 domain extensions.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   You got the .com.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   You got the .net.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   You got great extensions like design.design.tech.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   .pizza.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   Alex will Wilhelm.pizza.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   It'd be great.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Not Ninja.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   Wilhelm.ninja.horse.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   Once you find your domain, you can use Hover Connect.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   Look at all the services they support.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.320]   When you want to move your or use your domain name, it's trivially easy.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   You just press a button and they'll set it all up for you.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   Your domain works with whatever email programs you're using.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   One of the things people should absolutely do.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   We had a house painter come in to give us an estimate the other day.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   His email address was at Comcast.net.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   I thought, "No.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   If you're a business, first thing you do, you go to Hover.com
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   and for 10 bucks you get a domain name.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   You know, your business.com or .net or .ninja, whatever.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   But get that custom domain name and then have Hover do your email.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   They can either host it or have it as I, what I do is I have it go over to Gmail.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   That's very inexpensive.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   And that way you look more professional.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   People say, "Oh, do I have to have a website?"
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   You don't.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   I mean, but it's easy to do.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   But again, Hover isn't going to upsell you on that.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   They don't do websites.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   When you want to buy a domain name, when you want to buy an email address,
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   you shouldn't have to opt out of page after page of add-ons.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   You don't want to need.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   You, by the way, who is privacy?
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   Those are the guys upsell you?
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.320]   It comes with every domain.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   Every domain or registry.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   Well, if they can't, some of them can't support it.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   But all the supported domains, which is most of them, you get who is privacy.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   You want to trust me.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   With volume discounts, the more domains you have in your account, the more of a discount
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   that it'll apply.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   So it kind of encourages you.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   I think I have several hundred now.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   Several hundred total.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Oh, Leo.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   Oh, you have more.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   I have like five.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   What?
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   Oh, you're just not.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   You're a slacker.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   Instead of going to the Bodega, registers some domain names.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   With Hover, no problem, no digging through help articles to figure it out.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   You don't have to read the FAQ.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.320]   You call them.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   They're famous for their phone support.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   Or you can email help@hovered.com.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   But the phone support's awesome.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320]   There's no phone tree.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   They're not going to put you on hold.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   They're just going to help you.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   I love it.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   No trans.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   I have to transfer you.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   No.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.320]   They will do it.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   They have the best support in the business.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   Find a domain name for your idea and go to hover.com/twit.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   You'll even get 10% off your first purchase.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   Hover.com/twit.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   Really love it.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   All my domain names.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   It takes sometimes, some of these registrars, not Hover, but some of these other registrars,
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   are lows to let go of your domain name.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   For example, slow-sladdy.com perhaps.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   Slow-sladdy.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.320]   The minute you change the domain, they start to change it.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   They go, "Oh, we've locked that for six months.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   Sorry."
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   Call us.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   Call us.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   I finally got it transferred over to Hover.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   It was driving me crazy.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   It was Leo Laporta.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   I finally got it over to transfer to Hover.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.320]   Everything's at Hover.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   It's the best.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   We thank them for their support.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.320]   Hover.com/twit.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   Okay.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Who uses .Ninja, by the way, just before we leave this entire like Comcast.Ninja?
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   Like, "I am not a .Ninja."
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   Like, "What do you use it for?"
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   Anything you want.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   All right.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   What's the question?
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.320]   It just annoys me.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   I don't know.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   The rock.Ninja.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   But he's not a ninja.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   He's just a slabular human.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.120]   You know, if you were a ninja, would you admit you were a ninja?
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.520]   I would brag about it non-stop.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.520]   You would never hear the end of it.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   I would just ramble.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   All right.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.320]   Anything else to say about Amazon's earnings?
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   AWS was big.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.320]   We didn't get to AWS.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.680]   By the way, we should mention Amazon Web Service is a sponsor of some of our shows.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   Oh.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.880]   Can we still talk about it?
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.480]   Yes, of course.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   Oh, no.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   Absolutely.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.320]   But I just want people to, you know, I'd like to disclaim that kind of stuff so they understand.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.280]   I'm not going to say nice things about them just because.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:57.520]   Amazon.books, Amazon.books, open actual bookstores in Linfield, Mass, Paramus, New Jersey and Manhattan.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.400]   They have eight bookstores and five more coming.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.960]   What the hell are they doing?
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.400]   There's, what is the deal there?
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   What's that all about?
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.560]   Why would Amazon be opening bookstores?
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.040]   The big FU to borders and vertical.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.720]   We put you out of business.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.760]   Now we're going to take over.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   Right.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.280]   I think the only thing that might be interesting and it kind of ties in with the purchase of
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.120]   Whole Foods is that if you're good.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   So this is Bezos.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.560]   I feel like he's thinking 20 moves ahead.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.480]   If you're going to have everything go online, you take a cut of all transactions.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.920]   What happens to downtown?
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   What does shopping mean?
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.720]   There's still part of us wants to go.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.800]   You want to go to the Bodega.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.080]   You want to go to a bookstore and browse.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.680]   So I can't claim credit for this.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.720]   This is not a novel idea, but what, but I want to float it past you guys.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   I think he's starting to think of shopping as an experience as opposed to a purchase.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.600]   And people will still want this experience.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.200]   They want to go somewhere.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   They want to get out of the house.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.120]   They want to look at stuff before they buy it, but they'll still buy it at Amazon.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.760]   And so I think he's using these as experiments and hopefully it'll be like that, right?
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.600]   The grocery store thing is really interesting too.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.960]   I mean, grocery stores, the experience still kind of stinks, right?
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.760]   And hasn't changed in decades.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.160]   You go to a supermarket today in 2017.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:17.120]   It's pretty much the same as it was in, you know, 1967.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.960]   And you have to think that Jeff looks at it and says, how inefficient, right?
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   Right.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.800]   And so, you know, this cashier free store idea, that's one thing, the idea that you just can
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.960]   walk in, grab all the stuff you want, and leave on your own without even having to interact
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.280]   with a human.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.920]   That's kind of cool and interesting.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.600]   And I don't have to wait in line.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.880]   And then the person who checks you out is miserable with their job.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.080]   And, you know, they don't want to talk to you or whatever.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   That's interesting.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   That's an interesting play.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.000]   They could do something and change the grocery store experience.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:55.160]   Delivered groceries still kind of stinks as if anyone who's used Instacart or Fresh Director,
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.960]   even Amazon Fresh, getting produce.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.680]   And you want to see the food you're about to buy in a lot of cases.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.440]   And so there's room for them to experiment there, for sure.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.920]   I, I, it's kind of weird.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   Go ahead.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:14.520]   Like the difference between what Amazon go, their grocery store test is, and these bookstores,
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.400]   they're almost antithetical because the grocery stores are doing exactly that.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.200]   Like, oh, we're going to get rid of the friction and have this very creepy, personless grocery
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   experience.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.440]   But then the bookstores are supposed to be these like very experiential, like, come,
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.400]   look at our stuff, maybe buy it here, maybe buy it on Amazon, you know, like a, like a
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.280]   show floor sort of thing, which is like the exact opposite.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.880]   So it's weird that they're trying both of these at the same time for, for different,
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.480]   you know, industries essentially.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.120]   But what, I have to think, why did Amazon buy whole foods?
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.760]   And I think partly they think we can do better.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.760]   But I also think whole foods already had some of this vision.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.960]   The whole foods in Austin has a coffee shop.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.960]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.960]   Right.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   You've been there?
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.960]   I haven't been there.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   Yeah, I've been there.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   Tell me about it.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.400]   My sister used to live right across the street from there and we would go whenever I visited
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.200]   her and it's, yeah, you can sit down.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   They can cook.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   It's not a grocery store, right?
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.680]   No, you can get a glass of, you can get a glass of wine and walk at the wine bar and
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.040]   walk around and drink wine or beer or whatever, while you shop.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.360]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.720]   That's what Bezos is interested in.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.760]   Experience not shopping.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   Ambulatory boozing.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   Right.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   AKA.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   You just want to get rough in shopping.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.520]   Then you spend more because you're lit.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   So it's perfect.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.160]   I really think that that's one of the reasons whole foods was of interest to him.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.000]   Of course, there's a lot of other reasons, including all their locations.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.040]   So I feel like there's that Jeff's trying to understand what shopping is going to look
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   like in 20 years.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.280]   I have an idea that I want to flow past you.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:50.320]   What if he was watching companies try to reinvent the grocery world through Instacart
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.680]   and Blue Apron and realize that without having a physical presence that he could leverage
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.600]   to make Amazon fresh, more competitive in the long term, they were eventually not going
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.440]   to be able to take over the grocery business with their strategy as the market changed
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.640]   underneath them.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.520]   So they bought this asset that had Instacart and Blue Apron tie-ins in a sense.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.200]   You've got to think that you first.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.320]   I think that Blue Apron is praying that Amazon buys them because otherwise.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   Oh, Amazon won't.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.080]   By the way, Blue Apron is another sponsor.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:20.120]   I love the idea of Blue Apron, but Amazon is already offering in certain locations packaged
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.600]   meals very similar to Blue Apron than Blue Apron stock tanks.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.360]   Last week it really was hurt by this.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   But Amazon can ever do Blue Apron and it's own, but if it buys whole foods, I feel like
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.560]   it has a much better way into your kitchen and also much less.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.040]   Instacart is not a whole food, though.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   I know.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   The Amazon fresh is whole.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.440]   Blue Apron, there you go.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.720]   So they didn't buy Instacart, Instacart, another company that didn't do so well in the markets
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.600]   as a result of Amazon's purchase or depending purchase of whole foods.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:57.960]   So I feel like Amazon, I don't know, I'm trying to read the courts crystal, so to speak.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.920]   I feel like there's a long, I always think there's a long term strategy that's not immediately
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.360]   obvious when Bezos does stuff.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   That's just something.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.200]   It also gives you credibility, right?
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.280]   Everybody essentially likes whole foods.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.680]   They're respected for their quality versus the way you think of them versus Kroger's or
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.760]   any other supermarket, right?
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   So that helps.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.880]   If you are, as Alex is saying, trying to move into these new fields, I don't want an Amazon
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.920]   box of food, but I would want a whole few box of food.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   Very good point.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.040]   It's a brand they bought the brand.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.800]   And this is a big issue for them in general.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.200]   They are quickly becoming the largest fashion retailer in the world.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:39.120]   And yet nobody necessarily wants to buy Amazon clothes.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.240]   They're launching brands specifically just for this, but they're not called.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.760]   In the same way they have Amazon basics for batteries or whatever.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.680]   They're not buying Amazon basics clothes because people have some desire for branding.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.840]   They have some desire for some perceived level of quality.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.320]   I bought a shirt yesterday off Amazon for $12 from this company called Good Threads, which
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.120]   is as far as I can tell, one of their fake companies.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:09.840]   But it was $12 and it felt more real for some reason than if it had been Amazon fashion.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.480]   Like was the name of the brand?
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.240]   Like there's some utilitarian aspect of that brand that's great for certain things.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.160]   Does an Amazon own Goodreads as well?
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.160]   It does.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.240]   So Goodreads is a play on Goodreads, I would guess.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   Expect more good things from Amazon.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   We have two Alexa businesses, which is very confusing as well.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   That's right.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.000]   Chris Sager is writing in Slate.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:41.240]   Amazon is now the most interesting and important problem in American antitrust law.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:47.880]   I think if I'm Jeff Bezos, I'm thinking briefly, at least for the next four years, there is
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:55.840]   a huge opportunity to become a trust, to become a monopoly because I doubt there'll be any
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.720]   antitrust prosecutions under the Trump administration.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   I don't know.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.880]   Trump, they, I disagree with that.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.120]   Trump really likes to needle Bezos and there's a good populist message.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.800]   He hates Bezos because of the Washington Post.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   He's confused about...
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:15.560]   Well, also the taxing, which he's not obviously educated on, but he gets on him about taxes
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.760]   and then Stephen Newton said something this week about Amazon taxes.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.680]   So they're clearly looking at them and that...
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   That's the base.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   He's talking to the base for that.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   The base doesn't want any...
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   When doesn't he talk to the base?
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.440]   But I know, but my point is that's red meat for the base, but the base doesn't know from
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.840]   antitrust action.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   The base doesn't know that Amazon...
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:38.240]   Although on the campaign trail, he did say, "I'm not going to allow ATT Time Warner to
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   go ahead."
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.920]   And that was true.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.360]   And yet it's absolutely going ahead.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.120]   Will there be any...
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:54.080]   I mean, I think Congress might say we should investigate Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   Are people...
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   I guess that's a question.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.120]   Is the government starting to worry about Amazon?
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   And it's...
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:04.720]   Because I think what's absolutely happening is Amazon is making a very strong move to do
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.440]   exactly that, to basically become the place you buy everything.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.000]   And Dewey is consumers.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.720]   I like it that you go down to the Bodega Alex because I buy everything from Amazon and
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.560]   I've already given into them.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.160]   My new overlords.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.160]   I think...
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   Yeah, I think...
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:26.440]   Booker, Senator from New Jersey, he was on the Recode podcast a few days ago and he actually
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   addressed this very question.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:33.200]   And he brought up Amazon, the Amazon Whole Foods deal as an example.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.480]   And so members of Congress are definitely thinking about this and not that they can really take
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.760]   any action on it right now or going to take any action, but it is something on their minds,
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.480]   at least on the Democrat side.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.080]   But it's not as clear as it's been for past antitrust cases, right?
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.120]   Like you break up the bells because they're all...
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.680]   They are controlling the telephone.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.480]   We're not at a state yet where you can say that Amazon controls shopping.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.280]   It might get to that, which is a very scary possibility.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   But you know, as...
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.680]   With Alex, I still go to the Bodega.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.840]   I still buy batteries from other places when I need them.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.480]   And so what are you saying that they're a monopoly on all of our dollars?
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.800]   Not necessarily yet.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.680]   It's not like Google and Europe where they are the only search engine or something like
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.680]   that.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.160]   There's nothing that they are the only thing of yet.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:27.400]   They might be everything eventually, which is scary, but I don't know what the case is
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.840]   that you would actually bring right now.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.120]   I guess you can't.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.040]   And yet, my fear is it'll happen in a very...
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.920]   It'll happen so quickly that there'll be nothing you could do about it at that point.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:43.960]   And until you can prove that consumer prices will be harmed by going up due to an Amazon
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.560]   monopoly, I don't see how you actually...
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.560]   That's how it works in the US.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.240]   The US antitrust laws to protect consumers.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   Right.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.240]   In Europe, antitrust laws to protect companies, a competition.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.240]   Right.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   Oh, I was looking at this only from a US perspective.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.160]   I mean, I don't know if it's like your P.M.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.720]   The fact that's one thing that slows Amazon down is they don't have a very good international
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   presence.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:06.640]   And there are very big players like Alibaba in China that are in effect the Amazon of
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.200]   Asia or the Amazon of Europe.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.400]   We're also seeing, I think it was Bannon in the White House discuss, Google and Facebook
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.800]   also as monopolies of a certain sort, that there are kind of required tools to use on
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.280]   the internet and therefore they should be regulated in some capacity, which I'm sure
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.440]   will excite a lot of people.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:28.200]   But I don't know how you possibly put into place antitrust regulations against a web
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.880]   service like a search engine.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.720]   I don't know how that works.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.120]   And so to me, I think a lot of this is just talk.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.600]   And people haven't thought about how you would actually deprecate Amazon or break it up
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   into smaller pieces.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   But I think it's kind of one other piece, right?
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.000]   It was one vertically integrated stack.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.160]   And so just like you couldn't take Microsoft apart 15 years ago, I don't think you could
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.360]   take these companies apart now.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.760]   Now, I do agree that constitutional power is a risk in a market-based economy.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.720]   But I don't have to see any good ideas about how you could actually approach that.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.680]   And I don't think anyone has done the work required to actually come up with those plans,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.160]   not that they've been any good, but they haven't even gotten that far, which is I think
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.160]   I've embarrassed anything to do.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:15.960]   Amazon Web Services, which is the secret weapon of Amazon, powered really most of the revenue
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   growth for Amazon.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:25.120]   Its revenue rose 42% to $4.1 billion.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.120]   Anything to say about that?
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:32.440]   I mean, everybody from Microsoft to Apple to Google going after Amazon Web Services,
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.280]   but they are the powerhouse, aren't they?
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:40.880]   I saw a very snarky tweet about that from IBM saying that they actually had a slightly
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.200]   higher revenue than Amazon Web Services this past quarter, which was like, "Oh, yeah,
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   it's very nice for you."
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   Nice for you, IBM.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.280]   Well, Slice are talking IBM.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.240]   Let's talk about Sweden.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.760]   What you may ask is the connection.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.200]   I was curious if that was a segue or a jump.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:09.480]   So the Swedish Transport Agency, in 2015 outsourced its IT to IBM Sweden, ignoring warnings from
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:16.120]   the Swedish Security Service, and in fact, breaking rules in place to protect the security
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.320]   of this database.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:26.080]   IBM put the data unencrypted on servers in Romania and the Czech Republic.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   What data?
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.800]   Well, everything.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:35.520]   Turns out the Swedish Transport Agency has information on every driver's license, every
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.400]   vehicle, every road, every bridge, but even more than that.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.560]   This is something I want to...
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.800]   There's a New York Times article about it.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.520]   There's this article in The Hacker News.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:51.960]   Even more than this, the issue is what exactly...
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:59.320]   We know this data is now like public record, but what we're curious is what is this data
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   include.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:06.640]   Apparently, even things like the names of people working undercover for special intelligence
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:13.760]   unit of the Swedish Armed Forces, the names of people working for SAPO, the Swedish Security
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:19.560]   Service, people in the Witness Protection Program.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:28.360]   Everything, birthdays, addresses, pictures, all of it was sent in clear text to the Czech
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.760]   Republic where at least three unauthorized people had full access to it.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:39.200]   But worse, some of this data was emailed, publicly emailed clear text.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.560]   And then when they found out, "Oh, whoops, there was some secret stuff in there."
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.400]   They sent another email saying, "Here's all the secret stuff.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.120]   Could you delete that?"
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   Is this like a joke?
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.160]   They had no address encryption, no intransent encryption.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.160]   No, no!
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.160]   Clear detector.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.680]   If only IBM had a tool that was AI, they put a bunch of marketing behind to convince
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.680]   us how smart they were.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.840]   It's unclear how much of this data leaked out, but there's no way to know because it
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.480]   wasn't protected in any way.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.000]   It could easily have been copied and it could be on somebody's USB key somewhere.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.720]   And there's no record, so there's no way of knowing it.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:19.280]   Maria Agren, who is the director general of the Swedish transport agency, did lose her
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   job over this.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.960]   She was fired in January and fined two weeks of salary.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.000]   Wow, that's quite strict.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.440]   So she really, I mean, she paid the price, $8,500.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.800]   Wait, she can't spend $8,500 every two weeks?
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.120]   Yeah, it's not a high paying job.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.480]   It's a $17,000 a month job.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.480]   Do the math.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.480]   I can do the math.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   It's about a quarter million a year.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.480]   It's more than I make.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.440]   She was in charge of the entire Swedish transport agency.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   I can still be jealous.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.640]   I can be as petty as I want.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.840]   She also sidesteped security privacy laws.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.040]   She kind of didn't do it right.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.600]   Obviously they wanted to save money and the budget was tight.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:06.520]   Millions of personal records and data about the infrastructure of the country's defense.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.080]   Anyone with a driver's license, anyone who pays tolls and Stockholm pilots, train conductors,
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:20.960]   air traffic controllers, armored vehicles, bridges and tunnels and their weak points,
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   all of this.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   It's got to be terrifying.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   It's like a how-to guide for terrorists.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.800]   Again, maybe nobody knew and it's been sitting there for a couple of years, but maybe nobody
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.200]   made a copy.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.480]   But we'll know because you'll see it floating around on the dark net at some point.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.480]   Oh, for sure.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.480]   If it got out.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.880]   It was embarrassing for IBM, right?
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.120]   I mean, the old joke was that no one ever got fired for buying IBM.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.520]   Well, we now have a direct case proving that's-
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.560]   They were paid $100 million in this out-
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   $100 million.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.560]   But they didn't really-
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.360]   We'll put your servers in Romania.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.360]   It'd be great.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.360 --> 01:00:00.320]   It wasn't even really IBM as it was subsidiaries in the Romanian and the Czech Republic.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.800]   Are you making it worse?
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.680]   That's amazing.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.120]   So, okay, I don't- I just- It is now considered to be the worst breach of government breach
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   of data in history.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.120]   All right.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.080]   I actually can't be- Can I say one more thing about Amazon before we move on?
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   Sure.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.480]   So, the AWS operating income was 916 million in the last quarter.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.720]   And Amazon's total operating income for North America was 436 million.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.640]   And then their net loss in the international was on operating basis with 724.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.840]   So essentially, AWS made a bulk of their operating profits around the world and subsidized international
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.840]   losses.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.480]   So, that's how important AWS is to the Amazon engine.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   Not bad.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   It's not off course.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.760]   It's actually incredibly- It's kind of funny because it was an afterthought product.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   Absolutely.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.520]   It was just some engineers said, "You know, we could do this."
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.000]   You could sell it too.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.980]   That's actually where you have to say, "Jeff maybe didn't have all the chess pieces in
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   mind.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.980]   He was just lucky a little bit."
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.980]   You know.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.480]   Hey, lucky is as good as anything.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.280]   It's better than most things, actually.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.440]   I'll take a look.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.320]   Apples have paid a couple of big fines.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.640]   They just paid the University of Wisconsin $506 million.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   This is a long-standing patent lawsuit against University of Wisconsin, Madison.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.560]   District Judge ruled on Monday Apple has to pay that half a billion dollars for infringing
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.800]   on a microprocessor technology IP.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:31.840]   Everything, by the way, a previous $234 million decision two years ago.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.880]   And we've just learned from Nokia's quarterly results that Apple paid Nokia $1.7 billion.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.480]   I'm sorry, euros.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.480]   That's even more.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.760]   It's almost $2 billion.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.240]   For patents.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.640]   It's almost like Apple should stop stealing stuff from other people.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.760]   I mean, apparently it's not very lucrative.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.360]   They're fighting against Qualcomm still though.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.360]   Yes, they are.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.360]   That one's going to go on for a while.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   Qualcomm has stopped paying.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.560]   Apple Apple has stopped paying Qualcomm.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.000]   And then also, Alphabet paid a large EU fines quarter.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.760]   So really, it seems like some of the big five are trying to shell out and still just receiving.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.600]   Well, but Alphabet made $26 billion this quarter.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.760]   In revenue.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.000]   In revenue.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.080]   Their profits though were significantly more than the fine, right?
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.440]   I mean, I'm trying to find the profit.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.600]   It was a net income of $3.5 billion.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.800]   Including the two points.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.440]   Including the $2.7 billion.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.240]   So even after paying the $2.7 billion fine, they made $3.5 billion.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.320]   And they made a big point of saying that in their actual earnings release, they had a
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.320]   box at the top saying, by the way, if we didn't have to pay this big old fee, this is how much
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   we actually made.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.000]   It's $6.2 billion, almost more than $2 billion a month.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   That's crazy.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Revenue for Alphabet.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.760]   I mean, income, like profit.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.320]   For Alphabet.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.440]   Their cash position, $94 billion.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.000]   It's not Apple money, but pay.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.760]   I mean, I'll take it.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   That's fine.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.000]   Probably mostly in the US, which is nice.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.600]   But they, didn't they fall?
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.520]   Quebec after hours when they dropped this?
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520]   Wasn't there some disappointed?
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520]   They did.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.520]   And so a lot of that was due to TAC or the tuition.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520]   Oh, tuition.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520]   That's amazing.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.320]   Did they get a tuition credit for their college tuition?
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   I hope so.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320]   Traffic.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.600]   Traffic acquisition costs are going up and they're going to continue going up.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.080]   And that is really squeezing their margins.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.960]   And that's what spooked investors after hours that day.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.040]   So tell us about traffic acquisition costs.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.160]   That's what they pay mobile operate.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.520]   Alex, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.320]   If I'm saying this wrong, I'm trying to make it as simple as possible.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.440]   But basically, that's what they pay, like, mobile operators and carriers.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.320]   And so as mobile searches increase, TAC goes up.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.720]   And of course, mobile is only going to increase.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.320]   Is that also the money like Mozilla gets if you use the Google search box or Safari gets
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.400]   because Google searches are built into Safari.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.400]   They pay money to Apple.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   They pay money to Mozilla.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.960]   In fact, that's what keeps Mozilla and Firefox afloat probably.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960]   Oh, for sure.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.960]   For a long time.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.960]   For a long time.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.240]   So that's interesting.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.200]   You pay money traffic acquisition costs.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   And so...
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   If you ever covered Sistine Guilford.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   No, no, I'm just saying.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.080]   It's like it's just an increasingly large expense for them.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.880]   And they're honest about.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880]   They keep warning.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.080]   This is why it's happening.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.120]   The rise of programmatic ads and the two things.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.720]   These are programmatic and increased mobile searches.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:30.320]   Add business up 16%, but that's a slowdown for the 20% growth a year ago.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.520]   So it's still growing, but it's not growing as fast as it did.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.080]   In percentage terms, it could be growing the same speed in raw dollar terms.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.480]   But this underscores why Alphabet's paying so much money right now in terms of losses
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.080]   or expenses on its other bets because COVAC is completely correct.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.480]   This deceleration will persist.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.520]   And if they want to maintain their revenue, they need to have that next revenue source.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.800]   Next business, including Waymo, which is self-driving cars, Nest, which is the thermostats and the
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.320]   cameras and others, IoT devices.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.640]   I presume all the IoT stuff will be up to the nest.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.440]   Except Google Home, honestly.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.080]   And Verily, what is Verily?
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.800]   That's their health-dramatic thing, right?
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   Life sciences.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   Life sciences.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.760]   They do the contacts that like track your glucose or something.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760]   Do they...
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.080]   Do utensils for people with tremors, they make those...
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.200]   Oh, so they actually have products?
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.800]   You can buy the utensils now.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:26.520]   I think they sell them on, believe it or not, Amazon.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.240]   And another thing you might want to look at within Google, their hardware division and
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.920]   cloud business is growing nicely.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.080]   I mean, it's still tiny compared to the ad business, but they like to point to cloud
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.960]   and hardware, and that includes like the Pixel phone, of course, and things like that.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.800]   As something that just continues to grow and they're betting big on.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.040]   And then YouTube, of course, they really think there is a lot of room to grow advertising
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.480]   revenue out of YouTube.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:01.640]   YouTube has to be both a huge drain on money.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.520]   And at the same time, it's revenue.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.960]   But they cut what they must spend in servers and storage and bandwidth.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   You're right.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   Is that...
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   I wish I knew.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   I wish they would break it out.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.760]   It would look like it was going to be this time that they were going to break it out,
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.400]   but no, it's still a mystery.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.880]   And you have to think the reason they don't break it out is they don't want people to
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.480]   know what a drain YouTube must be, right?
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.040]   It's got to be one point.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040]   It's got to be one point.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   But they keep talking about it.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.040]   And they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:18.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:45.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:58.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   And then they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm not going to break it out."
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:29.040]   And then they're going to be like Bell Labs or, you know, SRI or...
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.040]   So it's like, Waymo came out, ultimately came out of X.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.040]   It was originally an X project that they spent on.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   And they just spun out another one called Dandelion, which is...
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   They got to get their names. This is ridiculous.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   Now, Dandelion is going to be not...
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   It's not going to be an alphabet company.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.040]   It's going to be its own individual company outside of Alphabet,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   but they spun it out of X and what they're doing is making affordable geo-thermal heating
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040]   and cooling for houses.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   And usually, I've never really looked into it until this happened,
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040]   but apparently it's a very expensive process.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.040]   And they kind of... they claim, crack the code to make it more affordable to install.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.040]   But it's only good where there's geo-thermal activity, right?
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.040]   How good...
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   Yeah, I think they're starting in New York State at first,
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]   and they might go on from there.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   Up at the Saratoga Springs, wherever there are in a spas,
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040]   there'll be geo-thermal heat.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.040]   Yeah, it's like all Iceland.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.040]   Iceland?
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040]   Iceland?
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   It's like a good one.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   We have a calistoga over here.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040]   We got geo-thermal.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.040]   And we can use that to power the city.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.040]   How close do you have to be to the hot springs too?
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040]   The plants are usually right next to them.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   Like, literally the one of the blue lagoon is across the street.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   So like, one side of it is industrial park and one side of it is beautiful spa.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.040]   I think you'd maybe invest in something a little more like global,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.040]   like wind or something.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040]   I don't know.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040]   Solar's doing great.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040]   Solar's doing great.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040]   They have a solar arm, right?
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.040]   They have that...
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   They have something in solar and wind.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040]   And they have wind.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040]   Oh.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.040]   I got wind, but that's another story for another day.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.040]   Let's take a break.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.040]   We're talking.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.280]   There is so much to talk about, ladies and gentlemen, so much to talk about.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.600]   I guess if you drilled a hole deep enough, you could take advantage of the difference
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.600]   in temperature between the Earth's core and the Earth's surface.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.600]   We tried that in Russia once.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.600]   It seems risky.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600]   It melts.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   Your drill bit melts eventually.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.600]   It seems risky.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.280]   Like, you're going to let Godzilla's going to...
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Something bad is going to come out of the hole.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   Or volcano.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   All you find is trumpt to me is...
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.600]   Are you sure they brought to you with great panel, by the way?
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.600]   I'm having a great time.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.640]   Steve Kovac is here from Business Insider, from Quartz.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.640]   It's Mr. Murphy.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   First time.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   How do you feel?
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   Is it okay?
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   Is it going well?
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   Pretty great.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   Over here in Brooklyn.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   Mike Murphy in Brooklyn.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640]   Steve Kovac in Queens.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640]   And the man without a country, Alex Wilhelm.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   True.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   He's a bi-coastal.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.640]   I now am bi-coastal.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   There's a rumor flow.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   Oh, you are?
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.120]   I can say it, right?
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.800]   I live in Leo's old house, ironically, in Providence, part of the time now.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   I grew up.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.280]   The house I grew up in when I moved out of when I was like 15.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.640]   He's living in my house.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   Oh, wait.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   Mike Gopher knows it.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   He's living in my mom and dad's bedroom.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   It's pretty funny.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   Talk about confusing.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.920]   I just got back a week ago.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.920]   I'm so confused.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.920]   It's a great place.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.440]   How did you guys figure out?
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.880]   How did you figure out it was his house?
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.360]   How did you make this connection?
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.200]   So his girlfriend was visiting and she mentioned that she grew up in Providence.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.560]   And I said, "Oh, I grew up in Providence, Providence for an island."
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.440]   And she said, "Oh, where?"
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.120]   And it didn't take, it took us about 30 seconds to figure out she owned my old house.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.360]   It was, I lived on Street X.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.360]   Me too.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360]   I grew up in X-number.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   She said, "What house on Street X?"
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   And I said, "There's 21."
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.000]   And she said, "That's my house."
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Wow.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.160]   I took pictures for you.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160]   That's by the way.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.400]   That's when I knew we're in a simulation.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   That proved it.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.560]   And that's the glitch in the Matrix.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.200]   I now know it's a simulation.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.760]   Does that happen to you guys?
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   It happens to you every once in a while.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.760]   Oh, simulation.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   Nothing on that scale.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   That's the glitch in the simulation.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.920]   If this is a simulation, I want to re-roll my character with better hair.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.920]   Too late.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.920]   Okay.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.840]   Part of it, well, you got to understand the rules of the simulation.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.000]   The whole idea is that you have, this is it.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.120]   You rolled the character.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.160]   You got to go from birth to death.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160]   This is it.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   There's no fixing.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.480]   Do I get to try it again?
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.480]   You could roll a different character.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.560]   But you've decided to do a chaotic mage.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.560]   And that's it.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.320]   You got to live with that.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.720]   I don't even know if that's offensive or a compliment.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.400]   I'll just take it.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.880]   Let's do it.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.000]   The simulation is saving Ram.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.520]   It's right untoward.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.760]   They didn't have enough Ram to have more houses.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.880]   And they thought, well, what is the chance of a collision?
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.680]   Oh my God, we had a collision.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.000]   There's somebody, there's some operator, some sissoming going, oh crap.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.400]   I got to rewrite that code.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.920]   Why did I give IBM this contract?
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.400]   You should have put more Ram in the damn thing.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   Our show today, see if they've used a Drobo, this wouldn't be a problem.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   Good segue.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.640]   Our show today brought to you by the best way to store your stuffed Drobo as a family of
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:05.720]   expandable, massive, safe, simple to use storage arrays.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.680]   It's all of that safe because, well, it was started by a guy who had a hard drive crash.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.080]   He said, I have a rate array.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   I'm safe.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.920]   And his data died.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.000]   And then the raid didn't work.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.080]   And he said, there's some raid sucks.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.160]   So he said something better.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.600]   They call it beyond raid.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.840]   And it is awesome.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.800]   It's got all the features of a redundant storage array, but better.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.040]   Take a look at the amazing Drobo devices.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.760]   I have multiple Drobo's.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.000]   I use a Drobo mini as my data drive from my iMac at home.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.280]   I have a Drobo 5N.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.440]   And now the no Drobo 5D3.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.600]   Oh, you got to take a look at that.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.120]   That thing is a beast.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.960]   Look at the 5D3 inside.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.200]   You've got lightning fast Thunderbolt 3.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.600]   So you're able to, you know, what is it?
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.760]   40 gigabits a second.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.480]   I mean, it's amazing throughput.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.960]   Dual Thunderbolt 3 ports.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.960]   So you can daisy chain it.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   You don't give up your port.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:05.840]   A USB 3 type C port just for fun, just for giggles.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.200]   The Drobo 5D3 has performance twice as fast as the previous generation.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.400]   It's their third generation 5-bay direct attach solution.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.960]   So not only is it fast, they put a faster processor in here.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.360]   And one thing I love about the Drobo's, all of them have this little port in the bottom
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.040]   that you can put a little NVMe card in, little flash drive in.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.840]   I do this in all my Drobo's.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.560]   And that really speeds up small file reads and writes.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.240]   It's a little cache.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.840]   Plus the Drobo's set up in such a way that even if the power goes out, you will never
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.840]   lose any data.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.480]   It's got a little battery in there.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.760]   You will finish every right and then safely shut down.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.280]   You can use a 5D3 to safely edit store and photos, videos.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.800]   If you're doing 5 or 4K workflow, it's fast enough.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.000]   It's big enough.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.080]   Back up all your data and then some.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.720]   And they're fully automated beyond RAID technology provides simplicity, expandability, and data
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.720]   prediction.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.800]   Right now, look at this.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.600]   You get the little sticker on the front when you buy it.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.440]   A free Drobo skin while supplies last.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.840]   Go to DroboStore.com.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.560]   Check out their complete line of products.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.160]   They've recently lowered prices on almost the entire line.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   But we're going to do even more.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.680]   We're going to save you an extra 10%.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.520]   On the purchase of select Drobo models, including this new 5D3, if you're a photographer, videographer,
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.040]   why don't you have this yet?
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.760]   Go to DroboStore.com.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.520]   Our discount code is TWIT10.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.400]   TWIT10.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.880]   You'll get 10% off and a free Drobo skin.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.800]   I love how it looks on the 5D3.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.800]   That's pretty.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.640]   I can go on and I can sing.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.800]   I am all in on Drobo.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.480]   The lights on the front that tell you all is well.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.200]   They tell you if the smallest drive is running low on capacity, you can just swap in a bigger
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   drive.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.320]   You can mix and match drives.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.880]   These lights all tell you something.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   That's awesome.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.120]   Plus, it's just a magnet.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.640]   You pull the front off and it's really easy to pop in the drives.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.840]   It's a tool that drives.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.080]   I can go on and on.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.680]   Get yourself a Drobo.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.120]   Get the to the Drobo Store.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.840]   Then don't forget to use the Offricote TWIT10.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.040]   Save 10% off.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040]   Select the most.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   DroboStore.com.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.960]   We had a great week this week on TWIT.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.360]   I thought instead of talking about it, I'd show you watch.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.440]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.960]   Lego is releasing a new kit that's going to help kids to learn how to program their own
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.560]   projects in creative ways.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.080]   These are traditional Lego bricks.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.200]   What the app has is a version of scratch.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.360]   If you move these little blocks of code together, things will happen.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.480]   And kids figure this out really quickly.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.120]   When you program it to pick up all the Lego that are all over your floors.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.120]   2.0.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.680]   It's going to have to be in my pickles.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680]   iOS today.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.960]   But you're in a restaurant kind of thinking like, "I want to see my food before it comes
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   to the table."
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.960]   You want to see the food at Tavern 62?
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.960]   Look at that.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   Oh.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.120]   And this is exactly the kind of food I can eat on a fast.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120]   Nothing.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.360]   So, Matt, break weekly.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.720]   Yes, the rock did make a movie with Siri.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.120]   Hey Siri, you're the best.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120]   Thanks.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.320]   You're so big, bold and beautiful.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.800]   Call me Mr. Big Bald and Beautiful.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.200]   Oh, I got bold.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.040]   I like Big Bald and Beautiful.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.560]   Siri, nice choice.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.560]   Twit.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.320]   Why didn't I get your mass text?
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.040]   I'm in your contacts.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.440]   They really put the extra effort into this here.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.800]   So you've got the pit stains, you've got the Darth Vader helmet, the scissor lift,
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.800]   nowhere.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.160]   Can I say this one of my favorite kinds of shots when they have to rent super expensive
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.720]   camera and lighting equipment just to put on a set?
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.440]   And never use it.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.800]   I forgot that I had Siri call me Mr. Big Bald and Beautiful.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.480]   It was a little embarrassing the other day when she responded to me that way.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.680]   You played it off pretty well, dude.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.480]   You looked confident in the moment.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   Oops.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.960]   Oh, we got a big week coming up.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.600]   There's lots of news ahead.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.120]   And of course, we'll have it all on TNT.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.000]   Jason Howell, what's on your schedule?
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.440]   This week on Tuesday, August 1st, Bitcoin could see a big fork that would result in something
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   called Bitcoin Cash.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.560]   This would be the result of many issues Bitcoin has had scaling over the past few years as
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.480]   transactions that should take minutes and up taking days or weeks to process.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.040]   We'll find out on Tuesday.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.280]   On Wednesday, August 2nd, Amazon is set to host its first job fair and almost a dozen
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.480]   factory locations across the US as it scales up its workforce to the tune of 50,000 new
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.560]   jobs.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.880]   Many of those will be filled on site as the company staffs up in preparation for the holidays
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.760]   and its other headline catching efforts.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.080]   And on Thursday, August 3rd, AltSpace VR will be closing its virtual doors, which some say
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.440]   is a harbinger of things to come for other VR outfits as a general excitement around
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.880]   VR continues to cool.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:52.320]   AltSpace VR launched in 2013 and supported many of the cutting edge VR technologies, but
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.560]   ultimately had a hard time convincing investors to spend more money with the company and in
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.560]   VR technology.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.440]   That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.240]   Join Meghan Moroni and me on Tech News today every week.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.600]   They had 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern here on Twitter.TV.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.600]   Thank you, Jason Howell.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.640]   We're talking the week's Tech News.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.320]   Let's talk about that Bitcoin split because I don't understand it very well.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.520]   But let me preface this with a little explainer.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.480]   Bitcoin is what we call a cryptocurrency.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.280]   I'm sure you've heard of it by now.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.840]   It's not backed by any government or by any institution at all.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.440]   Its value is a total what we call a fiat currency.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:38.040]   Its value is just what people are willing to pay for, what the consensual hallucination
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.440]   is that it's worth.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.680]   It's currently worth a lot like $2,000 a coin.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.680]   $2,600 or so?
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.720]   So a lot of money.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.520]   Although there's very famous stories about people, there's the guy who bought a pizza
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.400]   with like five bitcoins, so like a $10,000 pizza.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.240]   It was more than that.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.120]   2,000 bitcoins for two pizzas.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.720]   He paid 2,000 bitcoins for two pizzas.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.480]   That works out too according to my math.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.240]   $45 trillion for two pizzas.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.920]   That's insane.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.880]   So he's kicking himself.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.320]   The problem with Bitcoin was created by a person or persons we don't know.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.560]   pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.240]   No one's ever found Satoshi despite many articles claiming to a fan of him.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.600]   He's never been found.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.160]   It may not exist.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:25.760]   Whoever he is, he owns a lot of Bitcoin, which is one of the problems I have with all of
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:30.160]   these cryptocurrencies is it's a little bit of a pyramid scheme because if you invent
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:33.960]   a popular cryptocurrency, you get to keep a lot of money.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.240]   Because you mine early on.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   Right.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   When it's cheap.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.320]   Of course, you're betting that it's going to become popular.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:47.160]   Bitcoin is mathematically fascinating because whoever Satoshi was brilliant because among
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.880]   other things, the coins are created over a period of time over a period of time.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.440]   I think there's a pool you can create at something like 20 years.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.960]   They'll at some point, it will max out of the total of there won't be any more bitcoins.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.360]   Otherwise, it would become inflationary, right?
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.200]   You can't print bitcoins.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.880]   They just come into existence through a very complicated mathematical process.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.880]   Basically, it's kind of like prime factoring.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:12.960]   It's something that takes a lot of horsepower, but it's cleverly conceived because as it
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:18.320]   goes, it gets harder and harder to mine Bitcoin and it's actually tracked pretty closely to
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.360]   the cost of electricity.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.880]   Because otherwise, you would just and people do this.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.200]   I have a friend who's done this.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.800]   He's taken over his garage.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.280]   He's bought a lot of GPU powered Bitcoin mining equipment, spending lots of money for it.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.680]   He powers cheap fortune.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.920]   He lives in Arizona.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:37.840]   That's the only reason this is financially feasible because it costs him so much to
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.200]   create the Bitcoin and yet he still makes money because the net because power is cheap
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200]   is positive.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.560]   At least it was the last time I talked to him.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.840]   I don't know if it still is.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.760]   But there's a bigger problem for people who use Bitcoin and that is the blockchain itself.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.520]   One of the strengths of Bitcoin is there's no central bank.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.120]   Correct me, by the way, guys, if I'm saying anything wrong, this is just my...
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.120]   You're doing like a B plus.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   I think so far.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   So just keep going.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.120]   Keep rolling.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.280]   If I say anything wrong, fix it.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.240]   The blockchain is the entire database of all Bitcoin transactions.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.200]   All transactions are associated with a long, unique number.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.480]   You have one, I have one, everyone in the wallet has one.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:19.160]   And the database contains everybody with a number and every transaction they've made.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.600]   And the reason this works is because it's everybody who has a Bitcoin wallet on their
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   computer has the entire blockchain.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:29.760]   They have a copy of the database, which is approaching...
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.760]   It's hard to get the actual number, like 100 gigabytes.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.760]   It's large.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.040]   It's huge.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.040]   And there's a problem.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.360]   Bitcoin is getting slower and slower to get.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   If some...
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   If I pay you some Bitcoin, it used to take no time at all.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   Now it might take a considerably long time for you to get the Bitcoin because of this
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.840]   blockchain bloke.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.800]   And there's been discussion of raising the size of each individual block up from one
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.600]   megabyte if I'm not too far from my skis here.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.160]   And that's slightly been resolved now through the latest Bitcoin, what quote, civil war
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.560]   we saw resolved in the last 20 years.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560]   Well, this is the problem.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.880]   There's the Bitcoin Foundation, which Satoshi handed off the reins to...
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.480]   And I had him on triangulation.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.720]   Great interview with him, and Driese Anderson.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   Oh yeah.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.720]   Gavin...
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.720]   What is his name?
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.520]   Gavin Anderson?
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.480]   And Gavin's pulled out of this, right?
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:23.760]   Because it was a big political battle between some Bitcoin miners who didn't want the algorithm
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:30.280]   to change and people who realized the algorithm in the long run was not going to do well.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:33.400]   I hope somebody can explain the current politics better than I can.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.840]   You said, Alex, when we were in the promo that this is going to be an issue.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.280]   I've played myself because I have not been watching Bitcoin as close as I should in the
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.280]   last couple of weeks because I think like a lot of us who cover this space even a little
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.960]   bit, we've been watching the ICO market and...
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.720]   That's another story.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720]   It's ICOs next.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.960]   Yeah, ICOs are fascinating.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:59.520]   But the point is Bitcoin is working through some maturity hurdles, you could say.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.040]   And its community has come together after a potential problem implementing what's called
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.040]   S-E-G-W-I-T, Segwit.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.440]   But these are mostly calling out.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.920]   Whenever you say that, I play that music.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   Go ahead and say it again.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.920]   Watch this.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   Segwit.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.760]   I want a bit of theme song.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.400]   That's like Mashable style last week.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.080]   So Bitcoin was able to avoid a split.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:33.760]   But Segwit 2X, which will increase network capacity and avoid this damaging fork.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.360]   You don't want a fork because then you've got two Bitcoins.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   Right.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.360]   But are mutually incompatible.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:41.880]   But then the idea is Bitcoin Cash is going to be launched, I think it's on August 1st
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.280]   or discussion on August 1st.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:47.280]   And it's an attempt to increase the throughput of Bitcoin, making it more efficient on a
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.680]   per transaction basis.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.480]   Because running out is so much compute energy and therefore electricity goes into each individual
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.320]   transaction, it's slow and a little bit inefficient.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.560]   So Bitcoin Cash, which starts Tuesday, will have a bigger block size than Bitcoin after
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.360]   the Segwit 2X has already been applied.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360]   Right.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.360]   You know what?
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.120]   The problem when you get into this is there are Bitcoin nut jobs who are going to now
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.960]   email me for the next six weeks thing.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.200]   Leo, you got this so wrong.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.200]   And I apologize.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.640]   I know I'm getting it a little bit wrong.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.960]   There's also Ethereum, which is another cryptocurrency that has some security issues.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:28.200]   Recently, the largest bank heist in the world, $31 million of Ethereum was stolen.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.400]   Because someone changed their WordPress page to give a different address where people
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.720]   could send money to buy into the ICO and they didn't notice for a while.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.640]   In fact, it almost was $180 million Ethereum dollars worth of Ethereum.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.360]   But people started pulling the plugs out of their machines real quick.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.640]   Yeah, stop, stop that.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.400]   So blockchains are good is, I think, a good technology.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400]   It's an interesting technology.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   It does have this problem with it.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.920]   The database is stored everywhere.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.920]   It's distributed.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.720]   That's not a bad thing, but it is a technical issue when you have a lot of transactions.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.720]   We get to get everyone to agree.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.520]   So a SegWit, I guess, probably closer, they had to have a certain number of people signaling
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.920]   that they wanted to move to it in the mining groups.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.160]   And so the people that run these vast mining pools that provide the core power.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.440]   And that's really the miners, all the power, a lot of them in China.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.080]   And I've met Chandler from, well, I think it was an ant pool.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080]   I forget.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080]   From friends?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.080]   Because he's my favorite friends.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.080]   No, no, not Chandler from friends.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   Oh.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   Chandler from China, who works in Bitcoin.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.440]   Like two years ago, I mean, close though, it's almost the same person.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.680]   They look dramatically the same.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680]   How you doing?
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.680]   Oh, gosh.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:31.680]   That's Joey.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.680]   That's Joey.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.960]   And Joey, literally, you know, is actually based off of Leo's youth.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.520]   When I lived in Queens.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.520]   That's another story.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.520]   That's not.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.200]   So Bitcoin Cash will launch on Tuesday, and everybody who has Bitcoin, which includes,
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.400]   I have seven Bitcoins somewhere.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.400]   You have seven Bitcoins?
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.400]   Yeah, somewhere.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.440]   I can't remember right past for the wallet.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.720]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.680]   So anyway, I'll find it.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.880]   But my son says, please, dad, let me try.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.600]   So you tell you something that passed me, you'll have no Bitcoin.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.920]   Everybody who has Bitcoin, including, I guess, me, will get Bitcoin Cash the day of the
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.400]   fork.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.080]   There's already a futures market.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.720]   Currently Bitcoin Cash value, 13% of Bitcoin's price.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.280]   So when the Bitcoin split happens, this is according to Fortune magazine, something like
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:21.000]   $6 billion in new market value will go into existence.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.800]   It's the poofing of these cryptocurrencies that I think bothers people.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.080]   But remember, the US dollar is essentially a fiat currency.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.720]   It's only worth what it's we say it is, it's a piece of paper, but you can use it to pay
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.240]   your US government debts, which is why it has value.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.080]   I can pay my taxes and dollars.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.720]   I can't pay them a Bitcoin or euros or anything else.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.520]   Well, also you understand a piece of paper at the end of the day.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.600]   I'll give you a piece of paper that says one Bitcoin, if that makes you feel better.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600]   But that's the thing.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:53.200]   I think the average person assumes that because cash and existing currencies have existed,
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.360]   when we go off the gold standard 100 years ago.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:03.120]   Can I just point out, everybody thinks the gold standard was some sort of magical thing.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.680]   Gold is not worth what do you pay an ounce for it.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.880]   The industrial value, that's a fiat currency really too, right?
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.840]   Just don't tell Ron Paul.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.440]   So what a fiat currency is, is something that has value because everybody agrees it
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.960]   has value, not because it has intrinsic value.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.240]   And also because there's an army backing it up too.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240]   Well, the army doesn't.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.920]   But that's the thing with Bitcoin, what is there backing it up?
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.200]   If you try to explain, I mean, we just took like five minutes to explain the process of
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.400]   this, you can't do that.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.800]   Like, people just understand the value of a dollar, right?
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:44.400]   And no one wants to bring up the fiat currency thing because no one wants to undermine the
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.160]   full faith and credit of the US dollar, right?
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.800]   If we really started saying, well, it's just a pretend thing that would be bad.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.120]   You know, so everyone knows that, right?
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.120]   No one knows.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.120]   Really?
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.120]   I think the average person knows.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   It's one of those things that you know, but you don't, it's in the back and you don't
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120]   think about it.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   What does the average person actually know then?
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120]   Mike, we all know we're going to die, but we don't think about it.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   I mean, I do.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.120]   Exactly.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.680]   It gets me through some sad days and like, well, it's going to end eventually.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.680]   Fuck up.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.200]   Sorry, you're going to get another role of the character.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.160]   It'll be great this time.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.360]   It was 1879, the gold standard.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   1879.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.200]   It's been a long time.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.480]   That's been Leo left Queens.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.120]   So I'm going to leave it.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.120]   Yeah, right.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.120]   I'm kidding.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.120]   No, I was, I was, I lived in the five corners.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.760]   I was in one of the fire department.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.760]   It was great.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.840]   It was grosser the good days.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.840]   I carried an axe.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.280]   Didn't use it for fires, but that's another story.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.000]   Let's, let's ask the chat room because I bet you there's people in the chat room who
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.240]   are serious Bitcoin knobs.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.560]   I'm going to use that word and.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:52.000]   Does that mean something different in this country?
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.600]   I grew up in the UK.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   That's not.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.000]   Never mind.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   Never mind.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   We'll just, okay, we're done.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   We're done.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.320]   I just, something's going to happen on Tuesday.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:11.120]   The world will go on, but there will be some people, including Joey and China, Chandler
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.440]   and China, who will be, will he be upset?
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.680]   He will be upset because he's a Bitcoin miner.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.720]   I presume anything that makes Bitcoin worth more per coin he's fine with.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.600]   And since I've met him, it's appreciated what?
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   Forex.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   So I think he's.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   He's made a lot of money now.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   I'm very jealous.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.600]   The problem is when do you sell your Bitcoin?
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.280]   Because you sell it now at $2,600 and become like the pizza guy.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.640]   Oh, that could have been worth a million.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:39.040]   I think you sell until you feel like you have enough money to take on more risk.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.360]   I mean, you sell down to the sleeping point is the old school investment advice here.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   You have seven Bitcoin.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.960]   I would sell two, keep five and then sell two more one of doubles and two more and doubles
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:48.960]   again.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:49.960]   Then you're doing what they say in the casino.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.160]   You're, you're betting the banks money.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   Exactly.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.720]   I sell my Apple stock.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.000]   I don't know anyone to talk about that.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.160]   I sell it early.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.080]   Oh, I, well, I don't know any tech stuff.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.520]   I don't think I ever own any Apple stock, but we have a guy, Scott Borne, who was on our
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:11.440]   Mac break podcast many years ago, and I said, you can't be on the podcast if you have Apple
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.600]   stock.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.040]   So he sold his and he's never forgiven me.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.040]   What year was this?
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:20.040]   What year was it Leo?
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040]   Just as a sir.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.040]   Oh my gosh.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.880]   That's like right when they went into our eight or around them.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.400]   He's actually very gracious about the whole thing, but I know that secretly he wants to
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400]   kill me.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.400]   I mean, I would.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.400]   Oh my God.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.400]   I would.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.480]   But that's our policy here.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.840]   You've all sold your tech stocks, right?
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.200]   I don't add your.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.560]   I'm sure business insider doesn't let you have tech stocks, right?
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.800]   No, or any stocks.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.200]   Oh, no stocks at all.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   I mean, I have funds.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.200]   Well, that's kind of guaranteeing poverty.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.920]   I can know index and I am.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920]   I can.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.760]   Yeah, that's what I have for one and I can have that kind of stuff, but I can't bother
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.560]   and buy app or technically I do have tech stocks because I invest in the S&P 500 index
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.560]   funds.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.560]   So I do.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:03.560]   Right.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.320]   It's diversified and I don't control it.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.320]   Right.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.320]   That's why it's okay.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   I have money in the Vanguard 500 index funds.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   Exactly.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.840]   That's exactly the same investment vehicle I'm in.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.880]   But because we did that, we wouldn't have gotten a 1,340% gain on our Apple stocks since
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   2006.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.440]   And the old you took that guy's house away from it.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.440]   Oh my God.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.440]   Oh my God.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.080]   Was it like, oh, I got five bucks at Apple stock.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.680]   It was tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.880]   You owe him like $5 million.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   This is what I'm saying.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.800]   This guy's going to be on back in the studio and on the new screen savers.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.480]   I think he's going to do a Twit or no Mac brick weekly.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.960]   He lives in a box now, but he's doing great.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.960]   He's so mad.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:43.640]   I would just burn every morning waking up.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.200]   You know, just could be a mansion instead.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200]   It's cardboard.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.440]   I'm at six 1000.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.440]   Does he have an iPhone?
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440]   Oh, geez.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:58.160]   Every time he looks at his phone, he thinks to me.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.160]   I'm sure it's fun.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:02.160]   Let's take a break.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.160]   I showed it.
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.160]   I showed it.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.160]   They brought you by car.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:06.600]   But I don't line back up you.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:11.280]   I swear to God, you got to back up because it's just getting worse out there.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.760]   Ransomware.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.720]   The estimate last for last year's ransomware attacks, it's kind of interesting.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.360]   The amount of money paid to ransomware hackers is pitiful.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.160]   It's like $25 million.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.680]   The amount of productivity loss.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.720]   $50 billion.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.880]   That's because ransomware rips the heart out of your business.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:36.400]   If you've got a business and all your stuff's on your computer, your client list, your
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.800]   accounts receivable, all your financials, all your emails, everything.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.960]   And somebody goes along and encrypts it and takes it away from you.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.240]   Boom, you're done.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.400]   I mean, you really could be out of business unless you've got a good backup.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   What's a good backup?
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.880]   A backup offsite.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.400]   So it's safe from all kinds of disasters and gliacts of God.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.480]   A backup that's encrypted, a backup with versioning.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:01.800]   So you can always go back in time to that pre-encrypted, this is carbonite.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.440]   And if you're in a business and you are not protecting your most valuable asset, your
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.120]   data, you are just, it's like not buying insurance.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.440]   You have fire insurance, you need carbonite.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.440]   Go to carbonite.com.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.040]   They're for home or office.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:18.080]   If you're in the office section, click the resources button and you'll see a bunch of
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.280]   white papers about ransomware, ransomware mitigation.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.280]   This is all free to you, very useful stuff.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:30.120]   Create a disaster recovery plan and a big part of that is carbonite.com.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.680]   You could try it free right now.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.680]   No credit card needed.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.160]   They can't charge you even if they wanted to.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.160]   They know.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.600]   If you try it, you're going to understand how great this is.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.760]   For a home, it's automatic.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.880]   You install it on your computer.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.120]   You forget about it.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.000]   And whenever you're online, you're backing up.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.560]   For business, they have plans for servers.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   They even have the E-Vault, which is a local hardware backup that then backs up to carbonite
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:57.120]   and protects you with off-site backup.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.600]   You've got to try it free to try carbonite.com.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   But do me a favor.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.360]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.600]   When you try it, right there in the offer code and you'll get two free months if you

[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   Try carbonite.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.960]   You could try anything else you want.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.000]   It's so important nowadays.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.080]   Protect your business carbonite.com is what we do.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.800]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.880]   I think the ads on the show are increasingly about security and data privacy.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.360]   I wonder if that's indicative of the world we're in now.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.520]   It's not like Blue Apron.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   Try it out.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.520]   Your stuff will be stolen.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   Be sad.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.520]   Buy this now.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.520]   No Blue Apron today.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.880]   We still have the Blue Apron ads.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.120]   Ransomware stuff.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.600]   It is a happy news.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.640]   This is a good cheer us all up.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.880]   Apple is teaming up with cochlear.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.640]   You know, cochlear does these implants, right?
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.600]   They actually can help deaf people here.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.800]   I know a number of people with cochlear implants, it's remarkable.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:59.680]   Maybe you saw the video of the girl who'd never heard and she heard for the first time.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.200]   If you didn't cry, you got a heart of stone because it was amazing.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.880]   Apple is teaming up with cochlear.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.920]   They're going to make the first iPhone cochlear implant.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.840]   It will stream sound directly from a compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to the sound price
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:22.520]   processor, which then communicates with surgically embedded implants in your cochlea to help
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.000]   people who have never heard here again.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.600]   Vince Surf's wife was congenital death.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:33.960]   I remember talking to Vin about this father of the internet.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.600]   The day she heard his voice for the first time, can you imagine what that's like?
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.120]   No, actually I can't.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.000]   But is this just for sound hearing?
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.680]   To hear hearing, why does it need the iPhone when these work without smartphones?
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.680]   It doesn't.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.480]   It would use a microphone or something else on your hip.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.880]   As long as you've got a smartphone, why not use that for it as well?
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.720]   It's just to step forward using smartphones.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.840]   It's another way of...
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.440]   There have been in the past, in fact my hearing aids, my Star Keys use...
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.520]   I have an iOS app.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.760]   iOS has built into it in its accessibility features.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.520]   They have a made for iPhone hearing aids.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.880]   You can connect to that.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.760]   And actually it's actually pretty awesome.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.760]   That's cool.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:15.960]   If it calls me, if I want, I can go through the hearing aids so I can just talk to somebody.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.960]   I can listen to...
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:18.480]   Don't tell my wife this.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:23.600]   I can listen to audio books at dinner all the time.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.040]   You know this is recorded right?
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.520]   No, she's watching right now.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:32.040]   Actually I'll never forget the day that we wanted to hear like it was the World Series.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.040]   I remember when you...
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.440]   Are you guys old enough to remember going to school and listening to the World Series
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.760]   on a transverse radio?
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.760]   You probably aren't.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.520]   Oh my God, I'm so old.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:41.520]   No, not late.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.080]   If the Red Sox were playing in the World Series, which they weren't, but if they were, you
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.520]   would hope that the teacher didn't notice that you had a thing in your ear going down
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.360]   your shirt because you had a transistor radio so you could hear the game in school.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.440]   We did that with sweatshirts and vealed discments because you could thread the headphones through
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.440]   the inner pocket.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.440]   Okay, close enough.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.400]   If you could play the Lincoln Park album in sixth grade.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.400]   No, I don't do that.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.400]   It's my hearing aids.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.000]   I don't have to leave those in and I can...
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.280]   But so at one point, Lisa and I were trying to listen to something.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.440]   I led her my hearing aid and she could hear and I worked great.
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   It's amazing.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.440]   Prove the romance is still real.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.440]   That's true romance, man.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:15.440]   I'm a hearing aid.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.440]   Here you go.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.440]   Honey.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.960]   So I'm off first.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.080]   So there are things you get, a benefit you get.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.560]   I know with the hearing aids and I would guess this is true of the cochlear implant.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.640]   For instance, because the iPhone has GPS built in, you can set up different profiles.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.440]   So for a restaurant, you definitely want the hearing aid to do different things.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.560]   You don't want to amplify all that noise.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.640]   A movie sitting in your living room watching TV.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.840]   And so the phone can say, "Oh, I know where you are.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.720]   I will adjust your sound automatically."
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.480]   Actually, that was one of the reasons I thought it was so cool.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.480]   You also...
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.320]   It's a little easier to get than AirPods too.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.160]   Yeah, right.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.320]   I couldn't find AirPods.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.160]   I just got a cochlear implant instead.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.160]   I got surgery and said...
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.720]   Then Doppler Labs is making the AirPods equivalent.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:04.360]   It's like little AirPiece headphones that do the sound damping as well based on the environment
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360]   you're in.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360]   So this is probably where everything's going to go.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.360]   Absolutely.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360]   I like that.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360]   Absolutely.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.320]   When you get to be my age, you probably won't get hearing aids.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.080]   You'll just keep your earbuds in.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.080]   Right.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.760]   Well, if you just stay for your AirPods.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.920]   I thought that was actually the best possible use for an AirPod, right?
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.560]   And I was disappointed that battery life's not long enough.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.560]   It would kill it.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.680]   And there's legislation going through where they are not going to be medical devices anymore
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.120]   where you can just go to Target or something and buy them.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.560]   And that would be a game changer for the hearing aid industry and for companies like
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.560]   Doppler, for Apple.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.320]   Oh, can I tell you something?
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.000]   Uh, hearing aids, what a scam.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   $6,000.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   What?
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000]   Right.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]   Six mean come on.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   Really?
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.640]   Does it come with $5,000 in cash?
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.000]   Uh, well, I guess they figure everybody's insurance is paying for it or something.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.400]   Medical devices, it's a scam all around, right?
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.080]   So uh, Doppler Labs did those earbuds that weren't so good.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.080]   Was the dash?
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.080]   Was that the...
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.080]   Oh, that was broggy.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.080]   That's broggy.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.080]   So these are these better?
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.120]   I just know they're really cool.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.480]   I've tried them before.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.840]   It's cool how it can, uh, you know, filter out certain sounds and things like that.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.240]   Like in the office or a plane, but the battery life is terrible on them right now.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240]   See, that's the problem.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.000]   And they come just like the earpods with a case that has a battery in it.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.080]   But that's not, yeah, if you can only get half an hour, what was the battery like likes?
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.920]   Like three hours, maybe something like that.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:31.920]   Yeah, that's not awful.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.440]   It just means you can't wear them all the time.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440]   You have to.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440]   Right.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.440]   But I wear my earpods in like 30 minute bursts.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440]   Right.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440]   Me too.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.440]   All foods or the padega.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   On your...
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.440]   With a walk into the padega.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.440]   Why do you get actually the main use because I have?
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.440]   They don't sell cigarettes or something.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.040]   I think we need a musical theme.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:50.320]   Walk into the padega for Alex.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.240]   As long as you sing it, I'll dance to it.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.200]   You won't be able to get an iPod, Nano or a shuffle.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.760]   A shuffle has shuffled off the mortal coil apples, silently killed them on Thursday.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.880]   And now if you want an iPod, God knows why you would want an iPod.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.320]   If you want an iPod, you have to get a touch, which starts at 200 bucks.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.560]   I guess for kids, right?
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.560]   But everybody else is a phone.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560]   It's a starter device for the iPhone.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   Right.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.840]   If you're 10 years old and your parents don't want you to have a phone, it's great.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.840]   My first iPod.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.720]   I still want an iPod, to be honest.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:19.720]   I actually wish I...
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:24.000]   I found when I was looking for these headphones to come on here, I found the thing that these
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.880]   were attached to, which was an iPod classic from like a decade ago.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.000]   And it's a work anymore because who has those like big connectors?
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]   But I kind of...
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   It's a 30 pin connector.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]   Yeah, I forgot the number.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.160]   But like, you know, I kind of liked that I had a device that just had 80 gigabytes of
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.200]   music and I didn't have to like, you know, stream over my expensive data connection to
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.840]   like listen to every piece of music I ever revolved.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.040]   Oh, why would you want to do that?
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.480]   How many songs is 80 gigs?
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.240]   I totally forget the so version.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.400]   So I, when they killed the classic, which was a few years ago, that was the 160 gig
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.560]   iPod.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.480]   I bought one because I thought this is it.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.480]   It's over.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:08.240]   I have 260 gig iPod classics, but I don't ever use them because as I, you know, I've got
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.280]   my phone, even for audio books and I can get enough music on a 128 gig iPhone.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.360]   I don't need to really worry about ever worry about an iPod.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]   What?
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.200]   My phone's all full of photos.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.200]   John, you want to...
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.400]   I already gave it to my mom.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.400]   I put all...
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.760]   I put all my music on one and I put all my audio books on another and I said it to my
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.920]   mom.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920]   She has a dock.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:32.920]   She still has a dock.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.920]   She's two docks.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.040]   She got a tower speaker with a dock in it so she can listen to music and iPhones.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.040]   I'm sorry, John.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.040]   I would have given it to you, but my mother carried me for nine months.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.080]   What have you done lately?
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:48.600]   Got me a cup of coffee.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.600]   That's okay.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:55.720]   No, I, yeah, I agree with, I'm kind of with you, Mike.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.920]   These will become fetish and there are a lot of people upset about the loss of the nano
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.920]   and they shuffle.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.680]   If you go to the gym, a lot of people wearing nano's.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:04.080]   They should have bought more of them and Apple wouldn't have canceled them.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.440]   You don't, yeah, that's maybe that's true.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.520]   You don't want to wear it.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:10.200]   I do see people wearing phones on their biceps.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.720]   That's not a good look.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:12.720]   Why is that?
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.720]   It's not a good look.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.720]   Why is it not a good look?
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   Well, I don't know.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   I know.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   Right?
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.080]   Like it's the size of my face.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:21.760]   Like it's too big for my non muscular arms.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.400]   Well, that's why you're going to the gym, Mike.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.880]   You can come with us, man.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:26.880]   Beef them up.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:29.440]   Yeah, I have one of those straps, but look it.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.040]   Unless you had a smaller phone, this is the seven plus.
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.240]   Mike's absolutely right.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.600]   But I don't care if I look dumb in the gym though.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:36.600]   I'm already sweating.
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.600]   You're already like dumb.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.600]   You're right.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   You're already like dumb.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600]   It's like awkward.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:46.440]   Like when I used to be able to run, I strapped my six plus or, yeah, six plus, I guess.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.280]   And it just felt weird.
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:50.520]   You know, like it's such a big thing on your arm.
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:51.520]   I don't know.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:54.720]   Like back in the day when I had an iPod nano or whatever, that was fine.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.720]   And they're great for runners.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:59.200]   And Apple's like argument now is, oh, just get an Apple watch.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.000]   Even though that is like not the best device, right?
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.120]   And they want you to wear it all the time, but actually it's only a device for, you know,
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.240]   using when you're working out.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.680]   Like, I can't square that circle and maybe it would be easier if you just still sold
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:10.680]   a music player.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.240]   Well, I think that's what we kind of concluded was that Apple would prefer that you bought
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.600]   a watch, but who wants to get a watch?
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.320]   And this only has a four gigs of storage.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.520]   I mean, I guess four gigs.
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.360]   You can put four gigs of music on.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.520]   Well, I mean, how long do you work out?
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.960]   Very high bit rates on the actual answer to that question.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:31.960]   Oh, OK.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.960]   No, I don't know.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:35.320]   But I mean, four gigs of songs, I feel like if I put them on shuffle and I worked out,
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.240]   you know, for two weeks of that playlist, I would get super bored of it.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.880]   Well, then you just I don't want to update my watch.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:41.880]   Come on.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.320]   Like, I don't go home and think like what's more stuff I can do with my devices today?
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.320]   My Mac prefers actually off.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:52.080]   Actually, didn't you, Mike, wrote a article saying, why would anybody want to play in
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.080]   Apple?
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.080]   Why this was last year, I think?
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:57.480]   Yeah, that was that was something I wrote that Apple has made.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.880]   I mean, their feelings very clear about.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.360]   Oh, you're not getting invited to events anymore either, huh?
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.760]   I finally do.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.960]   But they told me that the reason I didn't was.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.960]   What?
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.720]   They told you that that was see, they've always denied.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.000]   There's a blacklist, but they said to you were not going to.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000]   Oh, there's definitely a blacklist.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000]   Oh, there's a black list.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   We were on.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]   I was on the blacklist for a while.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.640]   There's always a black list.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:23.560]   So I have been invited to an Apple event since the iPad announcement in 2010 when I everybody
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:24.880]   was doing it.
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.200]   They all these cameras behind me.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.800]   I turned my laptop around and I streamed it.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.280]   Oh, yeah, that's a big no.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.480]   But Steve saw me and he looked at me and I swear to God, he went.
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.840]   And I never got another invitation.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.320]   But I think that that was just, you know, chance.
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.480]   This is so much chance.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.360]   Apple's press events are not left to chance.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:50.040]   So I would really like to go see the new spaceship campus.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.600]   And I'm hoping that I can get an invite to the September iPhone 10th anniversary event
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   for old time's sake.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]   What do you say, Mike?
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   Let's go.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   Let's call them up.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600]   Let's say, come on.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.600]   Nice.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600]   Come on.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.960]   What's the statute of limitations?
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960]   Come on.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.960]   You want to call them up?
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.960]   Yeah, I feel like I'm probably getting uninvited right now from the next one.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:09.960]   No, no, no.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960]   I don't know him.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.960]   Mike is not.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:13.960]   We're not friends.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:14.960]   We're not friends.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.960]   It's okay.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:16.960]   We're not friends.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.840]   So, but I mentioned I had a story about the Atlantic.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.680]   I mean about courts because wasn't courts a spin off of Atlantic?
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.680]   It's still part of the Atlantic media.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.680]   Are you?
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:31.280]   And that is now a very confusing term as of Friday at 3 a.m.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:37.080]   Because Lorraine Powell Jobs, and I don't want to be the guy who says Steve Jobs widow,
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:42.280]   but I guess I better, wonder, by the way, wonderful person.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.720]   Really really admire her.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.080]   She has a group she calls the Emerson collective named after Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.600]   So now you know she's an intellectual.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.360]   Turns out Ralph Waldo Emerson created the Atlantic.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   Did you know that?
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360]   I did not know.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   He was actually a finance year.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.440]   I looked into this.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.640]   He was not a founder.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.640]   He put money up, which, you know, kind of interesting what the Emerson collective does,
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   right?
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.760]   So she's put a, she has a little bit of money.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.560]   Steve, Steve had a retirement account and she put a little bit of that money into buying
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.880]   the Atlantic from, yeah.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.120]   So is she now your boss?
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:25.440]   So it's an interesting structure and a bunch of the articles actually that one was right,
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.400]   but a bunch of them were wrong.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:32.440]   And Lorraine Powell Jobs now has the controlling share of the Atlantic magazine.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.440]   Ah, but not the.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.840]   The Atlantic Media Group, which contains the magazine, she has no sharing.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:43.280]   So she has no sharing in the courts, government executive, national journal, all of that stuff.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.760]   So David Bradley is still very much our owner for as far as I know ever.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:49.760]   Interesting.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.400]   She's, Lorraine has $20 billion.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.200]   She's the number one, at least I think maybe they sold their stake, but she was the number
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.040]   one shareholder in Disney.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.520]   Wow.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.080]   And she apparently owns a Hollywood studio.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:10.000]   She's supported ProPublica and the Marshall Project.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.400]   So she's very apparently interested in media.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:20.640]   And when she was asked at the Code Conference last May, if she would ever consider buying
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:23.760]   something like The New York Times, she said, "Is it for sale?"
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.240]   I wish I had that kind of money.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:30.480]   This is not unprecedented.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:36.400]   Chris Hughes, Facebook millionaire, briefly owned and almost killed the New Republic,
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.040]   the New Republic, which I love, but I think it was, he was not a good steward.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.640]   Of course, Jeff Bezos, currently owns a post and has done, I think, a very good job.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.880]   And what did Kushner buy?
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.360]   He bought the New York Observer-
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.360]   The Observer-
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:48.360]   Yeah, and sold it.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.960]   Oh, he doesn't know.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:50.960]   He does.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.960]   He's not involved in it anymore.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.960]   He got rid of it.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:54.960]   So I love the Atlantic.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:56.400]   I think the Atlantic is fantastic.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.120]   Me too.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.240]   And I hope that she keep, I think she will keep it.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.200]   You had to say that, didn't you?
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.000]   There's definitely no one right outside the frame saying.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.400]   And it's not really the Atlantic.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.160]   It's no longer related, right?
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.480]   Well, it's an odd structure which I meant to ask, but it was a big day.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.480]   So the big thing-
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   No, I think it'll be fine.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.160]   The big thing about the Atlantic, and I've really admired the Atlantic, is they, a lot
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:25.920]   of older publications do not handle the digital transition well.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.800]   The Atlantic, of all of them, maybe even better than the New York Times, has done an excellent
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.800]   job.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.720]   I see Atlantic articles in a lot of my feeds.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.600]   I refer to them a lot.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.800]   I think they've done a very good job of keeping James Fallow's rights for them.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:45.800]   They get a very good job of staying relevant in the digital age, even though they're 160
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.800]   years old.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:49.560]   They're all in the field where airport buys.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.520]   And whenever a game of thrones is over, I go immediately to like to figure out what
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.760]   the hell just happened.
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:59.080]   That's by the way, that is the new form of journalism that I like.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.560]   The round tables discussing shows on HBO or Netflix or-
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.760]   We just launched one of those for Game of Thrones that we're doing every Monday called
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760]   Joffrey's Place.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.760]   Oh, I love it.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.840]   It's on Quartz?
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.840]   Are you in there?
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:13.840]   Yeah, it's on.
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.000]   I was actually on last week, even though I've watched the show like twice, and I don't
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000]   get it.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.760]   So they take someone, they make someone watch an episode every week ago.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]   What happened?
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.760]   And you're supposed to like make it out and figure it out.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.240]   So I did that this week.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.520]   But yeah, it's awesome.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:31.200]   Like that's a thing we're doing, and we're doing it for Game of Thrones, and I think probably,
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:35.800]   you know, with our awesome TV writer, Adam Epstein, probably do more stuff like that.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.520]   Is it a podcast only?
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.720]   It's on our Facebook page.
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:44.160]   Actually, I think it's on our new Facebook page, Quartzy, which is our new like lifestyle
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.160]   section.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.920]   But last week's was on the Quartz Facebook page as well.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.640]   Yeah, because I don't see it on the Cusie.com.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:51.640]   Quartzy.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.640]   No, this is the wrong Quartzy.
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:53.640]   This is definitely the wrong Quartzy.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.640]   How do you spell Quartzy?
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.640]   He's not the right person.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.640]   He's not the right person.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.640]   He's not the right person.
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.640]   Oh, hi.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.400]   No, I'm in the right place.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.120]   Is it an orange logo?
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:03.120]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.440]   No, you know, that company, that's so weird.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:11.560]   I was reporting a story in Wisconsin, middle of nowhere, the story on self-driving trucks
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.240]   that went up like a couple weeks ago.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.120]   But I got off the interstate.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.760]   There's just this giant billboard saying Quartzy.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.600]   I'm like, they knew I was coming.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.400]   But apparently it's another company.
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:25.680]   Well, I can do what everybody does when you can't find something on Facebook, Apple,
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.680]   anywhere.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.680]   You Google it.
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.760]   Joffrey's place, that is a great picture.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.120]   We'll be starting shortly.
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:34.120]   So they do it as a Facebook live stream.
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:38.200]   Yeah, it's like a roundtable just like this, but only on Game of Thrones.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.200]   Wow.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.400]   I hate it, but I would totally watch that.
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.760]   Well, it's really good.
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:47.040]   I'll be honest, I'll watch and this happened with House of Cards too, but Game of Thrones
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.200]   especially, I will watch it.
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:53.320]   And I spent a lot of time going, I feel like an old man though.
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.320]   Who's he?
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320]   What is he doing?
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.320]   Who's that?
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.120]   Why did he kill him?
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.120]   What?
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:00.880]   She's who?
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.400]   A lot.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:05.720]   And so I need these things, these explainers.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:10.160]   And then I'll read it and go, oh, oh.
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:14.440]   Here's in the Atlantic, Leanna Mormont in the slogan feminism of Game of Thrones.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:19.480]   See, this is exactly, this is, this is exactly, there's stuff going on in these shows.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:24.520]   I just don't like, Lea, this, I didn't even know this is who, Leanna Mormont.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.480]   She's a little kid, but she's like talking like a grownup.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:33.320]   She's like, let's go, I, you're his, and it's like, who is this little kid and why?
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.480]   She's from Bear Island, right?
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:35.480]   Yeah, she's from Bear Island.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.880]   Oh, I love that character.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:37.880]   Yeah, she's amazing.
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.280]   She bullies around all the cowardly old men and it's great.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.280]   And then it helps like John Swell.
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.640]   So that way he can get together with Kaleesi and take over Westeros and Kelsarowski.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:47.640]   Come on.
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.920]   And you say you've never seen this show?
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.360]   Oh, I've seen all of it.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360]   500 times.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360]   I've never seen it.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.360]   And so this is all just gibberish.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.560]   Yeah, my, no, I've seen it and it's gibberish.
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:00.240]   Too many characters.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.000]   Our brain isn't wired to think that way.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000]   I can't.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000]   That's why this content has to exist.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.800]   Okay, but I can't take politics all day and I need to have some things I do during the
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.280]   week that are just non politics.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:17.120]   Cheat Lea on a Mormont, according to the Atlantic, is just the video personification
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:20.760]   of the fearless girl statue on Wall Street.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.760]   I think that's actually true.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.760]   Okay.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:32.160]   Well, see, these are the cultural connections that these, this new kind of form of media
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.640]   does I love.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:40.480]   Donald Trump says Apple has promised, promised to build three manufacturing plants, plants
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:44.200]   in the US, Apple declined to comment.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.280]   Nor did they say where or when these plants would be, what they would do, who they would
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.520]   hire.
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.120]   And then Foxconn made an announcement.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:54.120]   And then Foxconn, which is not Apple, but does assemble the iPhone, said, we're going to
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:57.080]   be the plant in Wisconsin to make sharp televisions.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:00.960]   If you're a person who thinks that Amazon owns the Washington Post, don't you think
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.760]   you can make a mistake about Apple owns Foxconn?
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.760]   I think that's what I think happened.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.160]   He thinks Foxconn is Apple and he hurts that Foxconn makes iPhone.
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.760]   So he just assumed it was an Apple factory.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.760]   That's probably what it was.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.880]   Can you imagine?
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.880]   The Apple executive suite reading this tweet going, what?
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:21.880]   Did you?
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:27.720]   Did I read Tim slowly scrolling up like, why?
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.280]   So let's talk about the campus.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.360]   Very, you know, there've been great articles, Stephen Levy's article in Wired, the most
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:39.320]   recent in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, how Johnny I've massed to minded Apple's new
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:41.120]   headquarters.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.960]   And you read along, oh, I got to log in to read it, but you read along and, and I actually
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.120]   pay for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.480]   So I could do that, but I don't have my UB key with me and it's a long story.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.480]   But anyway, there you go.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.640]   Got it.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:55:00.120]   If you read along pretty soon, there's a little trouble in paradise because it's apparently
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.080]   there's no really for the programmer's offices.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.760]   There's big tables and even meetings are held.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:11.360]   Everybody's, and there's not enough whiteboards and even already some people are saying, this
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.320]   is not good.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:17.920]   So this is an example of what happens when you say, you know, you empower a master designer
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.080]   like Johnny, I just do whatever you think's best.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.120]   And Johnny goes, okay.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.920]   It turns out industrial design and interior design are not the exact same discipline.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:32.560]   Well, and it's interesting because Johnny says, I don't think of this as architecture.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:35.120]   I think of it as a product.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.120]   That's a bad sign.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.120]   That is a bad sign.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.120]   It is a bad sign.
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:39.120]   I think Mike's right.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.320]   Like that level of pretension is between a vomit and their own hands.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:45.200]   Yeah, Peter Rams never built a building for a reason.
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.520]   He didn't know what he was doing.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.240]   But the broader point about open workspaces or we call open floor plans in Silicon Valley,
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:55.760]   being the bane of programmers is actually too small of a point in my view.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.480]   I think it's the bane for all of us.
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:59.400]   I mean, I work in an office right now.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:00.400]   There it is.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.040]   This is what it's going to look like when you come into work.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.040]   That looks like hell.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:04.040]   It's an Apple store.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:05.040]   It's an Apple store.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.040]   It's like an Apple store.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.680]   It's like Apple store and Dilbert got together.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:09.680]   It's just terrible.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:10.680]   I don't like it there.
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.160]   The building from the outside.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.160]   Amazing.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.760]   But let's talk about the larger issue because I think you're right.
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.180]   I think that one of the problems about working in a company at this point is there are some
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:24.640]   people who don't want to work and they don't want you to work because you're making them
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:30.000]   look bad and those people will go around from cubicle to cubicle bugging you so that
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.200]   you can't get anything done.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.840]   It's really hard if you're a programmer.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.480]   Your mind is focused.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.480]   Or a writer.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.040]   You probably have the same exact issue.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.280]   You're really in the zone.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:43.520]   And then somebody says, "So what do you think of them bears?"
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:44.520]   Transplant nuts.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.520]   Must be very hard.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.200]   Nobody dares do that here.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.520]   We're working here, John.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.520]   Or let's...
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.520]   Oh, it's time for a meeting.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:55.520]   That's my favorite.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.160]   There's an hour lost forever.
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.160]   Into the void.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:02.680]   But I think everyone suffers from open floor plans, not just programmers.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:04.840]   So I think that Apple made it really serious mistake here.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:05.840]   You can't solve it with cubicle walls.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:07.640]   You need actual walls with actual doors.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.560]   Now we're not going to get invited to that.
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.680]   I would take a 30% pay cut if I had a door.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:13.240]   We're screwed, Mike.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:15.080]   I like my open floor plan.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.880]   There's still my only one.
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:17.880]   It's a great idea.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:18.880]   I want to hear about it.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:19.880]   I want to hear about it.
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.880]   Especially...
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.560]   I mean, I work in a newsroom and I love being able to just shout and collaborate.
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.560]   Aren't they traditionally like that?
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.560]   Right?
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:28.560]   The chronicles.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:30.400]   It's so you can go copy.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.120]   And the copy boy comes and takes your...
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.120]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.120]   Wrong.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:35.120]   We don't have this.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.120]   There's no copy boys.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:37.120]   There's no copy boys.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:38.120]   There's no copy editors.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.400]   Clearly there's not even any copy editors anymore.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.160]   So I'll tell my copy editor.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.160]   No, I think you're...
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:48.760]   And I think that that's actually the thinking behind this Apple floor plan is that communication.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:52.160]   He says I want people to look at each other and talk to each other.
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:55.160]   But it can be antithetical to production productivity, right?
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.640]   Now for a programmer, is that good?
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.200]   Maybe not.
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:02.080]   Not every job is collaborative in that sense.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.560]   So yeah, I can see that being annoying.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:04.800]   I like my open floor plan.
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:05.800]   So I love it.
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:09.680]   Microsoft has offices for every single engineer.
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:10.680]   They have an app.
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.680]   Microsoft office?
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:13.880]   Yeah, private office.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.480]   So does what?
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.120]   Why are they laughing?
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.680]   Microsoft office.
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:19.680]   Microsoft office.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:24.920]   I thought they were laughing because I forced them to sit in an open floor plan.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:28.200]   But like I think that's a fair point, right?
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.480]   Especially given what Apple's history is, I mean, you know, Brian Merchant just wrote
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.520]   that great book about the first iPhone and how it was built.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:43.360]   And they, you know, they hit everyone in an office offsite and couldn't talk about it.
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.840]   And they all had to live in a room where they like locked the doors.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.560]   And now they're an open plan office company.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.560]   That doesn't make any sense.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:51.920]   It's antithetical to their own way that they've always worked.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:55.040]   Open plan is how you get news traveling.
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.120]   And obviously in a newsroom, that's awesome.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:00.960]   I like my open plan office for my newsroom that I work in.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:06.680]   But if I were at Apple and I had the developers from one section working on something and perhaps,
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:11.280]   you know, cross contaminating with another section, that might actually be really detrimental
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:17.160]   to not only productivity, but, you know, secrecy, which they absolutely, you know, value.
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:23.320]   Well, they do have, to be fair, on the campus that an R&D building, there's a separate
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.760]   building that probably has good security.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:29.480]   And that's probably where the new stuff, I don't think Apple's going to abandon its
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.480]   secrecy.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.480]   But it's not going to be a big thing.
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:32.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:33.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:35.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:36.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:38.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:40.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:42.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:43.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:44.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:46.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:47.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:56.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:04.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:07.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:12.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:16.480]   It's going to be a big thing.
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:21.480]   It was still a building set.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:24.480]   That was right when Stephen Levy's piece went up.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:29.480]   You're seeing these beautiful, cruelly CJI photos because I'm there.
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:35.480]   I'm like, "There's still those weird chain mail fences up saying building site hard hat area only."
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:39.480]   It sucks if you have to go to work and make sure you don't go in the hard hat entrance.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:43.480]   That's like half a soma though.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:45.480]   Half a soma is under construction at any given time.
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:47.480]   It's not too different.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:49.480]   Half a New York is too.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:50.480]   That's true.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.480]   That's why New York is the worst.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:54.480]   Joel Spolsky, we've had him on triangulation.
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:58.480]   He's a great guy, created Stack Overflow, a great programmer.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:02.480]   He says, "Just shut up and let your devs concentrate."
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:04.480]   It's article in Geekwire.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.480]   Somebody in the chatroom passed this along.
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   He was talking about Facebook's campus.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:14.480]   He says, "It's an eight acre open room and Facebook was very pleased with itself for building what it thought was this amazing place for developers.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.480]   But developers don't want to overhear conversations.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.480]   That's ideal for a trading floor.
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.480]   Developers need to concentrate to go to a chatroom and ask questions to get the answers later.
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:32.480]   Facebook is paying 40 to 50% more than other places, which is usually a sign developers don't want to work there.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:33.480]   Ooh.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.480]   [chuckles]
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.480]   Or maybe they can just afford it.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:39.480]   All right, we're going to talk about DEF CON.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:40.480]   We come back.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:41.480]   Did you go?
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.480]   Did anybody go to DEF CON?
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.480]   You guys have been covering it, I'm sure.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:46.480]   I've been watching the Insane Badge tweets for the last couple days.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:50.480]   All right, we'll talk about the Insane Badge, the robot that can crack safes.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.480]   Yes.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:58.480]   And some other news from the Hacker, the big Hacker Conference, but first a word from WordPress.com.
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:01.480]   Do you know that 28% of all websites run on WordPress?
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.480]   28%.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:07.480]   Quartz, I believe, is one of those websites.
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:09.480]   It is indeed.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:10.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:11.480]   WordPress.
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:12.480]   My blog on WordPress.
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.480]   Now I used WordPress, self-hosted WordPress for years for most of the 2000s.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:18.480]   This is my blog.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:21.480]   And I moved recently to WordPress.com and I'm so thrilled.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.480]   First of all, they keep it up to date.
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.480]   They keep it secure.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:26.480]   They make sure everything's working.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:32.480]   They've got great 24/7 support with smart people who are friendly and nice and helpful.
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.480]   They really make it easy to make a great site.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:37.480]   But they also have a community.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.480]   When you go to the WordPress.com front page, you'll see websites highlighted.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:44.480]   You'll see people talking.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.480]   They've put my site up there from time to time.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.480]   I have half a million people now following me.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:52.480]   That's a community I wouldn't have had if I weren't on WordPress.com.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:53.480]   I love WordPress.com.
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:56.480]   It is the best platform whether you want to create a personal blog.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480]   That's what I do.
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:00.480]   But it's great for your business site or both.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:05.480]   You're going to make a big impact when you build your website on WordPress.com.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.480]   Pick a template.
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.480]   It's about as easy as it is possible.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.480]   If you just click the Get Started button, they'll give you a simple starting point and you just
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.480]   start going and you'll see how easy it is.
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:20.480]   But as you get more sophisticated and you want more, they have hundreds of templates.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480]   You get built-in search engine optimization.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480]   You don't even have to know what that means.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.480]   You just get it social sharing.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.480]   Your posts can show up on Facebook, on Twitter, everywhere.
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:34.480]   In fact, there's an AMP plugin which I turned on so my stuff loads fast on mobile.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.480]   You automatically get secure HTTP/HTTPS which helps your ranking on Google and make sure
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:40.480]   your site is secure.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:41.480]   It's all built-in.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.480]   And you're part of a community.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.480]   And I love that too.
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:48.480]   See why more websites run on WordPress than any other platform.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.480]   28% of that.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:52.480]   And a lot of very big publications too.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.480]   WordPress.com/twit gets started today with 15% of any new plan purchase.
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:02.480]   WordPress.com/twit.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.480]   I have to say, I blog more.
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:06.480]   I'm really happy to be back on WordPress.
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.480]   Everything just makes sense to me.
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:09.480]   It's very intuitive.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.480]   And we've used it so much.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.480]   I mean, we've written thousands of pieces on WordPress right now.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.480]   Yeah.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:17.480]   Go back, what's BI on?
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.480]   We have a custom CMS.
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.480]   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.480]   I love it.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:24.480]   Yeah, it's really stable.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:25.480]   It's really custom.
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:30.480]   I remember when Vox did theirs, everybody said that's a reason to go to work for Vox.
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.480]   It's a business.
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:32.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:34.480]   Now ours is called Viking.
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:35.480]   Viking?
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.480]   It's called Vikings?
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:38.480]   Manly and scary.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:39.480]   Okay.
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:43.320]   The reason these guys care is because when you write your articles, you write it in the content
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.480]   management system, right?
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:45.480]   Usually.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.480]   You fire up Notepad, write it and paste it.
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:48.480]   No, no, no, no.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.480]   You write it, write it in the sounds.
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.480]   Yeah.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:55.000]   It depends on if it's something longer, like it's a longer profile or, you know, something
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.560]   that I'm working on for a long time and I'll do it in Google Docs first just because I'm
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:59.560]   scared.
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:01.160]   That'll get lost somewhere.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.960]   But for quick, you know, one-off stories, yeah, right in the CMS.
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:08.640]   If it's more than like 1500 words, all right in G Docs with an outline.
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.440]   If it's less than that in CMS, just like stream of consciousness.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.280]   There's all the links and all the images, everything.
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:14.280]   You just put it in there.
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.280]   It's just a natural.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.280]   You know, if it's a good CMS, it works.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:18.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:19.280]   Very nice.
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:22.480]   I really want to play the chorus, but no one from Vox will let me play with that.
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:23.480]   That's out there.
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:26.480]   So, you know, I have a feeling I should, you should ask a year later because everybody loves
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.480]   Slack.
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:30.080]   Until it became the biggest time sink in history, right?
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.480]   Do you guys have Slack here?
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:32.480]   No.
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:33.480]   No Slack.
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:36.120]   We use HipChat, which doesn't have animated GIFs.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.360]   It doesn't have the Alex Trebek robot.
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:39.360]   It doesn't.
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.360]   So it's boring Slack.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:47.720]   We used Slack with our development team when we did the website and I typed, "That's nice."
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:50.440]   And a Borat shows up going, "That's nice."
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.960]   And it's like, "Stop it!"
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.000]   Stop trying to make me fun and playful in a work environment.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.960]   I'm trying to get work done.
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:01.560]   So I want a correction here, not that I ever made the mistake, but the folks at Roomba
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:05.280]   said, "We never said we're going to sell your data."
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:10.240]   The Roomba vacuum, which maps your, or has the capability, I guess the room is the 900,
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:12.400]   the new one, has the capability of making a map.
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:15.960]   That's helpful because, for instance, when the Roomba runs out of power, goes back to
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:20.200]   its battery, you can pick up where it left off because it knows your house.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:25.280]   People were really up in arms because it's CEO implied in an interview with Reuters that
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:30.400]   at some point they wanted to sell that mapping data to third parties.
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.280]   First of all, at the time, it didn't bother me that much.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:38.960]   Who cares where my, somebody else knows where my sofa is in relationship to my table lamp?
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.760]   Like what?
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:47.920]   And people stretched, "Well, a burglar would then be able to bring your house and go swiftly."
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:51.720]   People stretched, I mean, I understand it's private and you probably should control it
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:55.440]   and Roomba did say, "We wouldn't sell it unless you said it was okay.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.560]   We aren't doing it now.
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:59.080]   But they backed off completely now."
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.040]   They said, "It's not going to happen.
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.200]   That was a misunderstanding.
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:06.480]   We currently don't sell your data and we never intend to sell your data."
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.680]   What we were thinking and maybe we won't do it now that we know is we would share that
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:11.680]   data.
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:16.280]   Well, for instance, with other smart devices in your house, the Echo would love to know
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:21.240]   where there's furniture so that it would help shape the mic.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:26.120]   Your stereo system could shape the sound, the Apple Home Hub, which says it will shape
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:28.120]   the sound based on your Roomba's acoustics.
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:29.840]   It would be nice for it to know.
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:30.840]   There's something here.
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:31.840]   There's something there.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:32.840]   Sure.
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.440]   I can understand that being of value.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:37.400]   I don't know who else would want to know where your sofa is.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:45.880]   Maybe if you're Ikea, you'd want to know how big is too big or if you're an interior
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.880]   designer, how do people like to...
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:50.840]   There's easier ways to get that than through Roomba.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:51.840]   Yeah.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.840]   Yeah.
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:55.240]   Also, how many houses, what percentage of houses actually own a Roomba?
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:57.320]   And then they have to get the data, sell it somehow.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:01.400]   And then it has to be leaked and then leaked to burglars who then figured out pinpoint
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:03.640]   your house and you haven't moved.
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:04.800]   And then they break in and they don't have a cash.
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:08.360]   They still don't know how fancy your TV or sofa is, just that there's a sofa there.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.040]   Or if you have a security in the house.
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:11.040]   Right.
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:12.040]   Or if they don't have a room.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:13.040]   It's not even all of the Roombas.
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.320]   It was only the 900 series, which is their most expensive one.
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:19.720]   So all of these headlines are like Roombas, your robot is stealing your data.
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:25.240]   And it's like, how many people actually have those $800 super mapping robot vacuums?
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:26.240]   Not the like two dollars.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.360]   I had one and I got rid of it because...
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:32.240]   So my Roomba, this is the most annoying thing you could think of.
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:34.960]   It would not get back to the charger.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.960]   So it would die midway.
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:36.960]   I don't know.
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:37.960]   Right?
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:38.960]   Okay.
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:41.400]   So you wake up in the morning, there's a Roomba in the middle of the carpet.
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:42.400]   The dog did something.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.920]   So you pick up the Roomba and it has a handle and you put it back on the charger.
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:49.520]   But what I didn't know was the Roomba forgets date and time then.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.960]   And any programming.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.080]   So you programmed the Roomba to work when you're a worker, not when you're not at three in
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.560]   the morning.
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:02.040]   So the Roomba makes a racket when it plays a tune when it wakes up.
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:11.480]   And then invariably my Roomba used to, for some reason, try to get under the hutch that
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:13.120]   they can't fit under.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:17.760]   So it would get jammed and then that's my dear three in the morning.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.520]   And I go, "Oh, da da da da da!"
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.200]   And then boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:30.000]   It's all I got up and said, "No Roomba."
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.160]   And put it back on the charger.
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:35.440]   This is the definition, by the way, of a first world problem.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.440]   Okay, I admit.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.160]   And I say that with love because my sister has a Roomba whenever I'm down at her house
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:42.280]   in San Francisco, it does that to the 6 a.m.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.280]   It's so annoying.
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:46.080]   It wakes me up and I want to kick it, but I'm also trying to sleep.
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:50.360]   So I finally took the Roomba and my wife found them.
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:55.120]   I wedged them on the rear tires of the car in the garage hoping she would accidentally
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.520]   drive over them.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.960]   But she unfortunately found them before she did that and gave them away.
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.320]   They're easier ways to whack your Roomba.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:07.040]   I know, but I was really, "Oh shoot, the Roomba got stuck under your tire."
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.160]   Oh, what a sad story.
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:11.480]   I mean, just, all right.
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:18.760]   She still talks longingly and wistfully about when we used to have a Roomba.
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:20.880]   I don't understand it.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:21.880]   Defcon.
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:22.880]   Yes.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.000]   Anyway, I just wanted everybody not to worry about the Roomba.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.320]   On the other hand, there is a robot that can crack a safe and did it on the Defcon stage
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.640]   in 30 minutes.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.280]   It was one of those sentry safes that everybody probably has, you know, and it's a cheap safe.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.280]   They built the robot.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.280]   Spark Fund did it.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:43.240]   All the products that they used to build a robot like our JUinos and Raspberry Pi's.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:46.080]   It's 3D design.
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:48.560]   They didn't bring the safe to Vegas.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.120]   It wasn't a special safe.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.800]   They bought one in a store because they didn't want to take it on the airplane.
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:56.920]   The Roomba.
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:02.960]   The repurposed Roomba was able to figure out, to eliminate, because there's a million possibilities,
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:08.400]   but they were able to narrow it down to a thousand because apparently a nice convenience
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:13.480]   factor sentry safe puts a little notch on some of the numbers so you can, I guess, I
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.000]   don't know why, but they found that within 30 minutes they were able to open up that safe.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.960]   They said we were really happy that it opened up.
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:21.560]   It was one of the scariest things we've ever done.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.040]   Lots of things could go wrong.
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.800]   This was a very big audience.
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:28.040]   That's why Defcon is cool because we didn't try stuff that may fail.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.760]   It's not like an Apple event that we discussed earlier.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.440]   It's so practiced, rehearsed, and slick.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:35.680]   This is nerds on stage with wires going everywhere.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:36.680]   I felt this thing.
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.680]   Exactly.
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:38.680]   That's what I was talking about.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:39.680]   $200.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:40.680]   It's 3D printed.
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.960]   You can print different parts to fit any combination safe.
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:50.240]   I don't imagine this is a threat that burglars will bring the director sets around with them.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:51.720]   What are you doing there, sir?
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:52.720]   Absolutely.
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:54.560]   This is totally unsuspicious.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:12:00.440]   More to the point, Ian Thompson's article and the register, it took Defcon hackers minutes
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:06.120]   to pwn actual voting machines that were used in the last US election.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:08.480]   These are electronic voting machines from Debold.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:14.280]   We've known those who've had security issues, but also WinVote.
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:19.920]   One other company, I'm going to try to find this, the WinVote system still had the information
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:25.800]   it was used in an election in the Commonwealth of Virginia, county of Fairfax Special Election.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:30.320]   This one was really easy to hack because it had Wi-Fi.
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:31.320]   It had Wi-Fi.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.080]   Why would a voting machine have Wi-Fi?
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:35.080]   You might ask.
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:36.680]   Well, it's so good surf the internet.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:38.480]   I don't know.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.480]   Upload the votes.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:40.480]   Upload the votes.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:41.880]   It just sounds big about it.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:46.600]   And as long as you're running Wi-Fi, you might as well run Windows XP.
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:47.600]   No.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.600]   Yes.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:49.600]   Yes.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.720]   So they used RDP, a well-known flaw in Windows XP.
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:56.520]   They used a Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol just to hack right into that thing.
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.360]   No problem.
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.360]   There were bugs.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:02.040]   Some of them were running OpenSSL, Unpatched OpenSSL.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.000]   So they used, some were running Windows CE.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.400]   Some had physical ports, Ethernet Jax or USB ports you could just plug into.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:16.000]   But my favorite is this WinVote machine from the Fairfax County Special Election.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.760]   Are we surprised these were so insecure?
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:20.480]   I feel like I'm kind of nodding my head going like, "Yep, there it is.
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:21.480]   Oh, XP.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:22.480]   Yep, real dumb.
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:28.320]   One minute and 40 seconds later, Carsten Sherman had remote access to this voting machine.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.320]   Oh my gosh.
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:30.320]   Yep.
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:35.120]   It was running Windows XP with auto run enabled.
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.520]   And it had the hard-coded password.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.520]   Oh my gosh.
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:40.920]   It was a hard-coded web password.
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:42.640]   So first of all, web's crackable.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:44.440]   But the password is hard-coded.
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:47.800]   So if you learned it for one machine, you knew it for all.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:48.800]   Wow.
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:51.640]   This is an argument against democracy, I feel.
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:52.640]   Yeah.
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:55.840]   But good news, intrusion would have been detected and logged.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:56.840]   Okay.
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.560]   But actually the better news is this kind of information is really valuable in convincing
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.320]   registrars all over the country not to use electronic voting machines with no paper
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.680]   trail because there's no way to validate the votes and probably not have them connected
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:11.680]   to the Internet.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:12.680]   That'd be special.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:14.680]   The hard-coded web password.
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:15.680]   I mean, Google.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.680]   On.
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:18.320]   What else?
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:21.720]   Injecting code into mouse firmware?
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.600]   You couldn't tell those euphemism or not.
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.840]   Is this genetics or is this like a mouse I'm plugging into my PC?
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:30.920]   They added their own.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.920]   This is at the Saturday morning talk.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:36.320]   Mark Williams and Rob Stanley walked through the process of adding their own custom code
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:37.320]   to a gaming mouse.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.320]   Oh.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:40.320]   That's actually pretty cool.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:41.320]   Yeah.
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.800]   Retaining the full functionality but just having a few extra features.
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.720]   You're using the Surface mouse there, I see.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:49.160]   Not the gaming mouse.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:50.160]   No.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:51.160]   I don't.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.160]   It's probably hackable too.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.160]   Yeah, probably.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.160]   They're all, you know.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:55.160]   Why would you hack a mouse though?
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:00.280]   Like, what benefits could it be from getting access to my mouse?
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.520]   You used a SteelSeries Sensei mouse.
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.560]   Good for pranks, especially during esports events.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:05.560]   Oh, no.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:08.320]   If your team is playing and not, yeah, cheap.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.320]   Yeah.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:11.720]   I wanted to prank my co-worker, not cheat at DarkF2.
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:18.920]   With a $20 million prize pool at the International 2016 tournament, you might want to, you know,
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:19.920]   maybe some incentive to.
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.920]   Oh, Dota 2.
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:22.880]   Hack that other guy's mouse.
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.160]   Did you go up to that one?
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:25.000]   No.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000]   We have a friend.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000]   Peter Bright.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000]   Peter Bright.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000]   Our second guy is a big Dota 2 fan.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000]   He's a big Dota 2 fan.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000]   So he gives me a praise of the Sitch.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.160]   I'm now too old and boring to play games, sadly.
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.160]   Listen, Destiny.
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:40.160]   What did you say, Destiny?
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:41.160]   Destiny.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:42.160]   You play Destiny?
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.960]   Yeah, Ryan Lawler got me on it.
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:44.960]   That's a game.
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.720]   Yeah, but I don't play like, I don't like watch esports.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:49.120]   You go down to the Batega.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.680]   I go down to the Batega and play exactly.
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:52.440]   By the paper towels for Steve.
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:53.960]   Okay, Destiny and paper towels.
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:54.960]   You heard a broadphone.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:57.440]   We've talked about this, I think, on security now.
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:59.560]   This is a flaw in Broadcom.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.560]   There's a fun one.
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:02.800]   There's a fun bug.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:08.040]   This also is part of a talk at Defcon.
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.960]   You could take the Broadcom firmware and hack it in such a way that it then connects
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:18.120]   with all the other phones it can see and infects their firmware.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:27.400]   So it's a replicating worm and one billion devices, both Android and iOS, were vulnerable
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:33.360]   to it until early July and last week when Google and Apple issued patches.
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.360]   Last week, Apple fixed this.
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.280]   When are we going to get some good news on the security front?
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:40.320]   I feel like whenever I come on Twitter, it's like, here's the good news.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:42.280]   This was patched before it was revealed at Black Hat.
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:43.280]   Oh, okay.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.280]   That is good.
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:50.360]   But, I mean, that is, imagine a replicating code that I put on your phone and then everybody
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:55.560]   you come with in contact with gets the bug and everyone they, it would spread to those
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:58.800]   billion phones in no time.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.480]   It's like that shampoo ad.
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.920]   I expected two friends and they infected two friends.
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:05.320]   I have not seen the shampoo ad.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:06.320]   That's an old ad.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.320]   I don't know.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:08.320]   I'm bringing up old stuff.
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.320]   I'm so old.
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:10.320]   You are not that old.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:13.320]   I don't know if it's before the show.
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:15.520]   I think we could stop.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:17.520]   This flash is dead.
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:18.520]   Finally.
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:21.720]   Well, not dead yet.
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:22.720]   2020.
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:24.720]   Oh, are you serious?
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:25.720]   It's funny.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.720]   20.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.200]   Well, you know, you got to degrade some systems and stuff.
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.480]   I checked my speed because I'm using ethernet for the first time in this apartment.
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:34.800]   I want to see what it was.
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:35.800]   Yeah.
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:36.800]   The little speed test on that.
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:38.720]   That was the flash box for some reason.
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:40.280]   I don't know why that needed me.
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:44.160]   I mean, in fact, there's tools now that will convert anything and almost anything in Flash
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.160]   to HTML5.
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:49.360]   So I think it's appropriate that Adobe said, well, we're going to kill it in three years.
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:53.120]   You might want to start porting your stuffed HTML5.
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.480]   We did a great roundup of like all of the old Flash games and like, you know, original
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:00.720]   like viral videos that were on Flash from back in the day.
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:01.720]   Was it Pogo?
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.720]   Remember Pogo.com?
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:03.720]   No.
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:04.720]   It's still around.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.720]   I bet it is.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:06.720]   I bet it's still using Flash.
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:07.720]   Yep.
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:08.720]   Oh, wow.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:10.480]   This is like the old bonus.com site.
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:12.760]   You want to play a mahjong escape?
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:14.440]   Sure you do.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:15.840]   Let's just play a little.
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:18.840]   It requires Flash player and able to run Pogo games.
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:21.960]   We recommend using the latest version of Internet Explorer 11.
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.960]   What?
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:23.960]   Oh my God.
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.080]   Not even Edge.
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:30.880]   So I can't actually play the game because I don't have Flash on this Windows machine.
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:33.440]   Pogo.com, it's still here.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:34.440]   And guess what?
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:36.280]   Your grandma's still using it.
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:39.280]   They're going to take away my mahjong.
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.720]   Is Pogo just like web based Zynga before Zynga?
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:42.720]   Yeah.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:43.720]   Pogo.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:44.720]   Yeah.
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:45.720]   Pogo's been around for a year.
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:46.720]   Yeah.
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:47.720]   What do you Pogo?
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:48.720]   A bunch of those.
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.720]   Oh, wow.
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:50.720]   15 years ago.
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:51.720]   15 years ago.
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:52.720]   Yeah.
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:53.720]   All right.
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:54.720]   Well, no, it's got to be older than that.
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:55.720]   All right.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:56.720]   This is like the Internet like archive episode.
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:57.720]   I like this.
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:58.720]   I got to look.
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:18:59.720]   Addictivegames.com.
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:00.720]   I think it was another good one.
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:01.720]   Oh, that one?
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:02.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:03.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:05.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:09.920]   Oh, there's a lot of this ambiguation going on here.
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:15.120]   There's a lot of Pogo's on a website featuring free online games.
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:17.440]   Here we go.
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:23.520]   It was 1999 electronic arts owns it.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:24.720]   It's owned by EA.
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:25.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:26.720]   Are you serious?
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:27.720]   It used to be.
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:31.880]   Well, some of them are Java, I guess, but most of them are Flash.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:33.600]   Is Java still a thing or has that gone to?
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.600]   I've never heard Java still live.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.840]   In fact, more people program in Java than any other language.
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:40.240]   And now I just sound stupid.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:41.240]   To this day.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:42.240]   Oh, well.
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.280]   Well, who's really stupid here?
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:45.280]   They or you?
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:47.080]   I don't know enough to answer that question.
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.160]   No, I used the transitive verb correctly.
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:51.360]   Do you want five points?
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:52.360]   Yeah.
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.360]   You have 10 points.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:54.360]   I could have said them, but no, I said they.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:55.360]   Okay.
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360]   15 points.
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.360]   Okay.
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:03.560]   Are you going to get microchip implants, kids, so you can use vending machines without any
[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:04.560]   effort?
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:06.440]   I like apple pay.
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:07.440]   Yeah.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.040]   This is so dopey.
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:10.040]   But the best.
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.040]   Okay.
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:14.840]   So you all probably saw the TV news article about three square market technology company
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.240]   in Wisconsin.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:17.440]   Is there such a thing?
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:19.240]   No, I'm sorry, Wisconsin.
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:20.240]   That was mean.
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:21.240]   That was rude.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:22.240]   The vice.
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:23.240]   The vice is offended.
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:27.000]   University of Madison just got a half billion dollar payment from Apple for inventing some
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000]   chip technology.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.200]   So of course, anyway, they're getting RFI, do the employees on Tuesday when they come
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:37.760]   in will be offered RFID chips.
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:39.120]   They have a little staple gun.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:50.240]   They go, ah, program is not mandatory, but 50 out of 80 employees have volunteered.
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:57.480]   And they asked the CEO, by the way, the company that's providing this is from Sweden.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:58.480]   Sweden.
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:01.200]   And its name is biohacks international.
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:09.240]   So I think they, yeah, they already know biohacks international.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:13.200]   Now remember, there were Mexican diplomats who were getting these RFID chips, but that
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:16.040]   was because they were getting kidnapped and they just want to be identified after the
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:17.040]   remains were found.
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:18.800]   Okay, that's just sad.
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:23.240]   This is, this is, they say more for like paying for stuff or identifying you for the, you
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.640]   know, the card key when you come into the door.
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:26.640]   No, you know what?
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:27.640]   I have my back pocket.
[02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:28.640]   It's just my badge.
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:29.640]   Yeah.
[02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:32.040]   Like I'm not, what happened to my company?
[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:33.480]   Sorry, my go for it.
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:34.640]   What happens when you leave the company?
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:36.240]   What are you going to get a new chip?
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:37.240]   They have every company.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:39.040]   You know, the staple removers.
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:40.040]   Oh, fuck it.
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:42.040]   You have like track market.
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:44.240]   I don't want to be broken into the first place.
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:45.240]   Yeah.
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:49.880]   If my boss said you can either stay here or you can stay and get a chip or leave, I would
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:51.960]   be like, all right, deuces, I'm out.
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:55.640]   I'm not, no, you can't, you know, get to inject things in my body.
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:58.840]   I'm already selling you my time and Leo told me that's the most important thing.
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.840]   So now you don't get lost.
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:04.320]   There's also the security issue because it's easy to figure out what that ID is encoded
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.320]   in an ID.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:08.560]   And they asked, I think it was the CEO of the company, well, what about, you know,
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:12.600]   couldn't somebody pose, you know, steal the number, you know, get a RFID reader while
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:15.400]   your employees drunk at the bar and steal his number again.
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.240]   He says, no, no, you don't have to worry.
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.240]   They're encrypted.
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:19.240]   So what?
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:21.640]   Well, there you go.
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:22.940]   They're encrypted.
[02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:23.940]   That's going to be soon.
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:24.940]   Watch.
[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:25.940]   Mark my words.
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:27.480]   The new buzz phrase for security.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:28.640]   It's encrypted.
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:31.480]   And you'll see it on potato chip bags and everything.
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:34.160]   And people just go, well, it's got to be lock up your chips, kids.
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.160]   Let me save.
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:36.160]   They're coming for you.
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.480]   You're working with my chips are encrypted.
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:39.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to wrap this up.
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:45.440]   He is a LEX, Alex on Twitter, a handle he got for mere pennies on the dollar.
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:46.440]   Sure, actually.
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:47.640]   And it's probably worth more.
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.640]   It's yeah.
[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:49.640]   People have offered me a lot of money for it.
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:50.640]   Yeah.
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:51.640]   AEX.
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:53.280]   Remember Matt Houghton got hacked because he had MAT.
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:55.080]   You got to be careful with the tractor turned on.
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:56.080]   Oh, good.
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:22:57.080]   Good man.
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:22:59.400]   K-O-V-A-C-H.
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:02.840]   He's @SteveKovak on the Twitter and you find him as a senior correspondent at Business
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:03.840]   Insider.
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:04.840]   Always a pleasure.
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:08.840]   Mike Murphy uses Roman numerals for his Twitter handle for reasons we don't fully
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:10.040]   understand.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:11.040]   My name was a minor.
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:12.040]   Oh, OK.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.040]   MCWM.
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.640]   I thought I thought it meant you were born in 19.
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:16.640]   Well, W doesn't mean anything.
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:21.080]   I was going to say it's down quickly.
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:26.920]   It looks like a Roman numeral, but it's not.
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:28.440]   Hey, thanks for joining us, Mike.
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:30.560]   I hope you enjoyed your visit and come back soon.

[02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:53.280]   They will write the title of the show.
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:54.280]   It's important.
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:56.840]   It's going to have something to do with Alex, I'm sure.
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:59.520]   Also, if you want to visit us in studio, we had a nice studio audience.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.760]   They're only half asleep now.
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:05.760]   They just emailed tickets at Twit.tv and we put a very comfortable action.
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:08.160]   You guys got stuck with a really uncomfortable chairs.
