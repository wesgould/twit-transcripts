[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.960]   And since there's absolutely nothing to talk about this will be a nice 10 minute show today.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.840]   Joining us from Houston in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.160]   We've got the great Dwight Silverman.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160]   Hi Dwight.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   Hey there Leo, how are you?
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160]   Great to have you back.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.240]   Do you have a great Christmas?
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.280]   I had a wonderful Christmas.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.440]   Although it's about, it's got close to 80 degrees here today.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.240]   So, yes, it's been very un-January like.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.040]   You were just saying you had snow a couple of weeks ago.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.640]   You had snow a few weeks ago and then a few days later we were in the low 80s.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.080]   It's crazy.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.480]   Do we now believe in global warming?
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.360]   We believe in global something, that's what that is.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.840]   Also here Mr. Robert Scoble, the Scobleizer.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.080]   We don't usually get Robert in here.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   It's nice to have you.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080]   It's great to be here.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   Thanks for coming in here.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   I'm going to move the mic.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080]   Right in front of your mouse.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.760]   My first time in the studio here.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   I usually on Skype.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.280]   John, tell him what he'll win when he comes in the studio.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.920]   You'll win a trip to Las Vegas.

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.560]   It's been a weird winter.

[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.720]   Oh wait a minute, he can't hear you now talk.

[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   Yep.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.080]   And when did you make the bet?
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   I don't know.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   It was about eight months ago, wasn't it?
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah, it was about a year ago.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.440]   I give Devorak a lot of credit for picking McCain to get as far and McCain got as far
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   as he did.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   That's pretty good.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.640]   I picked Obama and this was before he beat...
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.880]   No, you picked Hillary didn't you?
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   You picked Hillary.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   No, I picked Obama.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.360]   And I bet a hundred bucks on him.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.360]   You bet.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   Let's go to the tape.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.160]   I'm sure we can find a tape of that somewhere.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800]   So we are sitting here.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   The reason I'm kind of making a joke about the lack of news is that this is the big week
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.480]   before all the news emerges.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.160]   This is the week before Mac world Expo and CES.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.960]   And presumably there will be some announcements at both.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.520]   What do you think, John?
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:28.280]   Do you think the Apple announced very close to Showtime just a few weeks ago that Steve
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.320]   Jobs would not in fact be giving the keynote that Phil Schiller would be?
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.960]   Does that mean Apple won't have anything to announce?
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.960]   You know what?
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.280]   I think that the year 2009 is going to be a year with very little except tweaks.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   Because of the economy.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   From Apple?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   No, no, just because I think they've run out of gas.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   Oh.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   Interesting.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280]   They got some products.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.360]   They want to maximize sales.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   You know, they didn't work on maybe some new ideas.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.720]   I don't think I, you know, I don't know what do they have up their sleeve.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.600]   You know, the Apple TV thing, that kind of direction maybe.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.320]   And some of these other little minor products that haven't really done very well.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.360]   The little Macintosh didn't do anything.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.960]   The Apple TV didn't do anything.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.000]   There's two or three other little, you know, the thing that took off is the phone.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   So let's like work on that a little bit more.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.400]   I think I, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   I could be wrong.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.320]   Any, any disagreement Dwight?
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.000]   Do you think Apple's going to have anything big to say?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.600]   I don't think there'll be any like major new products.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.200]   Although I've seen one rumor about combining Apple TV and the time capsule to create.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   Frankenstein, right?
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.000]   But the idea, you know, that you'll be able to really do some serious storage and stream,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.220]   you know, some of that content back out to say your iPhone or your, your Mac located
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   elsewhere.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.480]   I think that has the potential.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.000]   But that's not like a major new product.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.520]   And I'm, a lot of people don't think this may happen, but I'm kind of thinking you might
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.560]   actually see an iPhone Nano this time.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.080]   No, come on.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.880]   That was just a joke, wasn't it?
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.160]   What is an iPhone Nano even mean?
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.520]   I actually, I, I kind of agree with him.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   What?
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.520]   What?
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   We agree?
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   What?
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   Oh my God.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   What do you mean?
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   Okay.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   Well, what is an iPhone Nano?
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   It's a little teeny, weaning iPhone with no screen.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.040]   It's a smaller iPhone, a kind of more stylish, probably less expensive.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.480]   It looks like a razor.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.120]   Not necessarily a razor, but maybe more like two thirds the size of the iPhone.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.400]   You know, they started showing up on some of the case manufacturers references to iPhone
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   Nano.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   Right.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.240]   And whether those, that's real or not, you know, that could be red herrings.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240]   I don't know.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.120]   But to a certain extent, the fact that they're starting to sell them at Walmart, they're obviously
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.640]   trying to drive things down to the lower end of the market.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.040]   I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see a four gigabyte iPhone Nano, as well as on the
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.680]   other end, a 32 gigabyte iPhone on the full size.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.800]   Wouldn't that have leaked by the FCC though, or somebody would have leaked a new iPhone?
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.160]   I mean, Apple can't keep secrets anymore.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.240]   You could do the same thing that you did with the original iPhone, which is announce it and
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   say now we're going to send it to the FCC.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.040]   You're right though, Apple's been a terrible, doing a terrible job of keeping sense of it.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.600]   At the top of tech meme right now, they said there's a new 17 inch MacBook Pro coming out.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.760]   I saw that that's basically the same as the Unibody.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.200]   No removable battery though.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   What does that mean?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   It's not crazy.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.680]   No, see that's why it's a bogus rumor.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   Why would you even think of that?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   Because it's not-
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   No, they're pretty much into no removable batteries.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.080]   No, they got removable batteries in all the other laptops.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.120]   Yeah, and they didn't do that with the new 15 inches.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.440]   Yeah, it makes sense with the mini, but why would you do it with a 17?
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.280]   With this specific, with a 17 inch, the rumor is that they're doing a really super thin
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.600]   battery that has a lot longer battery, longer life in general, so that you don't have to
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.040]   make it out as much.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.000]   And some speculations would be about as hard to remove as a hard drive, so those who are
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.040]   more technically inclined could remove it, but you just couldn't replace it.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.080]   The interesting thing is a lot of the journalists I follow are going to see yes only and not
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   to Macworld.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.680]   Is that something that you guys are noticing?
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.160]   I'm not going to Macworld.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.880]   That's interesting.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   Here's my question.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.600]   How long before Macworld's history?
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   I mean, look, Apple said-
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   That's it.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   This is it.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   This is the last year.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   That's why I'm going to Macworld.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.280]   There's one more for sure because Paul Kenn has already said we booked the hall.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.000]   It might be kind of quiet.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   There's no Apple, no Adobe, no Belkin.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.680]   You can cancel the deal.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   I think you can.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.880]   This is what happened in Boston, right?
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.760]   They went one more after Apple left Boston.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.400]   Certainly I'm seeing some interesting stuff come.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.360]   I've been briefed on some stuff coming out at CES at the showstopper show.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   Let's talk about CES.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.520]   Is there anything, what's going on?
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.680]   What's going to be cool there?
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.720]   There's home networking is going to be interesting and home networking for normal people.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.320]   Well, the HP Media Smart, they kind of jumped the gun on that.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.760]   Even that's a little geeky, right?
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.000]   I'm talking about something you plug into your ethernet and plug into the wall and it
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   does stuff for you.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.160]   How hard is home networking anyway?
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's hard for real people.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   For real people.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Well, it's bogus.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.040]   I mean, you can plug, I mean, you buy the little router, you get the little life ideal,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.240]   you plug a few wires and it just works.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   I don't have a problem with it.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.080]   Yeah, except that when people do that, they have a completely insecure network.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   Well, the new setups for the new routers and the new adapters all walking through a security
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   setup.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   Exactly.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.680]   In fact, I'll argue with you on that one, Leo, because I'm on the side of this hill and
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.840]   I have access to about 25 little networks around here.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.440]   I would say two years ago, at least half of them were wide open.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.920]   As of today, all of them are locked down.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   That surprises me.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.440]   I still go around and ward drive and see lots of links and default and notes.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.840]   Those are all because I'm telling you, anything you buy nowadays is locked down.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.600]   I mean, it's actually horrible.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.760]   You can't borrow a Wi-Fi anymore.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.560]   Well, once in a while, something happens to your connection.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.720]   You might just get your email.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.440]   I don't think it's a big deal, so you lock on to somebody.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   There's nothing.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.800]   I got nothing here.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.160]   How do you like your new setup?
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.800]   Did we talk about that on the air or off the air?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.320]   I can't remember.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.000]   You've got a new kind of interesting internet access situation up there.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.960]   That's up north.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   Yeah, up north, we've got a...
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:18.720]   Eric had discovered that there was a piece of fiber on this block below where we live,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.800]   which is where his house is, running down the street, which is wide open and owned by
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.160]   the Public Utilities Commission.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160]   He tracked down somebody who could lease a chunk of it from.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.440]   Actually, the funny thing was it's actually not underground.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.680]   It's over the... it's on the poles, which makes it a lot cheaper to get it.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   How did he find it?
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.680]   How did he know?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.440]   Well, you can look up and see it, I guess.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.040]   But he's always been interested in getting some fiber.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.400]   So anyway, so we got this fiber thing.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.840]   Patrick, would you go look and see if there's any fiber out there before?
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   So we bought...
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   You need a kid.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   It's like a truffle dog.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.480]   It's a fiber finder.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   We bought a link to it.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   I bought a thing.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.760]   Now I'm five up and five down for $150 a month.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.480]   We're putting in something called Ethernet in the last mile here.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.000]   Think we're the first people in Petalimida to get it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   That's 10 megabits up and down, but it's 700 bucks a month.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   Well, yeah, 10 up.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   10 up, symmetric.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   That's nice.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.120]   I mean, that's actually the thing that's cool about this five up and five down for $150.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.480]   It's a real five up and five.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.880]   It's not like there's caps or we can't put a server on.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   We can put a server up.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   It doesn't make any difference.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.640]   We can put a bunch of phones on it.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   That's ultimately, I think, where the internet needs to go.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   It's a utility.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.880]   It's not a surface.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   It's not capped.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   It's just bandwidth.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.360]   Do you think we'll ever see that day?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.120]   That's what I would should be, right?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.960]   It's like you buy water.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.560]   What's kind of the way it has been up until now?
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560]   Well, no.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.280]   Because these guys are intruding.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   I guess you're right.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   It's getting worse, isn't it?
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   Right.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   It's going on.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.680]   I mean, you know, two years ago, nobody was talking about bandwidth caps on cable or DSL.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   Right.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.160]   Yeah, but there was always that hidden.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   I think they always had them.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.760]   I think they just never told you.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   Well, that's true.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.120]   Comcast used to come down on you if you got a winner.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.200]   They didn't tell you what you had done.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.760]   You know, having a Dave Weiner, he all of a sudden, you know, they said they said, "It's
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.560]   sentiment note saying, 'You're a hog.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.720]   We're turning you off.'"
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   Like what?
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   Right.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   Of course, what was Weiner?
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   Did that have anything to do with this bandwidth?
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   We don't talk about what Weiner's up to.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.520]   Have you two had a falling out?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520]   What's going on?
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.320]   You guys were buddies for ages.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320]   I talked to Calcana.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   That's why.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   No.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   There's this.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.440]   Now, see, this is an interesting thing.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.640]   This has gotten two incestures.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.280]   We all have these cross relationships now and somebody hates somebody else.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   And I think that's because of Twitter.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   I think it's because of Friend Feed.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.840]   I think it's all this interaction.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.360]   We were better off what we were all in our little closets all by ourselves and we'd emerge
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.000]   once a year at CES or Comdex and that would be it.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.920]   Yeah, there's more than a few of these guys that like to see stay in the closet.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.880]   I just want you to know that that entire speech I just gave was a straight line for
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.680]   John C. DeVoir actually.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.680]   Absolutely.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.680]   That's how long I've worked with.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.360]   It was a complete setup.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.560]   I knew it from the first moment.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.600]   So one of the reasons we went.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   Go ahead.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.840]   Go back to home networking.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.920]   The idea of making it easy.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.120]   I've been playing with Windows 7 and Windows 7 has this interesting feature called Home
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:14.280]   Groups that tries to make it simpler to set up specific folders and things that you share
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.480]   among computers at home.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.080]   So I think you were talking about the idea of networking being difficult.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.120]   I think it's difficult on the computer itself.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.920]   Not necessarily once you get it set up.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.800]   It's figuring out how to make your printer work, how to share files.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.120]   That can kind of be difficult.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.360]   At least if you're on a PC network and certainly on a PC, it makes PC Mac networks.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.760]   It's a little easier with Macs.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.920]   It's getting worse because normal people are getting digital cameras all over the place.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   Oh, it's crazy.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   How do you move your digital photos from computer to computer?
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.440]   How do I get them from my house to my relatives' house so they can watch them?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440]   It's really a pain.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.280]   I know it's a problem because I get the calls on the radio show.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.040]   I know that people are in pain.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.440]   Although I also know there's a huge interest all of a sudden in this stuff.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.000]   Everybody wants a NAS.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.040]   They don't know what to ask for a NAS, but everyone wants a NAS.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   That's what I'm going for.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   They're going to get something.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.520]   At CES, you're going to hear about something that you just plug in.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.720]   There's no geeky terms about it.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.880]   You just buy it, plug it in, and it does all sorts of stuff like overtime.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.760]   The other stuff that I'm seeing is stuff to plug onto your HDTV to make it easier for
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.320]   normal people to get show videos and photos on your HDTV.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.120]   Well, we've seen those for ages.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.520]   Yeah, but they've been too hard for normal people.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.000]   Everybody in this room all knows how to get a photo.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Oh, Sandis made a device.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.840]   You plug in, you put it on the top of the TV, and then you put your little...
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.840]   I never...
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.840]   Does anybody do that?
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   Do you do that?
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.480]   You go home with your compact flash, your SD card, plug it in and say, "Hey, everybody,
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.480]   come here.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   Look at all my pictures."
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.920]   We all surround ourselves on the Mac, or on the PC.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   That's so sad.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.400]   Or I put them up on Flickr, and I'd call that down and say, "Hey, my new photos are on Flickr.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.280]   Like I did last night."
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.480]   I think we'll also see this.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.920]   I don't know if there's a market for this.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   3D TVs.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.240]   Then everybody's talking about this.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.080]   Yeah, I saw that at Berlin.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   It's crappy.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.400]   I don't want a 3D TV.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.760]   Even if you did, it's crappy.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.880]   The quality of the experience is crappy.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   Really?
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   And it looks blurry to me.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   I don't think it'll go anywhere.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   They look blurry.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.440]   That is the problem.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   And there's no content.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.760]   Well, and the video networks are still happening.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.720]   There's going to be content.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   All the movie companies are getting behind 3D.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Yeah, that's bullshit.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.920]   You don't think so?
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.320]   No, the TV companies are still struggling to get up to HD.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.000]   And that's a huge improvement.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.720]   A 3D doesn't give you how much information.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.360]   Every game, I was starting to run and try out.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.680]   We do a hardware show.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.360]   Every game, basically because it has Z-Buffer information built in the game, can do very
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.360]   simply do 3D.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.200]   It's not so difficult to flip that switch.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   TVs are blurry.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   I saw them at--
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.760]   Hey, do you put on a glasses?
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   How do you do it?
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.960]   No, no, you just stand in front of the TV.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.120]   Microsoft had a prototype of it when I worked there.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.440]   It looks 3D, but it's blurry.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.160]   It's using little pixel elements on the TV to make it sort of a pseudo 3D.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.360]   It's just not very good quality.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.160]   You look at that next to a DLP monitor or something, or next to a TV, it's Sony or
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.080]   Panasonic or Pioneer.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.800]   It just doesn't look sharp.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   Are you off air?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   No?
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   Okay.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   I went, oh, rats.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.240]   No, I forgot to turn your microphone on again.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   I don't know whether it's--
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.680]   Yeah, people aren't going to buy 3D TV until it looks like real TV and is 3D.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.280]   As long as there's some kind of compromise, they're not going to go for that.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.880]   Or do you have to wear special glasses or--
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.880]   Right.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.520]   And there's always this cycle of particularly in film where, oh, 3D is back and the glasses
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.760]   are lighter or they're less intrusive or something, but it goes for a month or two
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.680]   and then it dies.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680]   It's true.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   If I think back at 3D, you know, you first you had the red and green glasses, House of
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.080]   Wax, right?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   BOMB.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.520]   Then it came back in the '80s at Disneyland with Captain EO and Michael Jackson.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.520]   BOMB.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   Then IMAX.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.440]   Listen, BOMB, they packed a new new series of things.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.720]   If you've seen that 3D movie like--
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.120]   And Honey, I Shrunk'd a Kid, whatever it was, it was quite worth it.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   Yeah, honey, I Shrunk'd a Kid.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   You like that?
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   It was quite a bowl.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   And it was really--
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   But you would want it in your home.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   It was fantastic.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.160]   There was one effect at the end where there's little monsters sitting on the shoulder of
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160]   the person in front of you.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.120]   I mean, it was really fantastic, but it's not the same as-- I mean, 3D TV is like, what
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   are we going to get out of it?
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.400]   The little discreens not big enough, but I think 3D and the movie theaters will be a
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.680]   good gimmick for more than-- I think it's going to be more in a few months.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.200]   It's going to be probably two of its theaters.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   Yeah, we went and saw you two 3D, you two-- the rock and roll concert.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   It was awesome.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   I wanted to see that.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   It was awesome.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   Was it?
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.960]   It was a studio in 3D with really good glasses on, not the cheap, red and blue ones, but the
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   whole--
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.640]   I just remember seeing Superman returns in 3D on IMAX, and it was really annoying because
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.000]   the whole movie wasn't in 3D, just portions.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.440]   So they put a little icon on the bottom of the screen you're supposed to put on your
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.800]   glasses, watch the Superman fly at you, then put the icon pops up and you take it off again.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.120]   And I couldn't even follow the story because I was so busy putting glasses on and off.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   That seemed like a bad idea.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.840]   But I guess for you two, I guess that would be fun.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   So back to--
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.400]   Was it Bono come flying at you?
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   Oh, it was awesome, man.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   Really?
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.440]   He would ride over the drummer when he raised his sticks up.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   We were all like, whoa.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.920]   I'll tell you, that's the problem with 3D is that the content companies feel compelled
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.320]   to do stupid 3D tricks.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.160]   So the whole thing ends up being just a stupid--
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:29.600]   Well, do you remember Leo the early days when they went from mono phone LPs to stereo--
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   Oh, yeah, they got--
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.760]   Well, even early Beatles that have extreme stereo.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.240]   They have extreme stereo.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.840]   I remember some of these albums that came out that they would have the music going back
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   and forth.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840]   And forth.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   Quadraphonic.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   Imagine this in 3D.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.640]   Do you have a quadraphonic stereo, John?
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.120]   You must have.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.320]   You know, the quad thing came and went and I kind of saw it as a gimmick because it wasn't
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   really-- because you can recreate quad sound with two speakers.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.080]   So I never thought much of the idea.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   I thought you might be the kind of hipster that would have-- because then it would come
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.880]   with a joystick so you could rotate the music around the room.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   So stupid.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.200]   No, pretty much if I don't get it for free, I don't get it.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   What about Palm?
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.000]   The Palm is going to-- by the way, there's a classic to Voreac line.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.440]   Let me make a mark on that.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.880]   Palm is going to try to save itself at CES with the Nova operating system.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.280]   They've kind of longed in the tooth and Nova is going to be a Linux-faced.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.600]   And they just got $100 million thrown at them by--
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.040]   Well, Mac, the Mi's crazy.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   And they're all just like the kind of stuff that they're going to be.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   And they're going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be the guy."
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   I'm going to be the guy.

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   I'm going to be the guy.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   I'm going to be the guy.

[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   That's pretty good for 99 cents.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.040]   What were we saying?
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   I distracted myself.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   We're talking about Android and Android.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   Serious tech talk.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   I agree with you.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   I think it's I think you're right.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   I think Android long term is going to probably be the winner.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   Really?
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   The winner?
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   No, not the winner.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   The winner.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   I think so.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   No, I think it's going to do just what you said.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.

[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   I think it's going to go right past the way.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   It's what VISTA should have been.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   It's visually tweaked.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   It's a lot nicer to use.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   It bugs you a lot less.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   You can make it bug you less and still be secure.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   It runs pretty well on older hardware.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.040]   I've got it running on a Pentium 4 with 2Gigoram
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   and it runs like butter.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   That was the most interesting decision that Microsoft made.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   They componentized everything.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   I think perhaps motivated by the netbook revolution.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   They wanted to make sure it would run on low and slow hardware.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   Remer I worked at Microsoft during when VISTA was being built.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   I take you back to where?
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   Why does your insight into what happened here?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   What they were trying to do was build 100 stories,
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   a high skyscraper.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.040]   They got to about level 50 and the building started leaning.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   They literally had to take the whole thing down.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   They were building everything on VISTA or in Longhorn on top of .net.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   All the cool features were built on top of .net.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   There was their mistake.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.040]   That was Gates's big effort.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   He wanted to put a lot of cool features and make it possible for developers to build apps
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.040]   and things on top of windows in an easy format.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.040]   That seems sensible.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.040]   With .net wasn't up to the job.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   It was not up to the job.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   The building started leaning and they realized .net is not up to the job.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   We're not going to get to 100 stories.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   They tore the whole thing down.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   VISTA has no .net code in it.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   In fact, there was a rule inside Microsoft that you're not allowed to write anything on .net.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   You had to go back to C++.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   It's a sterling recommendation for their platform.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.040]   You better not write it.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   Keep in mind internally inside it.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   You're doing stuff on an operating system that's different than doing a little app for your work group.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   You wouldn't write Windows and Visual Basic .net.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   The problem is they rebuilt VISTA in what a year and so many months.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   They didn't have a lengthy beta process like they are with Windows 7.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   They just didn't get the polish.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   It didn't get the finish.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   Also, they changed a lot with VISTA.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   They changed the driver model.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   That's why a lot of drivers weren't available when it started.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   There was all the compatibility issues.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   They changed the networking stack.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   The networking sometimes didn't always work, but when it did work, it was really cool.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   They changed the audio stack.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   That's another reason why some of the sound cards didn't work.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   Now they've had another two years to polish it.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   Now we're seeing the results of that effort to polish it and make it really sweet and spend some time on the UI.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   In other places that were planned for VISTA back in the...
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   I saw...
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   Have you played with 7?
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   Yeah, it's pretty nice.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   And you love it Dwight, huh?
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.040]   Yeah, Robert was talking about the drivers.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   They've made sure that the drivers are not incompatible.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   The drivers from VISTA aren't incompatible with Windows 7.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   And this is how well they've done it.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   I installed it in VMware Fusion 2 on the Mac.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   And usually when you install the new operating system,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   you have to install these VMware tools, which are specialized drivers to make it run with the virtual hardware.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   The VMware tools for VISTA run perfectly in Windows 7.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   There's no burps.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   I've got all the hardware, the virtual hardware working.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   So they have maintained that and I think there will be a lot more hardware that's compatible with it than it was when VISTA was released.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   Yeah, Steven Sonofsky is running the Windows 7 team now.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   And he's always been known inside Microsoft for shipping and shipping stuff that works.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   And not taking on any really radical revisions or revolutionary things, but making sure that what ships works and that it ships in a good quality state.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   So I'm pretty happy with that.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   I'm really looking forward.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   I still haven't heard Ray Oz.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   He really articulate what he's doing.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   He got close with what's it called?
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   Trebuchet Azure.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   Well, the Azure is part of it.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   And then the mesh is another part of it.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:34.040]   And I have a feeling that that's all going to come together later in the year when the consumer features of Windows 7 get turned on.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.040]   Because you know Microsoft's holding something back.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.040]   And that's the Ray Oz stuff.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   There's some interesting pieces in here that I haven't seen talked about in Windows 7.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   For example, there's a control panel for location services.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   So if your computer has GPS in it, and I don't know a lot of notebooks that have GPS, but if your computer has GPS built into it, it'll use it.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   And I suspect if you're working with some cloud services, just as with the iPhone, that could be really handy.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   And there will be more GPS.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   I interviewed the guys at Broadcom who make the GPS chip for your cell phone.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   By the way, Leo, you should have those guys on your show that and see what they're doing in terms of chip.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   They started in 2000.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   I saw your stuff.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   It looked really cool.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   It was as big as a PC.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   Now it's an eighth of an inch of your thumbnail, and it has GPS on it.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   It has an accelerometer for the iPhone.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   And it has...
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   And it's not for phones.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   It's for...
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   Well, they're making the chip for the phones.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   But the channel laptop could go into a laptop, could go into anything.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   That book.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   Because it's cheap to make that stuff now.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   Because they've made it for...
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   They're making like 200 million of them for cell phones a year.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   Right.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   I have a question.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   Dwight, you said that it would be handy to have GPS interface with the Windows.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   With the Windows 7, if you had GPS in your computer, handy in what way?
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   Well, do you have an iPhone, John?
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   No, I'm not talking about that.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   You said with a computer, with an iPhone, I can see it would be handy.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   You could be roaming around, taking a photo, and it gives you some...
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   But I'm not moving around with my computer.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   I mean, it's like...
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   You are with an notebook?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   Okay, so even if I am...
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   I'm not taking pictures with it.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   I mean, what do I need to do?
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   It's too big to have kind of walking around town.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.040]   No, but it would help you look up Google Maps.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.040]   So you know...
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   Because if the computer knows exactly...
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.040]   Exactly.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.040]   I have the GPS in my notebook, and I have various mapping programs.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   I just boot them up, and I'm roaming around.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   I don't see that as going to make it...
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   I think it's a killer app in a phone.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   I'm not sure in a notebook.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   Yeah, but see, you're going to get it so cheap because it's a piece of silk in the third of a size.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   Why not put it?
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   They'll put it in there, and you're going to get all the same features your iPhone has on your netbook.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   I don't know, though, as phones get more...
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   I'm just not seeing what you just said was going to be...
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   When you say it's going to be handy with such enthusiasm, I'm wondering,
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   "How is it going to be any more handy than what I have already?"
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Well, certainly any time I blog, I'd love to have that metadata
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   added automatically to my blog that I'm blogging from Petalume.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   Do you use Bright-Cite or Looped or any of those?
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   I don't.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.040]   I already tell everybody where I am anyway.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   I use Looped.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   Bright-Cite, actually, is pretty cool.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.040]   I use Bright-Cite.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   But I'm already telling people...
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   Looped ties to Facebook, so I use Looped.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   People can already stalk me.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   They know where I am.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   I don't need to get so good example for these kinds of things,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   because we're semi-public figures.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   But if you're an individual with a group of friends,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   I think of Patrick, and he wants to know where his friends are,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   and they're all hanging out at one place,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   and he can see where they are and go there.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   I think a college kid said that they would love this kind of thing.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   There's an app in the iPhone that I love called Around Me.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   And it has a list of categories of things that you can...
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   It looks at your GPS and says, "Okay, where are all the grocery stores around you?"
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   Near Me.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   Near Me.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   The app is called Around Me.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   Okay.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   Because there's also a near Me.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   And they're similar.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   I mean, there are several of these.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   But on a notebook computer, let's say you're in your hotel at CES,
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   where a Chinese restaurant's around me.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   And you would see this on the notebook, and off you go,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   if you didn't have it in your iPhone.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   So I think there's a lot of application for location.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   I've been really turned on by the idea of location services on the iPhone.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   I think though you said a critical thing.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   If you don't have your iPhone.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   I think though there's less market for this because most people will have this capability
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.040]   built in their phone.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   They're much less likely to go there laptop to do this.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   I mean, I'm playing with Around Me right now.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   It's pretty cool.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   It's pretty cool.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   It's just going to...
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   To me, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   It's so cheap.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   I love location.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   You know, because the cost of these chips now is so cheap that might as well put it into a
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   network, you know, and use it and build a consistent UI,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   consistent experience across all your devices.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   We're going to take a break when we come back the day the Zoom stood still.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   Perhaps the weirdest bug in history.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   At first I want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.040]   They're the folks who make this show possible.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   Hey Dane!
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   Are we doing Twit 2 or Twit 749 today?
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   Hey Dane goes, huh?
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   What?
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   Hey, is it Twit 2 or 749?
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.040]   What are we doing?
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   We're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   Audible has this thing called your daily list.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   I love this.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   This is your daily list and feature for today.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   The art of happiness by his holiness.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   The Dylai Llama.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   Don't you think in your hectic fast paced day Robert's going?
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040]   Dylai.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   How do you say it?
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   Dali?
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   Dali.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   Dali.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   Dali.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   Hello Dali.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   The Dali Llama.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   Probably none of that is correct.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   Probably it's some weird Tibetan word that sounds like
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   "Poy d'Arne joie en d'Arne."
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   Llama.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   Anyway, that guy.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   The guy in the red with the glasses, the giggler.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   He has a book called the Art of Happiness.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   Actually, I have this on my own.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.040]   Whenever I'm a little, you know, whenever I'm down, I'm weary.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.040]   I listen to the Art of Happiness by the Dylai Llama.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   Dali Llama.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   And it makes me happy.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   How did I get that wrong?
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   The Dali.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   It was 1993.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   I had first met the Dali Llama over a decade ago.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Llama over a decade earlier while I was visiting Darn Cell in India on a small research grant
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   to study traditional Tibetan medicine.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   That's somebody else.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   This beautiful and tranquil village perched on a hillside in the foothills of the Himalayas.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   They don't have him reading it.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.040]   But it's still, it's all the words are there.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040]   It's really great.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   Just one of many 51,000 books you can read.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.640]   Or I guess listen to.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.440]   John's always a stickler for getting that right.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.040]   Listen to some wonderful stuff.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   This is actually narrated by Howard C. Cutler MD.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.040]   He's a doctor.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.040]   So, you know, he's narrating it properly.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.840]   All he even says is his name right.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.040]   He was the co-author of the, what are you laughing at?
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   What are you laughing at?
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.040]   Go there right now.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   You get a credit tour to free book.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   You're like, wait, what are you like?
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   Okay.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.040]   Let me ask you, Robert.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   Give me a category.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   I'm reading Guy Kawasaki's.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   Guy Kawasaki's on there?
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   Reality check.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   You like to read business books, that kind of thing?
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   Don Tapskots on there.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.040]   They got business, classics, education, erotica and sexuality.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   That's no funny naughty.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   Don't listen to that when you drive.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   Patrick seemed interested.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   Fiction, history, kids and young adults, mysteries and thrillers, romance, sci-fi.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   I read a lot of sci-fi and Audible.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech and we encourage you to give
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   it a try.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.040]   If you've never tried Audible, get your book free, listen to it.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.040]   You're going to like it too, Patrick.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   Say away from the adult stuff.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.040]   He was arguing about porn with the FCC commissioner.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.040]   Oh, I think he knows a little bit about that.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.040]   Did the FCC commissioner ask him for advice?
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   Is Kevin Martin or the new guy?
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   No, Jonathan Adelstein.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   Oh, really?
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.040]   Oh, wow.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   I'm impressed.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040]   Mr. Kumish.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.040]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   Strangest Bug.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:12.800]   I think Strangest Bug in the history of consumer electronics, the day the Zoom stood still,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.600]   the Zoom decided that 2008 was not a leap year.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.160]   365 days was more than enough.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.640]   So on December 30th, it just stopped working for a day.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   That is so weird.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.240]   Because for only the Zoom 30 gigabyte, however, and that means that only about 10 people were.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.240]   Five people?
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   No, it wasn't.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   It wasn't a huge problem.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.000]   I thought I bought that, or at least maybe there's a million sitting in the store somewhere,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.760]   but there were a million shipped.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.040]   So that's potentially quite a few people.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.280]   Is that a weird bug or what?
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.200]   I found that the whole thing was a peculiar story.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Very peculiar.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.520]   Have you ever heard of-- Jon, you've been around for a few years.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.960]   You ever heard of anything like that?
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   No.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   I find the whole thing.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.920]   I still-- it's so screwy that I'm of the opinion that somebody had maybe planted something
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.240]   in the code, a disgruntled employee.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.200]   No, I looked at the code.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   I actually looked at the code.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.280]   I looked at the code.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.080]   See what I was talking about earlier?
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.480]   Leo has his hands in code.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.240]   I looked at the code.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.400]   And it was a kind of bug like a first year programming student might make.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.680]   It wasn't Microsoft's code, it was Freescale code.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.880]   It's the code, the real-time clock code.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.080]   It happened in the gigabit versions that Toshiba sells.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   See?
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   And that was the same hardware.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Yep.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.960]   And it was not an intentional bug.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   I mean, the source code's there.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.000]   And actually, you know, you ever read Hacker News?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   I love Hacker News.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It's great.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.240]   It's why combinators are combinator.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   It's pronounced Dolly.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   OK.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.520]   It's their kind of feed.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520]   It's a really great feed.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.560]   That's where I saw the source code on that.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:58.920]   And you know, it's just silly little bug somebody made.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   But it's weird.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.720]   And Microsoft's response was, "Well, we're checking into it."
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.320]   It was like, I was watching MSNBC.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.640]   It's like a big story, right?
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.680]   And they had file footage that Gorillas, they kept showing the same file footage that
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   came out when the 30 gig zoom first shipped with a Gorillas album art on it.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.480]   And they kept showing it again and again.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.520]   And they were showing footage of squirting because that's all they had.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   Yep.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.240]   And then Microsoft said, "Well, we're working on it."
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.120]   Finally, they said, "You know what?
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.480]   It's going to be better tomorrow.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   Just leave it alone."
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   Very weird.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.720]   And they all came back.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   They all came back.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.960]   They all came back to life.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.840]   I have one that I was not turned on at the time.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.840]   I was out of town.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.080]   As soon as I got back, it was like on the second.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.280]   And I fired it up and it worked fine.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   No issues at all.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.040]   It had just been sitting, as you said, in a drawer.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.760]   And it works fine.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.120]   I didn't see anything in it.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.560]   I have one of the newer zoons and it ran fine on the day that they all were dead.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.000]   But this first one was the one that had the problem.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.840]   As did mine, I have a four gig zoom.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.400]   So it was only the first generation zoons.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.960]   And actually, zoon is, you know, people like make fun of it because it's kind of ugly.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.520]   But the software is really nice.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.480]   Moving through songs and video is nice.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.280]   It plays video better than, I think, better than the iPod.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.840]   And I like the way video looks on it.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.640]   So it's not that, you know, it's not completely crappy, but people sure like to make fun of
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   it.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.920]   Now, I think, we were talking about phones.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.680]   We didn't talk about Microsoft and Windows Mobile.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:45.200]   And I think you may see something as a result of the danger acquisition and the zoon software
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.000]   that Microsoft tries to do to pull itself out of the Windows Mobile hole.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.040]   I'd love to hear what Robert thinks of that.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.680]   I think that's a possibility.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.000]   I think we were talking about Palm and why Palm doesn't have a chance.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.640]   And I think that's a great example of why it doesn't have a chance because Microsoft still
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.040]   has how many how many Windows Mobile phones sell every year, hundreds of million?
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.920]   Yeah, I mean, it's not a small platform.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.000]   It's not a great platform.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.080]   I mean, but they're still selling a lot of phones around the world and they have relationships
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.280]   with lots of companies who build, you know, devices for them.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   So absolutely, they're going to stay involved in the game and not let Palm back into that
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.240]   table.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.120]   But I don't have any insights there.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.680]   I know a new device is coming.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.240]   Windows Mobile team told me some new stuff is coming.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:36.280]   I'm not sure if it'll be this week, but certainly by the middle of the year, we'll see another
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.600]   new platform coming out.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.840]   What's it going to be?
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   I don't know.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.920]   You know, the people at HP say it's not an iPhone killer.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.360]   So that's the real answer is iPhone still is going to win by the end of the year.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.360]   Well, that's what Palm says.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.480]   We're not going after the iPhone or the Black Bear.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.800]   We're going after the fat middle.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.400]   You know, this is ridiculous, which I resent, frankly.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.200]   We want these guys to go to convenience.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.800]   I have a lot of fat middle and believe me, they ain't going to get me.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.720]   Hey, speaking as the fat middle, go ahead, John.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.320]   I'm just saying, why, you know, what did this guy, you got like a cut?
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   This is like a football team.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.080]   You're within football season right now.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.080]   Right.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.480]   So, you know, well, you know, I know that's the championship team, but we're not going
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.520]   to go after them.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.720]   You know, we just want to kind of come in third.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.560]   You know, what kind of attitude is this?
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.480]   Well, it's a big market coming in third is probably pretty good.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.200]   But it's not exactly a winning attitude.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.480]   Well, losing attitude and this about, I mean, you know, I would, it just seems like they're
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   not competitive.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.880]   I mean, to have this kind of a notion within their strategies.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.760]   I mean, Kiney, Nokia over in Europe has a subscription music service on a cheap phone.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.720]   And all the kids are going crazy about it over there.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   How are they?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.280]   You know, how are you going to beat that?
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.840]   You know, how are you going to get back in the market?
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.440]   How are you going to regain anybody's confidence that you have something interesting to even
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.040]   go into the store and check out?
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   You saw the N97.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040]   You seem to really like that.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   I want one.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   I really think that's to me, it looks like a tilt or something.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.520]   It doesn't look like that.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.720]   It's not an iPhone killer, right?
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.120]   So stop, stop there.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.960]   But it has a great camera on it.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   It has keyboard.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   Five megapixels.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   Five megapixel camera.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.800]   It has a widescreen video.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:20.400]   So for all of us freaks who want to build content for Facebook or YouTube or whatever,
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.320]   it's going to be a great device for that.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.560]   It's a niche device though, because it's so expensive.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.240]   It absolutely is niche, at least in the United States, until they can figure out how to get
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   a carrier to carry it.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.520]   How well did the N95 do?
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.520]   I mean, it was a key.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.520]   Well, why?
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.520]   It did pretty well.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.520]   It sold millions of units.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520]   Geeks loved it.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.080]   But not in the United States because they can't figure out how to get a carrier subsidizing.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   Why not?
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   You're Nokia.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   Huge.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.120]   Why won't the carriers carry these really smart Nokia phones?
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.960]   Because there's iPhone here.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.920]   I mean, if you're at AT&T, you're not going to have to switch from the iPhone.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.320]   Yeah, AT&T carries the storm and Verizon's BlackBerry.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.520]   Why does AT&T carry the storm?
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   The phones.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.000]   Verizon's the one that's pushing the storm.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Well, Verizon, that's right.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.920]   Backberry, AT&T's got the ball.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.000]   But there's already great smartphone devices that already have market share.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.560]   Why would anybody say, "Well, let's go take on Nokia now?"
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   That's their problem.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.080]   Yes, see, I think Apple's going out to the fat middle.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.160]   I think that they're starting out with these high end phone.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.400]   They've continually brought the price down.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.880]   They're selling it at Walmart.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.080]   I think you will see an iPhone Nano.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   And I think that--
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.440]   Now what the Nano's for is like a $99 phone like it's put down.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.560]   Would you see it having any of the application functionality or is it a smartphone?
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   Oh, of course.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   It has to, right?
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   It won't have GPS.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   You need to have a GPS.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   I disagree.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   Oh, really?
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   It's cheap to include.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   I disagree.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   What do you take out?
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560]   You have to take out something.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   Less memory.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   Less memory.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.920]   Maybe a little bit lower quality screen.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   Smaller screen.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.160]   Smaller screen, which is lower quality, right?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.160]   Because like my son wants an iPhone, but I'm not going to give it to him because all
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.560]   the big glass screen he'll sit on it within weeks.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.160]   It's kind of Patrick's had one for two years.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.960]   But I've had friends that have their screen shatter.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   I'm careful.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.640]   Patrick's also not a skater and my son's a skater and he keeps it in his back pocket.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.760]   So actually he likes to do thumbboarding with his phone.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.400]   He flips it in the air and stuff.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.480]   So I don't know if the iPhone is the right choice for him to be honest with you.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.000]   But a Nano might be if it's a little more robust, a smaller screen.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.400]   Does it have a keyboard?
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.640]   No, it's the same functionality as the existing iPhone.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.160]   See, that's the whole problem with the iPhone Nano even as a rumor because when you shrink
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.040]   it down, that nasty virtual keyboard gets even smaller.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.480]   Unless it only works in what I would do is I would only make it work in landscape mode.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   Not portrait.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   That's interesting.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.400]   Do a landscape mode phone.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   All right.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   Big surprises.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.920]   Any at Macworld?
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.920]   Anybody?
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   Potentially.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   Steve Jobs will make a surprise appearance.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.320]   I think he's going to show up on stage with Shiller, right?
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   Because he's got it.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.000]   He's like, right now it's Kimmyl Sung.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.520]   It's like, I mean, it's like he's not.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.800]   Apple's done nothing to quash these rumors.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.080]   I think we're all agreed.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.680]   Steve's fine, right?
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   Anybody think he's ill?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   I think he's fine.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.400]   I've talked to plenty of people who've seen him around town.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   The Yogurt Shop.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.280]   Well, even not just the Yogurt Shop other people have seen him around town lately and
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.480]   said he looks fine.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   It's Kimmyl Sung.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   He's got to make an appearance.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   They've got it.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   Kim Sung-yol.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   To tell you the truth.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   Kim Jong-yol.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   Yeah, it's the dye line llama.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.880]   It's a dye line.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.760]   It's none of our business, whether he's good or not.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   It is our business only because Apple's a publicly held company.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.080]   What's your business if you have shares?
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   Right.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.240]   Well, presumably some of our audience might have an investment in Apple.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.680]   So I think you're right.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.440]   I think it would be crazy for them not to just show up and say hello to the, you know,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   to the Keit the keynote.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.640]   Is he going to be the one more thing, you know?
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   That would be funny.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.720]   He's the one more thing.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.720]   Okay.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.720]   Or he's a, you know, how they'll often do like an eye chat demonstration.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.400]   He's who they'll eye chat with.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.600]   He's in the audience dressed as the dolly llama.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.000]   That could be.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.200]   Yeah, they could put a virtual head up there, the giant head of Steve Jobs.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.920]   I am jobs, the rich and powerful.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.560]   Now that, that actually is a pretty interesting guess, you know, if they come out with a really
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.280]   cool new chat system, a new Twitter killer or something.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   And it's Steve.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   And it's Steve.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   And he's in France.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.080]   Or he's in France, you know, or he's home, you know.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   That would be cute.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   Yeah, that would be very cute.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.880]   I think that's a pretty, pretty fair bet.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.160]   C.E.S.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.520]   Big, what is the big surprise at C.E.S.?
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   3D.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   Come on.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   That's sad.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.480]   First of all, that's not a surprise.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   It was at IFA, you know, six months ago.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   I don't know.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.480]   SEDT.V.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.880]   To me, I'm walking around with Best Buy.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.880]   No.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.640]   It's back to reality, back to reality for the consumer electronics.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.880]   I think that's the story is how small is C.E.S. this year?
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.840]   How bad is the consumer electronics industry?
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:09.960]   And how are we going to get motivated to go and buy new gadgets in a time when we're
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.840]   all laid off?
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.760]   Watching the pricing of these gadgets should be interesting too.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:20.200]   I think you're going to see a lot fewer, you know, $2.99 and $3.99 devices and a lot
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.600]   more than $99 devices.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.000]   I think C.E.S. is going to be a dud.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   That's why I'm not going.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Actually, I know that.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.360]   You say that every year, John.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   Every year it's a dud.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   First of all, he's always right.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   He's always right.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.720]   That's the one thing that Devorik actually is right about.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.360]   It's the one thing, but that one's for sure.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.920]   But you know, as far as John always says that, he's always says he's not going and then always
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.200]   at the last minute, not often, but often at the last minute, you say, "Ah, I'm going
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   to go."
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   And you go for an afternoon.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.080]   I'm going to go because I'm going to do this special thing.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.600]   Aren't we going to do something at the Mac world for the Twitch show?
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.200]   Oh, yeah, I don't think so.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.800]   Oh, you bailed out on it?
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   I was going to do it.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:04.080]   I was going to do it in appearance fee and I thought, "Kevin Rose, is that how we're monetizing
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   now?"
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.640]   Are you buying lunch?
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.680]   He should be paying you the appearance fee.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.120]   No, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.000]   Yeah, I was going to...
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.400]   I've been really agonizing over this keynote and I thought, "Well, maybe what I'll do is
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.840]   I'll just bring out you and Kevin and a bunch of other people and do a panel or something.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.440]   But I think I'm just going to talk."
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.440]   But come anyway, you know what?
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.440]   Make a surprise appearance.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.800]   You could be like Steve Jobs.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   It's like a peer.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   It'd be really cool.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.400]   So basically you fired us on, you're just going to do it by yourself.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.440]   Well, I wasn't paying you anyway, but if you want, you can come on stage.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.840]   I'm talking about the end of the world as we know it.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.120]   I'll tell you what, can you do me a favor?
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.640]   And record it and send me the PowerPoint.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:53.800]   So, what would be great would be a cut to the job or not?
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:51:01.000]   Like Phil Schiller's keynote and "Stream It Live" and "Get Leo" and "Dvorak" and "Calcanis"
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.800]   and "Kevin Rose" sitting down in front like Mystery Science Theater 3000.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.440]   That would be funny, wouldn't it?
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.360]   And then in real time, react to what...
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.560]   I've always wanted to do that.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   Apple won't let us do it, but I would love to do that.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.320]   I'm just going to be reading this all on Twitter.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.720]   Is that how you will follow it?
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.720]   Absolutely.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.440]   In fact, that's how I got my news when the iPhone came out.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.280]   People were telling me, "Oh, do you just see what Apple is like?"
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.520]   This Twitter has really replaced live blogging, really, because you get it from a variety
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.520]   of sources.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   Do people use hashtags?
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.680]   Is that how you follow it?
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   Partly.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.280]   So, there will be a Mac world hashtag that I'll follow.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.240]   But also, just people will start talking if something cool comes out.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   You watch the conversation.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   Everybody will be talking about it.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.600]   Apple, look it Apple, look it Steve Jobs, yeah.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.600]   Whatever.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   That's really true.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.480]   I guess if you're going to go up there on stage and do this, that is what's going to
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.800]   happen to everybody in the audience.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.400]   No, no one's going to be looking up.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   I know.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   They're only going to be Twittering.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.040]   You give a speech because you get this audience full of these bloggers because I've seen this.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.640]   I find it very annoying.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.440]   You go up there and nobody's looking at you.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.640]   You can be doing, you know, some of you can be making faces or doing something.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.440]   I was going to bring my blue ball and sit on that.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   It's not going to happen, right?
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   So, nobody's going to see it.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   So, they got all down there.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   They're all blogging away.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:14.160]   It would be cool if you could like transition from acting away, you are recording and you
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.160]   sneak off stage.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   Just be bad.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   Go, go, go.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.840]   It's going quiet.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:26.120]   And just let this recording continue until somebody looks up and says, "Where's Leo?"
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.120]   That would be good.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   I like that.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.960]   Well, if you're really lucky, the Wi-Fi won't work like it did.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.080]   It didn't add LeBlanc or LeWet over in Paris.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.600]   And then you have to pay attention to the content because there's nothing to do.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.680]   That must have been interesting.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.920]   People had to close their laptops and watch you.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.400]   We didn't close our laptops.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   We kept hitting the Wi-Fi button.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   No thing for it.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   Oh, man.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   No wonder it never worked.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   We needed a hit.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.040]   Oh, man.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.440]   There are people shaking in the aisle.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   Oh, man.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   It was awful.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.440]   While they were shaking for two reasons.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.880]   One, it was really cold there.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.720]   And two, you had no Wi-Fi.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.880]   Geez, they were.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.440]   The last year at Mackerel, they turned off the...
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   Oh, so I...
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   So, Daniel was...
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   Daniel was...
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.360]   Sorry, Daniel was just at Mackerel over at the hauling.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.080]   He says the Wi-Fi there sucks.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.080]   It always sucks.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.080]   It always sucks.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.920]   Yeah, nobody's there yet and it sucks.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.080]   I'm on there and I can't even get on there.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.080]   No, but go ahead.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.080]   What were you saying?
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.080]   Yes.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.520]   Well, last year during the keynote, they disabled it.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.560]   You could see it, but it wouldn't go anywhere.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   Right, that's interesting.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.840]   And so, a lot of people were switching to air cards and, you know, doing it that way.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   I spent...
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.640]   I mentioned this year, it'll be a lot of iPhones and a lot of Twittering out of there.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.560]   I don't know why we even bother going because as long as, you know, somebody from Engadget's
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.880]   gone and Mac rumors, well, that's my feeling about trade shows in general now.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.880]   I agree.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.480]   I liken it to a football game.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.080]   It's fun to go for the atmosphere, but you don't see the game.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.400]   The best way to watch a football game is at home on TV.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:50.280]   In fact, it was interesting two years ago, we were at the blog house and we got to play
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.000]   with the HP computer as soon as Bill Gates talked about it.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.280]   All the press people who were stuck in the hall listening to Bill couldn't write about
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.320]   it because they didn't have personal experience with it.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:04.000]   And so, everybody who was outside the hallway got a better scoop than the journalists who
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.560]   went to the actual keynote.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.480]   Is it over for trade shows?
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:14.280]   Well, actually, to stay on that point for one more beat, I like to use the example of
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   a C-bit, which is a big trade show that still, you know, apparently stays in business.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.600]   And C-bit has 2,500 booths and there are 10,000 reporters that cover it.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:30.520]   And so you have four reporters per booth assuming they only cover one thing, which they don't.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:35.800]   I mean, it's so over covered and C-E-S is the same way.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   It's over covered.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.840]   There's so many people like Robert said, you know, just that these gizmodo, the other
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.040]   guys, you know, go off and cover it.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.040]   Right?
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   And then there's actually a couple of other bloggers that really hit it really hard, harder
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   than I would.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.840]   And why would you, what's the point of going?
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.560]   Just cover the coverage and you get more out of it.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.120]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.400]   That's what I've done for the last three or four years.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.280]   Sorry, I'm getting around to that by following around Best Buy and seeing what they're saying.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.520]   I think that's an interesting, so you're going to, around with a buyer because that's
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.520]   really what C-E-S is all about.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.400]   A vice president and we're going to talk about the future.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   Same idea though.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.160]   This is, this is, this she's looking at, you know, what are we going to stock on our stores
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.000]   this fall?
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.760]   So how are we going to change the store and what are the trends?
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   And how are they going to survive?
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   I don't think they'll be on fescopany.tee.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   Well, it'll be a summer because I'm going to be doing live video with a little bit of
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   a flip cam, you know.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   Oh, you're going to do it with quick.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.240]   Yeah, Rocky's not even going.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Rocky's like happy.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.080]   I wouldn't want to make Rocky unhappy.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.040]   But Rocky doesn't have to stand in the two hour taxi lines either.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.040]   That's a good point.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   Rent a car.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   Rent a car.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.600]   Actually, this year, by the way, you can get hotel rooms for like 200 bucks.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   That's a telling.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   That's a telling style.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   That's like half what it normally is, right?
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.040]   And you can still get, we're taking a bus down on Tuesday with a bunch of bloggers, but,
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.200]   you know, you can still get a flight down.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   It's really crazy.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   What do you mean taking them?
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.200]   You're getting on the Greyhound?
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:00.440]   No, no, we got a bus, some made sponsoring a bus for us.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.440]   So we're taking a bus.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.320]   Well, we're sponsoring the bus.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.840]   Give them a plug.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.840]   It's love sack, actually.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.840]   Love sack.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.240]   It's on the love sack.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.640]   It's a little sack of glass.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   And what is a love sack?
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.040]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.360]   It's the fat metal, isn't it?
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.160]   I think that's a...
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.520]   What is a love sack right here?
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.080]   Go Google it right now.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   S-A-C-K?
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   S-A-C.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   S-A-C.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   Oh, it's French.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   Even worse.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.080]   Here, we'll Google it on our iPhone.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   S-A-C.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   That's...
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   That doesn't.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   It's home theater furniture.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.080]   You didn't know, did you?
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.080]   I've tried.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   You didn't even know.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   I think Robert...
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   It's on me.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.080]   I'm just going.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.880]   It should be a comfortable drive then on the bus.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.480]   Yeah, we're gonna have Wi-Fi and all of that.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.080]   Are they gonna take the seats out and put bean bags all the way up and down?
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Something like that, yeah.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.440]   That sounds like fun.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   So this is like a...
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.000]   This is traditionally at CES.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.600]   You've gotta do something to get the journalists.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.480]   So you'll have a limo or you pick them up at the airport, you make them look at the
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.720]   XM satellite while you're driving them around and around and around.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.120]   So this is this time they got you for like hours.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   Like being on a boat.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.120]   Oh, that's the worst.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.840]   Yeah, never go to a Christmas party on a boat because you can't get off.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.120]   You can't get off.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.600]   It's like permanent.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.880]   I speak as if I know and in fact I do.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.080]   Yeah, so it takes one or two experiences on the boat and then you realize that you've
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   never taken invite to a boat party.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.480]   I've done many of those at Microsoft because that's standard fair.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.600]   You get taken up to Microsoft and they take you out on Kirkland, out to the Kirkland
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.800]   Pier and take you out on a boat tour for three hours.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:45.760]   Let's end on an irate note.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.920]   This story, yeah, angry, angry geeks.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.840]   This story, you have cranky geeks, John.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.640]   We've got angry geeks.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.760]   The Home Office, this comes from Times Online in Great Britain by a Dwight Silverman.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:03.360]   The Home Office has quietly adopted a new plan to allow police across Britain routinely
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.520]   to hack into people's personal computers without a warrant.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:11.600]   The move which follows a decision by the European Union's Council of Ministers in Brussels
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.320]   has angered civil liberties groups and opposition MPs.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.400]   They describe it as a sinister extension of the surveillance state which drives, quote,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.640]   "a quotian horses through privacy laws."
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.760]   It's called remote searching.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:32.640]   It allows police or the MI5 to covertly examine the hard drive of somebody at his Home Office
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.080]   or Hotel Room.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.840]   Material gatherings this way may include the contents of all emails, web browsing habits,
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:43.520]   instant messaging, and maybe used in court, police across the European Union have been
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.400]   given the green light to do this warrantless searching.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.880]   It's like being on Leo LaPorte show all the time.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.800]   In fact, here's an example.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:57.040]   Loique just said, "Stop talking about only the bad stuff at Loeb."
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.880]   And that was like, "Mike Arrington's going to storm the castle here."
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.880]   Oh man.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.480]   And he has a good point.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.520]   There was other stuff.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.840]   You know, if you're secure, in theory, somebody couldn't get in just by hacking, or is there
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   a backdoor?
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.840]   How do they get in?
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.200]   Well, that's a really interesting question.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.040]   They must want to put in back doors.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:25.480]   I mean, or maybe they use hacker techniques to get Trojans on computers.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.680]   A researcher at Cambridge University's Computer Laboratory, Richard Clayton said, "Remote
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.520]   searches have been possible since 1994.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:38.480]   An amendment to the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 made hacking legal if it's authorized
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.640]   and carried out by the state.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.360]   He said, "Athorties may break into--" This is legal.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.280]   In the EU, "May break into a suspect's Home Office, insert a key logger into an individual's
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:54.000]   computer, collect, and if necessary, transmit details to the police."
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   And they can then--
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.360]   That's a break into your house versus that, right?
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   Police may also, for instance--
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.360]   Look at all these privacy.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.280]   I was always hearing, "Oh, the Europeans are so--" "They got all this privacy stuff we
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.560]   would think, you know, I'm not seeing it."
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.040]   You know, I'm not seeing much outrage over this.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.000]   I mean, I've seen story, but I haven't seen much else beyond this.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.560]   Well, you know, Britain's notorious for the number of cameras.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.280]   By the way, you know, the FBI has done this here in this country numerous times.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   Without warrants?
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.160]   No, they probably have a warrant.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.160]   That's good, probably.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.280]   But convincing a judge to give you a warrant, I don't think is all that hard in the current
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   climate.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   No.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.480]   Especially if you have something, you know, nasty that you're studying.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.760]   So they can break in your house, put a key logger on your machine or some other technology
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.520]   on your machine, or do the usual hacky--
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.840]   Without a warrant, that's the thing I find interesting.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.160]   I mean, they basically are on their own.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.000]   If they feel like it, they can do it.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   And they can do it at the behest--
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.680]   And they can do it at the behest of another government.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:01.880]   It says in the story that if the Germans want somebody's machine in England hacked into,
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.480]   the home office will do it for them.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.520]   A remote search can be granted if a senior officer says he believes it is proportionate
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.280]   and necessary to prevent or detect serious crime defined as any offense attracting a
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.480]   jail sentence in more than three years.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   Hmm.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.080]   It's terrifying.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.000]   I don't think so, Johnny.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   You're not--
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   No, I mean, I think it is.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.160]   I mean, it's just this onerous.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.800]   I don't think it's a good thing.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.160]   I think it's probably going to end up being used for--
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.840]   I mean, for one thing, if you're suspicious of somebody for whatever reason, you can always
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.240]   jack up the complaint.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.360]   Oh, I think he's doing this.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360]   I think he's doing that.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   And that's an offense for three years.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360]   Let's go hack in his computer.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   Right.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.040]   And you go hack into the hot secretary's computer and find out who she's dating, you know,
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.440]   and see if you can get a date with her.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   I mean, I think--
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.600]   I hope that's not how it seems.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.080]   No, I'm telling you, that's what these people do.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.640]   And then the other thing is, like you always, you know, say, well, this guy's like a hot
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.520]   shot in the stock market, you know, let's--
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   He must be up to something.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520]   He must be up to something.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520]   --this thing.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520]   And I want to trade with him.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.880]   So I'm going to see what he's up to, and I'm going to get his IMs.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:16.400]   And if he's going to buy this and sell that, I want to get a piece of it.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.440]   I mean, this whole thing is just the worst kind of intrusions, because it's always used.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.040]   The good guys are the ones who misuse it.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   They're not using it.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.000]   I mean, when you boil it down, it's used to, like, essentially, you know, compromise people.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   Or for fishing expeditions.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   Well, Mark Cuban, you know, he seems like the kind of guy that might be doing insider
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   training.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Let's just check and see.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   I mean, that's something that's always been anathema in the States.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.840]   I hope that doesn't.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.840]   I guess you're probably right.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.280]   It probably is happening here, isn't it?
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.200]   Well, they're certainly watching patterns that you--
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   --pattered behavior.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   --trading patterns.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200]   --behaviour.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:49.280]   You know, I mean, if I'm watching your packets go out of your computer, and even if I don't
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.120]   know what the packets are, and I see that you do a certain pattern of packets, and then
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.880]   all of a sudden the stock market and stock goes up, and you're making a lot of money,
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.160]   I know that you were trading on that stock, you know?
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   Right.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.160]   But they've had this ability--
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160]   --Echelon.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.160]   --for the--
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.160]   --Echelon and carnival.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.600]   Well, we've wiretapped, you know, to get into drug dealers' rings and stuff like that.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   Well, you know, we've done that with a court order, right?
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.000]   This just makes it more important that people learn how to use things like true crypt, that
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.840]   they learn how to protect themselves, that they, you know, that they get more sensitive
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.840]   to this.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.320]   I've always said that the future of freedom fighting is not having a gun or it's knowing
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.320]   how to hack.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.280]   The freedom fighters in the future are going to be the hackers.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.520]   The criminals I'm worried about aren't these guys?
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520]   It's the Madoff's.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.240]   I mean, you know, why is that guy out on bail?
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.640]   Let's stop right there, Madoff.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:48.560]   Why how did Martha Stewart go to jail for like getting like a $5, you know, scam?
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.840]   This guy has ruined the lives of hundreds of people and a lot of really important charities,
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840]   and he's--
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.840]   He really won't sell his--
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.840]   --this charity was wiped out.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   Shocking.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.320]   That is terrible.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.040]   Meanwhile, Martha Stewart does time.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.160]   We put people who deal a pound of dope in jail for five years.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.760]   Well, now this is not to say that Madoff's not going to go to jail.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.160]   No, from what I'm hearing, his penalty is going to be like something like five years
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   in jail.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   For destroying thousands of people.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.440]   He hasn't even convicted or tried yet.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:27.960]   Yeah, but he destroyed thousands of people's lives and he's out on bail.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960]   I mean, if you--
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   Martha Stewart was out.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.360]   He did not get out on bail.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.920]   Yeah, well, Martha Stewart-- the point is that Martha Stewart thing is a travesty and
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   that this guy--
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.920]   So we don't know the fact that--
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.960]   --the fact that Martha Stewart would go to jail in the first place is so ludicrous
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.000]   and become a felon while this other stuff is going on at the same time, by the way.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.160]   Well, Martha Stewart was being tracked down like a dog.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.080]   That was during the year where this guy was stealing money left and right under the noses
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.000]   of the SCC, the watchful SEC.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.160]   I mean, come on.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   Not that I'm a Martha Stewart fan.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   I was just going to say, I think there's a little crush here.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   I think he's--
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   No, I really don't.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   I actually don't care much about him.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   You want to get into her kitchen?
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:17.960]   I just think she's a good example of an abusive situation and that's the only reason
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.320]   to keep bringing it up.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.520]   Well I thank you all for being here.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.720]   What a fun show this was.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.080]   It's great to see you in studio.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.880]   Robert, please come back any time you want.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880]   Thank you.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.880]   I'm not sure you're going to be able to get to the end of the show.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.880]   Get off the net!
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.880]   Dave should talk.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   Get off the net!
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   Dave actually sent me a note.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.880]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.880]   I tweeted this that the Macintosh is 25th anniversary at the end of this month.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   He's created a website for people who want to share their Mac memories of their first Mac.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   Remember your first Mac?
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   Mac25.org.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880]   You can post your thoughts there.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   Macintosh is 25.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   Remember buying our Laser Printer for $5,000?
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   Yeah, remember those?
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.880]   I had a friend who drove around in a van doing a mobile laser print.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   It was so expensive!
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   $5,000.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   Yeah, I had a $60 printer.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   That's amazing.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   It's amazing.

[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.880]   You're never going to get over that one.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880]   Never.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   Just do it.

[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.880]   I forget.

[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.880]   I can't remember.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   This is where you sing your little song.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880]   Check it next to you.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   Next with you.

[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   It's in the can.

[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880]   I did.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880]   I completely forgot.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:08.880]   [laughter]
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.880]   I was supposed to say something.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880]   Oh yeah.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.880]   It's written out here for me.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.880]   Let me see.

[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   I'm starting to feel like...
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   I left you a flat lead in and I apologize.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   I should have...
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   Show him what was I supposed to say.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   You can get this show and all the other Twitch shows on iTunes.

[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880]   Right?
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   I'm just trying to get the thing on.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880]   He can't either.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880]   [laughter]
