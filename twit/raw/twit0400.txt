[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.380]   Folks you're gonna enjoy the next few years on twit because I'm just falling apart
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.900]   And I told I was supposed to apologize to you Clayton for mistreating Natalie Morris last time she was I thought she was great
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.580]   She's I have no idea what she had a blast. Yeah, it has a blast. Oh good
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.460]   Yeah, I have no idea and look we we have the thickest skin. Yeah, you could ever find so we have great time
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.340]   Please don't tell her I apologize because then she'll start thinking of well
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.220]   What did he say and that we don't want to bring back? Yeah?
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.540]   No, I think if anything you were rooting through my my sci-fi books. We did do that
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.820]   That's what I'm supposed to apologize for do you mind?
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.060]   I got home and wondered why all my Star Trek books were rearranged why was why was number three?
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.500]   In front of number number two. I don't get that I remember my shelf
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.820]   The I'm supposed to apologize to you for Natalie now. I remember yeah, I think Devorak put her up to it
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.620]   Hey rifle through Clayton back there and find out what books he's having no
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620]   You know it gave you a new dimension
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.860]   Because we know you use the handsome
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.900]   Charming Clayton Morris of Fox and Friends the tech journalist. You're so polished
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.020]   You're kind of the James Bond of tech journalists to know that you have a little bit of a you know a geek side is good
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.420]   Oh total geek side. Yeah, you see those early James blush Star Trek novels ladies
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.300]   And when you when you like to come home with me because I can show you my my novels
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.920]   First edition also joining us
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.260]   Scott Johnson the only man in the world who has launched more podcasts than I have
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.760]   It's pretty close. Oh my god. Oh, it's been since Vegas when we were there for the enemy and I lost every category
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.860]   I was nominated new media expo, but you were nominated and it's a joy to be nominated
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.780]   Yeah, I was nice
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.100]   So it was great to see you and hang out with everybody but thanks for having me on I I have a there's a there's an interesting
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.020]   Story to be told here. I have the the notoriety of being on the last Twitter episode before you guys moved the following day
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.380]   Wow cottage and
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.940]   Now Harry I'm in a very uneventful no reason to be here today
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.180]   So that's not true because ladies and gentlemen. This is episode
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.660]   400 of Twit whoa you have trumpets to play. I know I saw that tonight the rundown. I looked at Natalie said 400
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.740]   I am honored. You know it's it's we should we should celebrate there should be but we do so many shows
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.660]   And there's always one of them crossing a hundred mark that I just don't pay any attention anymore
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.060]   But we should thank you for the present you guys sent ahead of the show that was very nice of you
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.940]   We actually we actually do have trumpets if we really want them. No, you said trombone. I think oh, okay
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.540]   But anyway 400 size, but I was saying Scott. I was just looking through your Wikipedia
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.020]   Extra life radio the instance app Slappy. Yeah, the diary of a cartoonist forecast
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.060]   That's you did that with Tom Merritt film sack. You gotta work on the names app Slappy and film sack
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.860]   I don't know current geek weekly love that hypothetical help as opposed to the real help final score the creep
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.000]   The morning stream, which is of course your morning show still on with Brian Abbott. That's a great show
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yeah, just hit 400 on that actually this is you that's that's weird and congratulations. Thank you and
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Something new you're doing with Tom. Well, you've been doing about a year now autopilot. Yeah autopilot's great because
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.780]   Speaking of nerdy stuff if people are into like TV shows and there's a ton of new TV and old TV
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.700]   But being put on streaming services like Netflix and Hulu we go and find some
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.100]   Ancient pilot to some weird show some science fiction thing everyone forgot about and we just dig in and it's a blast
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.100]   That's one of my favorite things we're doing right now
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.100]   You do that it's the morning show every morning
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.280]   Every morning Monday through Thursday. We take fries off. We're kind of with a John Stewart of puck. Yeah
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.820]   Yeah, I guess you say you know Johnny Carson. Yeah next contract. You'll take his two. Yeah, exactly
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.660]   But they I think they take the day off. I end up doing two other shows that can flex
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.980]   So it's it all works out and keeps me nice and busy
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.620]   But frog pants calm is the home of all of the above if you want to know more
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.500]   Hey sad sad note. We should mention
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.740]   Roger Ebert passed away this week at a very young age only 70 years old as I get older 70 seems younger
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.820]   and
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.380]   Of course the great film critic the guy who became famous with the gene
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.540]   siskel for
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:27.100]   At the movies and the thumbs up and all of that and a guy who really became a friend of geeks because when he
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.740]   About six years ago suffered the loss of his jaw due to
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.740]   Cancer
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.500]   He couldn't speak anymore and ended up taking to Twitter and social media like nobody's business
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.460]   Somebody said really he invented social media long before this because everything was a conversation with him
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.460]   But he sure fit in with our crowd great
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.060]   And he will be much missed well
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.000]   He always did this thing which I mean it hit me a little hard actually because when I was a kid in
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.580]   1984 I was watching him in jeans fiscal on PBS with sneak previews and thinking man
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.300]   There's nothing else like this where I get to hear about a movie before it comes out
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.260]   This is before the internet is before any any way of finding out if anything was good or bad
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.220]   And it was kind of this this really unique source, but as time has gone on
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.800]   It became pretty obvious that he was more than just a film critic who got lucky with the TV show
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.420]   He was a guy that knew when a new technology would come his way
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.980]   He knew how to tackle it and how to take it on and how to integrate it into what he already did
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.200]   And he did that with with film and TV. He did that with Twitter and did it with social media
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.540]   He has one of the most amazing TED talks I've ever heard mm-hmm
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.840]   Just a just a fantastic dude, and I'm I was real sad to hear about his passing
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.460]   It's hard to read a guy's tweet like his last tweet the day before you know that he passed away that always kind of gives me the
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.560]   Willies and I did this time to it and it was also hard to read his final blog post at the Chicago Sun Times because it was so
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.640]   Hopeful, right? I think it was about a day and a half before he passed away and he said he was you know
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.160]   Relanguishing his duties there on his daily writing and reviews. He was going to focus on the reviews that he most cared about
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.360]   The movies that he longed to see but he had to do so many other film reviews all the time
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.320]   He was going to hand the reins over to other people and it was weird to see that just about a day and a half later
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.220]   Then he passed away so full of hope you know he said he was going to continue on
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:17.180]   He was going to do some great things over at Roger Ebert calm and continue to put out content on a regular basis and then
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.900]   Maybe it was just the hope speaking I suppose
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.620]   Yeah, he'll definitely be missed so we just thought we'd mentioned that
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:32.440]   Andy and not go of course one of the writers of Chicago sometimes knew Roger and we've asked him to come on
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.660]   He didn't really want to talk on the air that days
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.460]   It was just too intense, but he did write a nice blog post at his website celestial waste of bandwidth
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.220]   Cwob.com and you know
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.380]   I think there's also really good by the
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:51.620]   Fantastic and what I think I like about it the most is it's post his cancer treatment or when all that was sort of happening in
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:58.060]   2011 and he is one of the most optimistic voices. There's nothing in that book that says woe is me or poor me
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.420]   It's just a lot of really sort of positive reinforcement about the kind of life
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.380]   He's led and why he loves film so much and it's it's really really good. Yeah
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.460]   Roger Ebert
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:13.060]   Go ahead, sorry and I have to say this I tweeted out because everyone was focusing on some of the some of the last things
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.740]   He'd written but one of my favorite one of my favorite reviews
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.340]   Ever that he did was of a star transformers revenge of the
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:28.620]   Was it revenge of the fallen to me the worst movie ever made even worse than like land nine from outer space
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.620]   Which are sort of laughable movies
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.700]   He tweeted he wrote this great piece and it said you know
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.740]   What are the worst movies he's ever seen if you want if you want to if you want to see something better
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.820]   Go in and have a children's choir scream at you banging pots and pans together
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.460]   I mean it is an epic epic takedown of the Transformers movie and if you hate that movie as much as I do
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.700]   Yeah, you will enjoy that his pants revenge really good his pants were so good
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.620]   He said once of a movie however much patrons paid to get into this movie. They'll pay twice as much to get out
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:11.820]   He's just was the best I think the best tribute to Roger Ebert though was the onions obituary of Roger Ebert
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.180]   Which they got up within minutes Roger Ebert hails human existence as a triumph
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:23.860]   Calling the overall human experience poignant thought provoking in a complete tour de force film critic Roger Ebert praised existence Thursday as an audis
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.100]   audacious and thrilling
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:32.020]   Triumph I just this really kind of summed it up and you know you don't usually think of the onion is doing
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.820]   You know heartfelt pieces and this was of course a humor piece, but it was also very heartfelt
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:42.420]   Well, it's interesting to you kind of a you had a love-hate relationship with gamers because he was very famously
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:48.620]   Sort of out in the open about how he felt like video games could never truly be art or they couldn't express art in the way that
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.580]   film or or books or you know illustration or something else could and and
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.580]   A lot of us myself included took real issue with that. I think he argued it really well
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.900]   And he had very interesting points, but I think even they would admit even these gamers were a little bit jaded by that idea
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.940]   Are you know sad to see a guy like that pass?
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.980]   He was still a pretty interesting voice in that way well
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:13.300]   And it's a shame he didn't get to play bio-shock infinite because I thought he would have started to see the potential anyway for
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.780]   Gaming really telling a story in a way that's as deep
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.060]   perhaps as as a real movie
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:29.820]   Yeah, that's an affecting piece of software. Isn't that amazing? It's amazing absolutely incredible and it's not it's the whole package
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.980]   Which I think is what he admired in film, which was right this illusion from top to bottom
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:40.740]   It's this world you're never gonna see and it's done in a way that's so polished and so well thought out and so detailed and there's good acting
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.740]   And there's good pacing and there's incredible cinematography
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:49.620]   the gameplay still there but really it takes a backseat to these other things and it is a weird irony that he that he
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:56.620]   Died just as something you could quantify as possibly and a piece of art and video games happen to come out right around the same time
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.120]   Right, we're gonna take a break cuz we'll should have a little buffer as we think about Roger Ebert
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.740]   But we'll come back
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:08.380]   We I do want to talk about Facebook home Tim is going up and down because of his 4g issues if we get it back
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:14.540]   I'd love to but if not we'll talk about Facebook home with our guests Clayton Morris from Fox and friend Scott Johnson frog pants
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:22.060]   Lots to talk about this weekend. We'll get to it in just a moment first a word from our friends at Citrix the makers of go to
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.660]   meeting
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.820]   meetings are
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.020]   unfortunately
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.180]   Kind of a must at work. I've I've hated meetings Clayton. Do you hate do you have to go to meetings?
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.820]   Like I'm an executive producer one. Yeah, I had an executive producer in Los Angeles a good day
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.780]   I'll say to me when I was at 18 years old. He said I don't know 21 years old
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.020]   He said meetings are if a meeting lasts longer than five minutes. It's worthless
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:54.260]   We used to do it standing up because we figured if you could stay standing up to the meeting that it wasn't too long of a meeting
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.660]   But as you know, you got us, you know if for if you're on a TV show you got a plan the TV show
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.740]   You got a there's a great way to be creative to share ideas to solve problems
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.900]   But how do we make meetings more effective? How do we especially with teams spread out all over the place now?
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.820]   How do we make them fast effective?
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.260]   but
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.980]   But you got to have them and that's where go to meeting is so cool first of all of course if for years
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:25.260]   They've done the screen sharing which means we're all on the same page even if we're in different places on a Mac on a PC on
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.660]   Smartphones on tablets you can join these meetings you can see the same screen and now with HD faces
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.180]   You can see the people to
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.140]   Line up on the screen on the side or on the top you're interacting with them
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.420]   You're getting body language is great for sales presentations
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.180]   You know what the clients thinking because you're seeing them watch your presentation. I
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.660]   Just I think it's a really
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.940]   Good way to make the best use of the time that you have to spend in meetings
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.700]   And I want you to try it if you if you have meetings by the way you can now present from an iPad
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.020]   The using go to meeting on iPad is kind of amazing because here you are in a relaxed environment
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.180]   Maybe you're out in the garden or you're you know at a hotel you just relax you feed up you got the iPad
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.180]   You're getting the sound from the iPad you're getting them
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:12.020]   The they're they're seeing you from the iPad screen and you're presenting it doesn't even feel like work if it's just fun
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.060]   Go to meeting calm use the promo code twit you can try this for 30 days free go to meeting
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.580]   Dot com use a promo code twit meeting is
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.540]   believing
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.300]   Go to
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   meeting
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.700]   So Thursday we talked a little bit about it
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:35.120]   Before the show I wasn't sure should we cover this Facebook event live Facebook set on an invitation saying come see
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.680]   Our new home on Android which turned out to be literally what they were showing it's called Facebook
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.460]   home, right
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.540]   Yeah, Facebook home, and it's essentially a launcher. I mean as far as I could tell it's an Android launcher
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.700]   Right and it as Mark Zuckerberg, so
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:16:01.740]   Made such a point of saying it's it's revolving around people and not applications and just a short time ago
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:08.060]   I guess just about an hour ago and perhaps Tim could be born to this they're just launched and I'm just watching it now actually
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.560]   Facebook just launched their television ad campaign for it
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.640]   And it makes you may oh my god. You want to show us see the airplane
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.680]   Yeah, is the airplane one where the guy sitting on an airplane and I think they must have like hired the Microsoft marketing team. Oh my god
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.480]   It's here. I cannot figure out. I mean
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.760]   It's a muddled nest. I mean to me. It doesn't tell me anything about that. That's actually not it
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.840]   But that's another one we could watch but there's one
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.160]   Where the guy's gear has it. Yeah, the guys get on an airplane. Let me let me
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.720]   He's walking around and it's all these weird random sort of cabaret dancers like popping
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:52.900]   We got it. We're gonna show it because it's just two it's too ridiculous and you saw it on TV because is it gonna be a TV campaign? I
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.160]   Think it's what yeah, it's gonna be a TV campaign Wow
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.280]   and
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   Yeah, it
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:06.500]   Can't be so you know I wonder if they pulled it down because I've just tried to launch it and
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.700]   Show you the chat there it is here. Here we go play the play the audio to
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.360]   So the guy's getting on a plane. He's holding his phone
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.640]   That's creepy what's up, man? He opens the luggage bin. There's people in them
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.560]   But you know nothing could be wrong with a tuba
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.040]   And here comes a drag queen
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:35.400]   Was that Alicia Keys popped out there right it's Albert Albert Keys her brother
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:41.680]   Now here's a kid with chocolate all over his face or something Brown
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.280]   Dancers this isn't this isn't gonna help old people with their impression of Facebook
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.320]   No, and the legoubriest tuba music in the background, please now the steward who says can you turn that thing off?
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   And of course he turns it back on I hate you and then he likes cats
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:13.800]   I mean it's led to believe like he's relaxed now as a result of all of these weirdos jumping out at him
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   I would be paranoid about all of these
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.320]   Connections, I've got to like this person's photo before my flight takes off
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.800]   And I don't know that you know I don't want to be that connected and I think that that's part of this big
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.760]   That's part of the larger issue with this Facebook home is you know
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.800]   How connected do we need to be how often are we gonna be connected globally?
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.400]   So someone write a smart piece about you know while you might not be connected to your location services
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.280]   You may not be giving them authorization to know exactly where you are at every moment
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.440]   But while you're sleeping from 10 p.m. Until 6 a.m.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.480]   Your phone Facebook will know that you haven't left a particular location
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.560]   We're no you're not dating so perhaps you'd like to see these young
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.760]   People of it. This is the Facebook mobile page if you thought the ad was scary
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.560]   That's the big picture on the Facebook mobile cage. It looks like cheetahs are attacking
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.760]   Some guy sleeping on an airplane. That's a Puma. What is that? That's not a cat is this literally like a
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.400]   Stepping stone toward an actual phone which has been rumored forever or is this them just saying throwing their arms up and going?
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.560]   You know what that is a business. We don't want to be in so instead
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.800]   We're just gonna give you a weird layer and call it good. They've just well first of all
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   They've denied the phone rumor forever
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   Yeah, and and I think it's clear now that it's only a phone in the it mean there is the HTC first
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.200]   Which will be available in AT&T next week. It's a cheap, you know kind of $99 mid-range Android phone
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.840]   Not a great device and by the way HTC
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:40.480]   Mentioned and if you don't like Facebook home, you can you could just use the regular launcher. You don't have to leave it on there
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's the closest they got to a phone. I think it's a good idea
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.880]   It'll be of something that's very easy to install you just download it when you install the Facebook app
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.160]   It will say on Android. I believe would you like to use us as your home page and if you say yes
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   It will modify your launcher now any anytime that you launch it. Do you do you start to hear that this music?
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:07.440]   You get the background to an M&M's
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.760]   That's the weirdest why would they choose that?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.520]   Yes, it's back. Is that what it's from?
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   You're not gonna forget it
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.880]   That's pretty great
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.960]   It sounds like elephants are stomping on me here. Well, this is why you're never gonna see us in iOS because this is
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   Right you can't see it
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   That's one of the things Zuckerberg said when he was asked he said we can't do this for iOS because we don't have access to all
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.280]   Right, right
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.920]   Is there gonna be a version of it?
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.640]   I mean much like the way we know the Google well we think Google now will be sort of an iOS eversion of Google now
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:49.200]   But not fully integrated you'd have to launch the Facebook app right because you can't take over the springboard
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   You can't take over the home page
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.080]   Right, and so it maybe the Facebook app will look that way by the way, there's no buttons
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   There's no controls. It's a lot of swiping
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.840]   When you want to chat with somebody you tap their head or whatever their image is which is gonna make some fun faces
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:08.680]   I thought that was interesting to they made a big point about how you know Zuckerberg talked about how chat is broken and
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.840]   You know in many ways
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.880]   Perhaps he's right that if you're doing other things they get in the way of the chat that you're currently having
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.600]   That it will be a persistent chat
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:24.960]   So you've got this little chat head that stays on the screen wherever you go above any other application that you're currently in
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.680]   So you can still see Instagram while you're in Instagram and you can move the little chat head
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.360]   It'll stick to the sides of the screen. It'll sort of snap to the sides
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.080]   Which I thought was interesting. I mean the design is beautiful. I have to say I mean I was blown away
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.520]   Do you feel it as some do that it's a rip off of windows phone that they were heavily inspired by windows phone?
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.840]   I think there's a lot of design aesthetics
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.880]   I mean to me this is sort of an RV red Lex Friedman's piece
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:56.360]   He over a mac world a few weeks ago. He had abandoned his iPhone for a while to go strictly windows phone
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.720]   It was pretty funny. He said you know at the end of the whole journey
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.600]   He wanted to create like a franken phone right bringing in like the best parts of all three
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:10.920]   Experiences windows Android and iOS and I think in in many ways you're seeing some of that here in the notifications are clean and nice
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.800]   You're getting to see that persistent information on the front screen like you some of the tile features that you're talking about from windows
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.920]   That's a we're just seeing an iPhone
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.680]   You know, I mean it's just a bunch of icons with with numbers on them as them
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   But is the best you can do on the iPhone I?
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   I'm getting I'm buying an HTC one. I decided the HTC one to me is the closest thing to an iPhone running Android
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.600]   beautiful hardware it will
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:43.000]   One I will be able to install home on it home will install a galaxies. I believe the note
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.280]   Yeah, Alex is three and S4 and S2 will it will install on the note one. I don't think so right
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.720]   Maybe not just a no, no, it's some some late model. So I will absolutely install it
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.800]   It's easy to turn a launcher on and off. So it's an easy thing to do
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.640]   Wonder if we're a little bit right. Pardon me. Sorry. Next is forward run it right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.280]   I don't know I saw the list and I don't it seemed to me that most of the late model Android phones be just fine with it
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.400]   One thing I think is interesting that's going on with with fate
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.880]   You know, I don't know if you recall there's a great wired magazine piece
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.000]   Maybe almost five years ago now talking about sort of the cold war between Google and Facebook and you know
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.720]   Google being open having access to all the searchable information
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:29.680]   But sort of the white whale of data was what was being held behind the wall of Facebook and now you have Facebook
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.040]   Sharing this experience on Android how much of that information is available to Google if any?
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:42.120]   Ah, that's interesting. Everybody's asking how much is available to Facebook, but you're saying how much is available to Google
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:48.160]   Right, I mean it struck me this week that Google has long wanted the information that Facebook had and Facebook kept closed
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.440]   You couldn't you know when you do Google search up until what about two years ago?
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.160]   You couldn't get any of the information that was behind that wall be valuable data think about the stuff that people are sharing on Facebook
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.120]   That they're not sharing on Google. I mean, that's why we have Google plus, right?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:06.040]   So why don't Google would but maybe that I don't that's an interesting question
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.160]   I'm really thinking I mean it's just running on the Android kernel on top of everything
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.240]   It's not I don't think running separately does Android send how much does it send back to Google?
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.920]   How much does it send back to the handset maker? How much does it send back to the wireless carrier?
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.800]   All three are involved in the making of this phone
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:28.780]   I don't think there's a Google's but by the way at Danny Sullivan search engine land pointed out to get to Google search from Facebook
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.560]   Home is two clicks. It's buried in there
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:37.400]   I would true, but if you think there's a lot of there's a lot of I mean
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.800]   There's a lot of answering on on Android, you know if you set up a new Android phone
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.200]   I just I was doing something with the galaxy note to the other day
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.000]   And you know when you're spending up different apps or you're launching different things within the Google services
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.160]   You're constantly being asked to send data back to Google of course like you would in iOS to you know
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.040]   When you first launch it that so I wonder you know if
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.600]   How much of this information if you're using Facebook information you're liking this cat picture
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.120]   And then of course we know that ads are coming right Zuckerberg was very forthcoming that ads. Yes, they are coming
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:15.920]   Which also brings up this whole minority report style idea of using Facebook Facebook home in this geolocation era
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.760]   When all of these ads are sort of popping up it contextually how much information does Google have is this a?
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.760]   You know I thought it was sort of a Trojan horse for Facebook, right? They don't have to build their own phone
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:34.240]   They get to use an open platform in Android and they get to do this entire experience that doesn't look anything like
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.640]   like the Android experience
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   much
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.840]   Important report connection because this is keeps coming up lately and there was an article and I wish I could point to it now
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.920]   I wish you could tell Chad where it is, but there's an article that I just read recently that talked a whole bunch about how the design aesthetic of
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.720]   That movie was so powerful and driving designers to try to reach that
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:01.120]   Oh, we all want this pinch and zoom and separate and there's been visible screen stuff that we've actually gotten to a point now
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:08.440]   where we're implementing those design essentials and that it's a mistake that it's not good design that it's that it causes us all kinds of
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.680]   Problems down the road and some would point to windows 8 issues with some of the interface stuff with the way they've done it
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.780]   The way the Xbox 360 tries to integrate this stuff. Oh, yeah
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:23.840]   Even that Samsung television you guys played the big that's from the all Christian Brown's chair. Yeah
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.680]   Remember that guys last year that Samsung television where you put a stand in swipe
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.400]   Yeah, just and now there's a commercial for that Samsung television saw the other day and it looks the guy looks ridiculous
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.760]   It's like he's grabbing in the air like mid-air like he's you know
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.720]   We've all tried to connect on the Xbox and that doesn't work very well to the this
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.480]   And it's not intuitive and then of course leap motion is coming out
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   And those are basically minority report and Samsung remember that bizarre
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.080]   Launch event that I'm sure you were at Clayton where they showed that you don't have to touch the screen
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.800]   You have minority report style gestures you can do in front of the screen. So it's it's here
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.040]   And I agree. I don't think it is exactly what we want to be doing
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:11.760]   Just a question of will who will suss out and get to the point where it is the way we want to use it
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.200]   I mean you could look at every single platform and say well
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.560]   They've all taken pieces of those ideas and tried to integrate them and some are a little more flashy than others
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.960]   But one of the big kicks again against Apple right now in iOS's current state is that that really hasn't changed since 2007
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.080]   And we're all using the interface and essentially the same way all these years later. It's a conservative road
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.280]   It while while everybody else is saying look I can make stuff move with my hand without even touching the thing
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.200]   And that seems flashy or more interesting and more sort of cutting edge
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.840]   But the argument of this article wasn't even in favor of Apple
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.880]   It was just saying we may not really want to go down this road because when we get to the end of it
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.440]   We're gonna go none of this is practical in the end. Well, wait a minute remember what we were we were influenced before
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.440]   The minority report we have influenced by 2001 a space odyssey
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.840]   We wanted to converse with our computers and that didn't happen because it's hard to do and you look like a moron going computer
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.880]   You know give me that so so now so I don't know if minority important
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.920]   Vented this or they knew a little bit about what was already kind of coming. I'm not sure what the genesis of it is
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   But it's it's clearly
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.720]   An attempt by designers to come up with a new user interface the mouse the keyboard
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.880]   This is all kind of dated the keyboard is 150 years old for crying out loud
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.200]   Wouldn't it and everybody thinks well, there's got to be a better way if if it's not voice maybe it's gestures
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.840]   Maybe it's a combination
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.080]   There are maybe it's touch. I have to say when using windows 8 which I'm doing in front of me
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:43.000]   Of course Microsoft had to add new ideas to gestures to accommodate the broad variety of controls and the idea of you know
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.920]   everything is sweeping in from the edge and
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.080]   You close applications by sweeping down and over and there's just all sorts of new
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.880]   Counterintuitive or at least not discoverable gestures a lot of these are not gonna make the cut
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.600]   Yeah, I think I mean there's something maybe to be said for skeu morphism in this right
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.880]   I mean we don't know how to I mean certainly when someone's sitting down for the first time where they go to a best
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.680]   By they're gonna use one of these windows 8 machines
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   That's my biggest gripe against it and exactly your point right to close an application within windows 8
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   You have to swipe down from the top of the screen
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:21.520]   But you don't know that because there's no trash can there to let you know that you're swiping this away
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.520]   And it only appear does it even appear when you swipe it down it only here's what happens here
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.660]   So I've got one note open I'm gonna swipe down from the top and it's going to make one note get small now
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:38.760]   I can do different things if I sweep over to the left one note now occupies a gutter and now I'm really confused
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:45.360]   If I if I sweep down and to the off there it goes away
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.600]   Right and so these are not discoverable
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:55.680]   I know I and I don't think the charms on the right side of the screen like you have that there's the the the main home screen there
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.640]   Right on the right side of the screen you would think okay
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.560]   Yeah, then you pull these charms up right those like pop up those aren't those aren't there those aren't discoverable
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   You don't know that there's even exist and if you don't know it by the way
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.320]   You'll never figure out how to turn the machine off because turning off the machine is hidden in charms
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.920]   settings power
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.080]   off
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:22.120]   So what Scott Scott brings up a great point about iOS. I wonder how many people I mean I'm sure I'm I'm positive
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:28.160]   No one in my family knows about gesture controls. I mean my wife's you know a tech nerd
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.760]   You used to work for C net for crying out loud
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:37.880]   She never uses she never uses all of the you know, hey like five finger swipe to get between apps. I occasionally do it
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.400]   but
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   Or the five pinch down like you're grabbing an apple out of the mid-mid air right to close an application
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.560]   I don't think anyone uses those I'd be really curious to see the stats
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.840]   I use them constantly, but you're totally right. It's because you had to learn them
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.760]   I yeah, I read an article and said hey guess what justice are now on the iPad suite
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.720]   I was waiting for these but nobody else really cares
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.480]   I think that honestly I believe apples attempt to go more
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:07.560]   Schimorific in the past to say hey the calendar app looks like paper or the the gap looks like real pages
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.680]   they've stuck to that motif I don't think because
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.760]   They are married to it or anything
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.120]   But I think that they believe fundamentally and I could be wrong about this
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.960]   But fundamentally that the idea of having a trash can on the desktop makes sense to people having a folder to put other
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.160]   Documents in seems like a thing you could do in real life
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.360]   Yeah
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.800]   And they think there's some value in that from a kind of how people's brains are trained
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:37.000]   standpoint, right that being said I think Google or Google's the guys that have the right way this new sort of approach
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.200]   They have even with their iOS apps this kind of flat. Let's try to not take everything
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.720]   Click a 3d button sort of approach is is one
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.200]   I think people can get their heads around without you know all this trouble
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:54.800]   So I mean we're making strides but and to be fair to Microsoft that's Metro 2 is flat no great it
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:02.080]   No gradients no shadows no rounded bubbles. Yeah, right so that and that's and I think that that's modern in fact
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.160]   according to some Johnny I've who is a big
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.500]   Proponent of flat and really doesn't like skeuomorphism. This is a buzz of that. It's some syllables
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   Yeah, it's for excuse to amorphousism
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:21.180]   Is going flat in the next version of iOS so I suspect but you know design is funny design is all trendy, right?
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.760]   So fins are in fins are out. It's so you know
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:31.340]   Gradients are in gradients are out flat is in and in three years. We'll go that flat was so boring, you know, right?
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.340]   I want chintz chintz everywhere
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.620]   One thing you the real bad example is like the old station wagons with wood paneling on right
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:46.420]   I do too, but I only love them ironically like they were kind of a terrible idea because what he they were trying to fool us that they had
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.620]   Wood on the side of these cards and they never could have wood in them. It was ridiculous
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:57.380]   People bought it. It was a thing. Oh, I call it. We want this we we want this futuristic iPad, right?
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.640]   It's all aluminum body and we love it and yet we're gonna order a bamboo case
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:09.780]   Now you got to give apple credit because the first few gestures were pretty intuitive
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.780]   The idea of tapping
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.460]   Pinching zooming that all of those I think people got them right away in fact
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.640]   You just mentioned that miles you're two-year-old uses the iPad fluently, right?
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.780]   Absolutely, and when you this was fantastic this was
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:32.820]   Astonishing he was about he was about 12 months old also known as one year and I he was within I mean within a few months
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:38.100]   I mean maybe six seven months old he was already swiping between apps on the iPad could launch the videos app to watch
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.580]   They might be giants music videos. We had on there the kids albums and and could launch the videos app
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.140]   then I handed him the first iteration of the Kindle fire and
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.620]   He handed it back to me and didn't know what to do with it
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.260]   I wanted to pay wanted pad pad back again. He couldn't figure it out
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:00.780]   There's something to be said for those types of gestures. You're talking about though, which seem intuitive. You're touching a screen
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.860]   You could swipe between them and that's really the only time when I'm using the Chromebook pixel
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.700]   Where I'm I feel like okay scrolling that makes sense for me to have a touchscreen
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.380]   I just don't feel like using the trackpad at this moment
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.420]   I'm just gonna swipe up and touch here
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:21.620]   It does not make sense for me to do certain other gestures on on the Chromebook pixel, but you know touching pinching
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.700]   There's a picture makes a lot of sense. The problem is we need more
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:30.220]   If you're gonna get rid of the command line or you're gonna get rid of menus and mice
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:36.580]   Then we need more capabilities and that's when you start having well, you'll sweep in from the side to get the charms bar
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:43.180]   Right and suddenly it's gone from intuitive obvious to you got to know where to go and what to do
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:48.580]   And that's back to the old days of you might as to me. It's as counterintuitive as a command line
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:54.580]   You know you can learn the command line now. What do you think about leap-lump motion of either of you guys played with that?
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.340]   I have a no
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:02.420]   So the idea is it's a little square thing you put in front of your keyboard and you can now kind of
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:08.300]   You're doing some of the same gestures, but much more minority report like you're doing it in front of the screen
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:16.860]   Right, it's a little I did see video of this. Yeah, it's basically it's a high fidelity connect sort of experience where you're
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.900]   Obviously there are some gaming applications, but mostly it's about manipulating objects
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.900]   I guess somebody using it to do
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.420]   3d work in AutoCAD's yeah, one of their mud programs
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:32.300]   In 3d. Yeah, that's that's kind of awesome actually. It's gonna be out coming up May 13th
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.780]   So well here's one of this pretty cool reminds me of those dresses a very specific thing for me as an artist and illustrator
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.380]   I have been trapped in the whole Wacom Photoshop
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.300]   high-powered Mac Pro Tower world for a long time and
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.180]   We're all now being told as artists and professionals
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.460]   Guess what touch screens are the future better get used to it
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.580]   But none of the touchscreen solutions are are addressing the kind of
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.940]   Meta work I have to do it doesn't like you said Leo
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:07.580]   You don't have the control you got to come up with weird ways of doing old things and I just throw my hands up
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.300]   Go look I just need a mouse. I need a keyboard
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.580]   I need shortcuts and I need a wacom tablet and I'll get your big 20 by 30 poster by by midnight tonight
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.220]   Do you use this in teak? I do I have it back behind me here a centique
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.300]   21 inch I'm real tempted by those 24s, but anyway, so that's that's a monitor
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:28.220]   That's a touch monitor basically that you can use a stylus to draw on your drawing correct correct
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:34.180]   They're 24 inch they have two versions one that uses a pen only for input and the other uses both touch and pen
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:41.260]   and the beauty of these is they have many many thousands of of pressure points so you can really recreate whatever sort of media
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:47.100]   You're working in and it's what professional artists use it is just flat the standard and that is how it is
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.500]   So when you know I is excited about tablets as I am I own five open this house or whatever it is
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:59.180]   Nobody's shown me anything yet including adobe including any other professional graphics packages that said here is a thing that could potentially
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.560]   Replace how you work how you really get work done?
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.700]   It's what movie editors say everybody who works in a professional way needs some big honkin machine on their desk
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.820]   Or at least a notebook with similar capabilities and that hasn't been answered yet. I don't know what the transition point for that is
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.540]   I don't know what the drop-off is but it scares some of us like old men telling people to get off our lawn
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.720]   It's a little weird you guys are getting as old as me any day now. Here's the leap motion in
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.980]   In action. This is at leap motion calm here. That's just this little thing
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.580]   I guess it's got a camera in it so you can
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:36.100]   Move your so you can scroll by flicking now. You're not touching the screen. You're just gesturing
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.400]   See I'm worried your arm is gonna get tired if you have a lot of this. This is cool
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.940]   Lee of you use it like use the pixel yet. I have a pixel. Yeah
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.800]   And I find you know, I mean this is I think this is exactly what Steve Jobs was talking about
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.860]   No one wants to hold their arm out there for that long
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.260]   Well, and now this is also the machine I'm using is a Acer S7. It's a Windows 8
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:05.580]   Laptop ultra book with a touchscreen and I do like the option to sometimes touch so you said
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.660]   Clayton when you're reading it's natural to scroll and it is natural to scroll
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.340]   So to be able to sometimes touch and scroll and sometimes use the mouse
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.780]   It's nice to have all of these those available. You wouldn't want to always be doing that
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.780]   Right, but once in a while you go. Oh, yeah, it just feels natural
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:28.900]   And I think partly that's because we've all lived down at universe where you use tablets a lot and I
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:34.660]   Guarantee you every one of you has to come to the situation where you've touched the screen on your laptop and it didn't respond
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.660]   You go. Yeah, right. I forgot right
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:44.780]   The sort of reminds me do you see that that infrared keyboard that right plug in another stupid idea that never took
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:50.020]   You know this sort of reminds me I mean there was a rumor floating around this week about the Apple TV again
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:56.380]   No, I don't you saw the gene monster added again. Yeah, no, it was not there is no Apple television set
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:01.620]   Just forget I loved about it was this idea that you were gonna slip on a ring to read that part of the story
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:06.020]   You're gonna slip on a ring that Apple and it was going to interface with the Apple TV
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.360]   So you could then in mid-air be able to swipe around with this ring that you're able to put on and
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:16.140]   Come on. What's too many episodes of the Hobbit? I think I don't this well even in that but see that's not unlike say something like a
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:23.380]   PlayStation move which is really just a big bulky version of that idea the idea of having a tracking device that it can hone in on and track
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:29.940]   Motion is not unbelievable, but the idea of in my house with my kids having a ring someplace
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:35.500]   Oh, dude, we better give me a dozen X or something. Yeah ridiculous
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.260]   The devil TV goes missing every five minutes
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.460]   I actually bought it
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.660]   You put it pants
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.560]   I get up
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.260]   You know kids are doing something and it's like this big and you just slide it your pants and you come back
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:53.540]   And I go now where kids where'd you put that Apple TV remote? Ah?
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.980]   It's in my pants
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:02.700]   Never thought of that Clayton, but I'll have to start my it's next I fit bit. They're closing up for the I
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:10.620]   Actually bought another remote because I don't know where my Apple TV remote when I went out and bought a new one
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   It's a thing you probably ate it in a sandwich and you didn't even know
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.820]   Sometimes I get hungry in the middle of the night. I don't know what I'm eating
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.420]   I like to walk in with an apple remote room where I know there about 10 max in there people are over
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.180]   They're doing whatever you hit play and everyone's every one of them
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.700]   Ridiculous
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:37.900]   Okay, you can program I might realize that chat room. I know you can turn it off
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:46.140]   By default, it's on yeah. Yeah, it's my watch MacBook Pro all the time. Yeah, we've all very so you're wearing
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.540]   You're wearing a new bracelet there. So this this you didn't lose this one in your pants. What is that?
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:56.220]   No, this is the Fitbit flex and this is a demo unit version of it. So it kind of looks like Knight Rider
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.980]   You saw this at CES of course the demo units there, but this is they're about this is not the final version
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.100]   It doesn't it doesn't close very
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.020]   Sustainably so they're trying to work on making it just snap very nicely
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:14.380]   But you tap the front of it and that kind of has like a Knight Rider little interface that kind of pops up there
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.220]   You look like they're also on yeah
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.060]   Yeah, it has like a silent little interface
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:24.060]   It does not have the altimeter like the other Fitbit does, you know where it can count how many steps you're going up
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:29.820]   Uh, but they did some amazing technology with this and they did some really cool things because I asked them
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:35.740]   How you know if i'm i've got a walking desk at home, right? So now i've got the treadmill. Well, how's it gonna know that my hands
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:41.420]   You know i'm walking but my hands are just here on the keyboard and they said they spent a lot of time
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:48.380]   Studying and perfecting it so that even if you're just typing and you're walking it'll know it'll know that's oh that's good
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.860]   And if you're a stroller it'll know your hands are on a stroller
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:58.620]   But you're also getting points because it knows that you're actually walking and it knows the difference if you're driving and knows you're not walking
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.540]   Yeah, I did a really remarkable job with it
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.500]   Yeah, I had the Nike fuel ban and uh, I ended up putting around my ankle when I was on the stairmaster
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:10.060]   But nothing nothing senses Pilates it thinks you're just sitting on your ass
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.780]   Yeah, and maybe you are frankly the whole time you're not moving that little flower just shrinks down
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.820]   I don't think this is exercise. I don't know what you're doing
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:26.060]   But I don't but they're hoping for uh, they're hoping for a spring release of of the fitbit
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.260]   Everybody's doing this college and doesn't isn't sam song
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:35.260]   I didn't they announce that they get s4 that they're gonna do a bracelet too and a new scale and a bra you know a bunch of stuff
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.460]   Yeah
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.060]   Again, it's that sort of qua you know quantified life idea, right?
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.140]   But you know, I love being able to look at this data
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.420]   I love being able to see the information and and know that uh, you know
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.740]   I've lost this amount of weight because I've stepped on this particular scale. It sinks over. Why?
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:54.540]   I fi it's all tied to the kind of food that I'm counting, you know, using the the lose it app and then it's also
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.660]   You know, it's all all them work together because fitbit works with lose it so that they have the partnerships there
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.100]   I like lose it so it's fuel bands fuel bands about do for an update, isn't it?
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.340]   They've got something new from like
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.540]   I think it's got the best software right now, right?
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:13.500]   Yeah, in fact, they have a whole new dashboard interface that they're rolling out for the apps too
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.020]   So it has a very again the sort of windows 8 aesthetic
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:23.020]   With these tiled features can sort of move the tiles that you want really need community features
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.380]   You can share with your friends so their whole new dashboard is overhauled as well
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.700]   I got a sneak peek at that this week as well
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.780]   So some really nice stuff between those guys and I love you know, I really do love
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.700]   I mean on an android device using NFC if you just want to check your stats for the day
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.700]   You don't even need to sync it with your just tap it
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.980]   Just tap it right on the back end it launches the fitbit app
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.460]   Right there and shows you where you are with your steps for the day pretty cool. You convinced me
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.980]   I've lost about four fitbits
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.220]   I left one at the San Diego Zoo
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.260]   One in Paris, one in a toilet somewhere in Vermont
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.660]   but I
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:00.300]   That one's still tracking me by the way, I've seen I've seen the the points from that panda
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.820]   He's running around for as well
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.020]   20,000 steps panda's being I got the Ling Ling Fitbit
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.860]   So but I but I like the bracelet. I used to have it. I have the jawbone up
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.940]   I have the Nike I do you know, I like you I probably try all of these this one looks good
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.940]   I might I might get this one
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.420]   It's sturdy all the standard fitbits are so easy to lose. I ended up losing two of them
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.220]   and they
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.060]   Man, they were awesome about replacing them though. I lost one in the laundry. I quit working
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.900]   Called them up and they said no problem really nice. I'm doing you that's nice
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.380]   I forgot to mention waterproof
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.300]   Oh, yeah, so they shower with you good. Uh, which is really cool
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.900]   I mean you don't have to take it off every day and lose it
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:43.580]   So you can just take a right and shower with you too. Do they claim proof or do they claim resistant the Nike fuel plan was always resistant
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.740]   They're common to me where you can wear it in the shower. Now. I don't know about deep seed diving looking for sponges
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.780]   I was always afraid to so I just I never did
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.220]   I always wanted to be a sponge diver. Yeah
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:03.260]   I'll do prefer for 80 meters. Yeah, you gotta go a long ways
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.660]   Uh, we're gonna go just gonna loofah
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:09.580]   People make fun of these and they really are just fancy pedometers
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.860]   But there's something I always found there was something about wearing them and knowing you were being monitored
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:19.500]   That made you take the stairs. It just I always felt like I'll get a little more exercise because somebody's watching my little fit bits watching
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:25.900]   And it doesn't for sure. We're good when you get the alerts the push notifications that you're 2,000 steps away from your daily goal
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.140]   You take an extra you do you go for a walk?
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:34.460]   Sure and I've lost 22 pounds. I mean I've lost 22 pounds as a result of of tracking this information wait a minute
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.860]   You gain the same one pound 22 11 times or something. You know where with
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:47.260]   I was at uh, forgive my math, but I was at about 198 ish when was it all in your ass? Where I don't see any
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:53.900]   You look the same my face my chest now is a little puffy and uh, I am 62
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.100]   So I kind of it spreads out, you know, it's like a long-gated man
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:01.180]   Uh, but I just imagine the the giant expanding buttocks
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.740]   I don't know why
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:08.940]   Is his life said you had no ass before now you I can't there's no ass there. It's gone completely
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.980]   Oh, yeah, oh you're suffering from uh, what what a producer mind once called male pattern ass loss
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.100]   And uh, there's no cure
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:24.060]   Real quick plating there's some comic nerd points for mentioning elongated man. I just want to point that out
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:29.580]   All right. All right. That's some nerdy thing that you guys got going on between the two. Yeah, I don't know
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.900]   I didn't go for I didn't go for mr. Fantastic. I went for elongated man
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.740]   Yeah, which no one thinks is a real guy which no one thinks the actual comic book character
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.220]   And he is and that is just that's awesome. Is he related to particle man?
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   No, okay, universe man. No
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:52.140]   Universe man universe since you mentioned they might be giants we thought we threw this thing in law dc comics
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:58.620]   He first appeared in the flash in the 1960 elongated man is randolf ralph dibney
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.900]   Hmm. Yep
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.860]   For the death this week by the way and scott can speak to this another death carmine
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:12.380]   And tino the creator of the flash more and more common, right like brombin just died again
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:18.940]   Um, this is a way. This is how the big comic companies get our attention and want us to go buy more books as they start killing off important characters
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:24.620]   Eventually come back either of the new wait a minute. No, he's talking about a real person. Sorry scott. You're getting confused here
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.180]   Oh, you're talking about carmine and fantino the creator of the flash. She was 87 years old
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.340]   He's not a comic book character. Although he looks kind of like one in his scary picture. Yeah, he's great. He's amazing
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.940]   Yeah, he passed away
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.740]   He yeah, I mean at a time like he just passed away. He brought batman back from the dead
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.420]   I mean he was uh, really batman was really yet people were not buying the comic books
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:53.420]   People were not buying the golden age flash people didn't care and he created that modern red and yellow flash costume and uh when when dc
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   Came to him basically said we need to revive this
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:01.180]   Uh because the the horror books and the crime novels were being uh, clamped down on by the authorities
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.540]   They thought they were too
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:07.980]   Lued right people couldn't read them. So he he revived batman gave them that silver age look
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.940]   Uh the flash and batman and really gave him that whole 20-year design aesthetic
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.780]   So we we owe carmine
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.220]   We think we can thank him for really saving batman and saving the flash
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.540]   Yeah, and quite honestly
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:26.460]   Possibly saving comics from a weird time like the silver age is largely responsible
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:32.460]   It's he is largely responsible for for that insurgents that for that period and a lot of people don't like the silver age
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:37.180]   But I think it was a crucial stepping stone and we talked about him on on comic dorks the other night
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.580]   And there's a lot of reverence in the comic industry and most people don't even know who he is
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.860]   So yeah, go to wikipedia. Look at look him up. He's a he's a cool guy
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.580]   Silver age was when
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.060]   1950 to 1970
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.380]   When I would have been reading comic books if I'd been as big a nerd as you guys
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.860]   Yeah, you know
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:01.660]   All the weird stuff came out that that weird like pilt hat
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.980]   Like this weird
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.220]   condom hat, you know the original flash
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.780]   uh, it was a cheap caror
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:14.460]   And then uh he drew like the really sort of modern sleek, you know designs for a comic book
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.380]   So it went from being really really kitschy
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:22.460]   To more modern and a lot of the same costumes that we know and love of batman and the flash like that particular costume
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.660]   You're looking at there
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.980]   Uh that he he came up with that. Yeah, it's essentially stayed unchanged
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.820]   I mean, it's it's been modernized and tweaked here and there but his his designs
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.980]   Probably held more than anybody else's he's he's uh, he was a pioneer for sure
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.260]   Well, that's nice. We're gonna take a break
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.860]   uh
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.620]   It's so funny because we had last week I really thought we were gonna get comic book talk
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.580]   Because we had like big comic book guys on and we didn't really
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:52.700]   And this week we did but of course, I mean these guys of course, of course, what am I?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.460]   What am I thinking?
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.620]   Um before we get off the facebook home
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.180]   Will you guys try it?
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:04.140]   Uh, yeah, i'll tell you yeah, yeah, in fact, I I asked for it immediately and i'm kind of looking forward to it
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:08.300]   I think it looks beautiful. I really do. Um, I won't keep it
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:13.660]   I can tell I can tell that you know a week later. I'll be off of it again, but i'll try it for a while
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:18.060]   Well, you'll be on the front. It seems like for people who if you give a smartphone to your 16-year-old
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:22.300]   And all they care about is facebook, you know updates and photos and all that
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:28.300]   That this is great. This is perfect for them. That's kind of what I was thinking is that we're the wrong audience for this
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.140]   Right, right, but are we that's I mean, I we didn't really touch on this and then you have to do a break
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.060]   I mean we can talk about this the other side of the break
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:39.260]   I don't want to hijack your show. Um, but they I mean the idea of who who are they marketing this to?
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.580]   Right, you see that commercial normal people
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:48.300]   Normal people or is it uh, is it teens because you know, I think we see this we see this don't do facebook anymore
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.340]   I just want to point this out. They do instagram. They just snap chat
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:56.620]   They do not do facebook and youtube is the number one social network among young folks
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.980]   Yep, youtube
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.380]   If I look at my kids who are 18 and 21
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.940]   Now insta I think facebook
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.500]   Knew this was coming. That's why they spent a billion dollars on instagram
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:11.340]   I think they realized that there was a they were hemorrhaging younger people to these new platforms
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.620]   But totally that's all they do is instagram
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:20.860]   Not twitter twitter's for old people facebook's kind of becoming for your mom to keep track with their high school buddies
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.740]   It's becoming you know classmates dot com
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.460]   Right kids don't care
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:31.660]   This is for their instagramming their vining their snap chatting their snapchat
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.060]   Yeah, and nobody used poke
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.860]   They made a snapchat version of poke nobody's using that
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.300]   No
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:43.580]   I mean, I know after the breaking up in the rundown too. Maybe talk about the streaming music services. Yeah, that's about
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.940]   Yeah
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.020]   And you know we may talk about that and as it relates to how you know most people are listening to youtube
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:53.980]   Most kids are listening to youtube and that's where they get their music exactly so and the me
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:58.300]   I think the music industry thinks this is a little bit of a problem. That's why they move vivo off of youtube
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.460]   I think they're very worried
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.460]   YouTube's the new mtv
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.020]   If you want music videos you go to youtube
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.700]   So much more too because if they if they find a show or let's say they find I don't know a
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.660]   Band they like and they they know the video is going to be there
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.460]   How it I could in two minutes here. I could go to any just and beaver video right?
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.540]   I haven't forbid I do but let's say I did
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:24.220]   I could go record in really good even analog fashion the music right off of that video
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.700]   And i've got the mp3 and i can share with my friends
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.020]   I get the whole new brand of piracy and it doesn't feel like piracy. They thought piracy
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.660]   It's not it's just you're capturing it's it's weird. It's a weird
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.940]   Do youtube is freaking weird leo? It's a weird thing
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:44.300]   I don't think about what it is now and what it was and what it will be it is effing weird
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:49.420]   Well, my wife is launching a youtube show and she's been working on it for months and months and months
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.380]   And i'm really excited about it and all the research they have a discussion with
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:57.260]   Um with youtube about some things and one of the most popular things on youtube right now
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.460]   In fact, not even one of those I think the most popular thing is called
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.420]   Uh, what is it called?
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.540]   mall
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.060]   mall calling
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.620]   Chad, do you know what i'm talking about is that where they uh drive up to drive in windows and they and they
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.860]   No, no, no mall's young girls. Yeah, what is it called? I have to texture about this
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:20.140]   My stream cone and they just grab it with their hand. That's not what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, I like that
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.060]   I watched that one
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.820]   The girls they go to the mall
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.940]   They buy a bunch of clothes in their bags they come back and sit in front of their webcam and try them on
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.500]   And they show no they show the clothes they bought or they show the items that they purchased
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:38.540]   And these videos have hundreds of thousands of clicks and youtube says these are the number one videos right now in youtube
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.900]   It's actually why
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.260]   You know why because they keep thinking they're gonna take off their clothes and they never do
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:49.020]   Right, maybe but with a bunch of horny boys going come on take it off. Take
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.700]   Chad you can you can
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:58.140]   Deal with this. I mean the one of the biggest things on youtube is people walking around in video games and just playing a game
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.380]   Right that's twitch commentary. That's twitch. It's twitch is good at the live stuff
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:07.180]   But the archive stuff you have I mean the yoggs cast is a good idea. It's called. It's called. Let's plays
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:13.100]   I talked to a 10 year old today who has a youtube channel of minecraft how to's right
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:19.260]   And and every kid I know is making minecraft videos like anybody's nobody's watching them, but they're making them
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:24.540]   Yeah, we're like like right now the the big thing that I'm watching on youtube is the minecraft server
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:30.780]   Which is a server of minecraft players. They just came out with an ultra hardcore series and and we're in episode three
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.220]   And every two days they they release a new video and it's just like
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.980]   I have to watch the next video and each of those videos are 30 minutes long. I want to see multiple people's perspectives
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:45.020]   That's an hour and a half of content. I am in the long field. I could tell that's really weird
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.580]   I'm telling you it's the weirdest thing but that's the future
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.460]   It's happening in front of us. What's really funny is how little youtube gets this because they said
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.740]   Oh, let's put 300 million dollars into traditional broadcast style shows
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:04.460]   Let's get these guys to upgrade their videos and nobody I think of the of the new youtube channels
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.100]   If any uh none if any maybe one maybe source feds made its money back
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.980]   nobody else meanwhile
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.980]   this
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:22.140]   Wandering around minecraft and that's that's crazy. But youtube doesn't want this to be successful. I can tell you right now
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.340]   This there's no model for this. They don't get it
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.820]   But this is where the future is
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.740]   They didn't sound sad in a by the way my wife texted me. It's called shopping hall
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:37.820]   H a u l is this trend if you search for shopping hall, okay, you hold your shopping
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:42.220]   Yeah, but you know women do this anyway. They're just now they're putting it on youtube
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:47.180]   Right and maybe that's why it's so successful. It's voyeurism. It's oh she got this great deal
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:51.580]   No, because they can't get their husbands to go along with it because I know my ex-wife used to do that all the time
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.660]   You want to see what I got? I said no
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.980]   I do not
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.500]   I do not want to see what you got right doesn't just Natalie do that to you
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.660]   Would you like to see what I got?
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:07.580]   Yeah, she knows better than to show me because I see a box of shoes arrive and I said oh didn't we just have a talk about not spending too much money
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:11.340]   She well, I don't know but then she'll she'll be happy to show me the little kids
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.740]   You know ava's little onesies that she ordered like here's her spring dresses
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:19.900]   Here's the fall haul. I got some mac. I got some lush. I got some target and more
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.100]   Come on. Let's go watch what I just bought at the mall
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:27.980]   How many how many views half a million views half a million freaking views?
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:32.300]   That makes me want to just that makes me want to set fire to things. I don't understand this one
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:38.060]   This is a we see i'm telling you as guys who are creating content and I do some of my own, but I mean
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.100]   This has got a chapter ass
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.500]   You know, it's well shot. I gotta tell you though. That's professionally shot
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.900]   This is the one I got this is not that look at this. This is professionally shot
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:57.980]   It's well, it may be professionally lit, but the shot is all DSLR. That's that yeah, that's that soup
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:02.220]   I mean, that's not even tell look at the background. It's yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's not even a natural like
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:05.260]   Yeah, it's super this is shot and lit
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:12.220]   But what's the difference between professionally made up I might add too so so back in the day xkcd
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.860]   Which I love launched a comic right and everybody went crazy for it, especially in the tech crowd
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.860]   Everyone loves xkcd
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.900]   And cartoonists everywhere crap to their pants because what they saw was stick people
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.780]   And they've been training their whole lives to draw well
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:31.420]   And he's he's not even hashing in the shadows right what is he doing?
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:35.020]   It pissed everybody off. It really did it. It caused a huge stir
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:40.220]   Uh, at least dramatically in this web comic sphere of things which was not very loud crowd
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.380]   Because it's good
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.380]   But that's my point is
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:49.980]   We nobody anymore can say what they youtube can't even say what they think youtube should be right
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:54.140]   You know people are gonna make it what they want which I love in the long run
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:58:01.100]   You know, I don't care. I'm old hat up dying soon anyway, so go ahead kids make your shopping hall videos. Enjoy yourself
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:06.940]   Have a good time. It's fine. We used to make real television, but not anymore
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:11.740]   You got to show off your makeup all okay go for it. I don't care
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:16.700]   Well, I want to be dead anyway, you know, then these sorts of things get they they they they they they go out there
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.660]   And then they get bought by somebody right so these things be popular too late already bought by soda
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:29.740]   No, I mean the shows right I mean, you know, do you well gobble up those popular? Well, what a revision three gets gobbled up by in a discovery
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.740]   Yeah, you get these
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.380]   Twit twit was just bought by AOL
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:40.140]   Oh god. Thank you. Thank you. It's not too late marissa. I love you darling

[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.060]   Here's a good will haul you doesn't have to be even the mall. It could be good will
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.340]   They went to good will good will hunting
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:54.460]   I like it
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:59:00.700]   So you start doing these the new twitch shopping channel there on youtube chat. I got a great idea
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:06.380]   We'll do fries haul. Oh, yeah, we'll go to fries. Here's what I am is on haul. I get I went to fries

[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.140]   No, this is better
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.140]   This is better. Look what I got on who
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:23.820]   Actually, we buy we brand new Samsung stores and best buy here's what I got
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:28.540]   I think fries is the one because it's not it's not every bnh
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:34.780]   Bnh is yeah, it could be multiple because she she had target. She had lush. She had and more
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.780]   You know, I got it. Well, that's because you can go to a mall

[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:15.100]   Four or five years earlier than the baby boomers, which would be an advantage all of our lives
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:21.180]   The war was the great mystery of those years. I knew we were at war against germany in japan
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.820]   I knew uncle bill had gone away to fight
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.820]   This this is a great time to read this book life itself a memoir now

[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:53.500]   I mean there's no better way to spend an hour at the gym and have it go by like that then listen to a great book

[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.700]   audible
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.700]   Dot com slash twit two
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:16.700]   And uh, we should mention uh, there is a new book that just came out. Neil game and is doing a whole series
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.980]   For audible where he finds a unique and unusual
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.100]   uh books and kind of uh, they record him
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.940]   In this case, this is a book that was written and kind of undiscovered
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:34.300]   I've written in the sixties called dimension of miracles and gamean who found it said this really reminds me of early douglas
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:40.860]   Adams this could have been hitchhiker's guy to the galaxy. So the robert sheckley wrote it. Uh, it's about a guy who kind of gets
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.420]   uh, well, uh
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:48.780]   He uh, he's traveling through the universe. He wins a contest
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.460]   um
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.540]   Uh, galactic lottery
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:57.180]   But the problem is that he's not eligible and he's and he's going to different time periods
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:03.500]   And it's just wild they got john hodgman to narrate it, which is wonderful. It had been a typically unsatisfactory day
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:10.940]   Perf harmony had gone to the office. Don't you want to listen to john hodgman read it. He's a hysterical science fiction comedy
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:16.060]   I mean you do so i would love i would listen to john hodgman read a phone book. I know i love him
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.140]   He makes everything funny
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.500]   Yeah, in fact in uh in one of his books. He almost does read the phone book. He reads a list of like 400 hobo names
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:30.300]   It's fantastic. It's hysterical. John jonathan colton behind him playing music. That way. It's awesome. Yeah, amazing
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.340]   I think that's areas of my expertise. I think i'm not sure it's one of the three
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:39.100]   Yep, uh, that's also an audible also a great also all three of them. Um
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:44.140]   See now here's the problem. This is the big problem with audible. You can't it's so hard to pick a couple of books
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:52.940]   Here we go. You got it. Yeah, hobo names number one stu builder Dennis number two
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.660]   cholly the egg
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.100]   number three
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.100]   hold in the expert dream cluster
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:03.900]   Number four the risk this is like a half hour. Uh, no
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:09.020]   No, there's 700 names. Yeah, it is an hour long
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.660]   55
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.340]   minutes and
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.300]   50 yours free 54 seconds. Yes
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.500]   56 minutes long
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.700]   So reading the phone book this is very much yeah
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:28.860]   Like that music, but I would wait I would I would park my car in the driveway and listen to all of these names
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.860]   Because it's john hodge is that why you have this is just on your audible account
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.900]   I love this hobo zero
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:44.620]   Okay, is that areas of my expertise? Is that the book that that one's on? I'm not sure which I forget first I forget
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.020]   Anyway, I think it's the first one. It's the first one
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.620]   Uh

[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.940]   You know, it's because I think we're in a weird
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.260]   Medicis this is a good topic for the show by the way
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.980]   But I think we're in this weird space now where like we just started watching house of cards last night
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.220]   Oh, yeah, I can spoil that for you big time

[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:22.540]   Everyone kind of just assumes you haven't seen it yet. Oh, by the way, have you started watching madmen?
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:27.980]   Have you started watching house of cards yet? So, um, I don't know. I don't think there is a statute anymore
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:33.260]   I think you gotta even a few years like if you haven't caught up after five years five years to me is the cutoff
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.740]   If you're not a lawyer or admin
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.620]   Right
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.460]   Now because now you've got okay. Have you seen house of cards yet?
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:42.860]   Right?
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.620]   No, because I've got four billion other series. I haven't caught up on yet
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:52.780]   And back in the day you had dallas and you had three other things that dallas competed with and probably back then two other things
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.860]   It competed with and so you only had the one thing to talk about the next day and now there's so much
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.820]   Just too much there's is tv better than ever
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.980]   I think it is. I I really do I really think tv is better
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:10.140]   It's amazing rattle off the names justified one of the best shows on television right season four just wrapped up fantastic
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:15.020]   I don't know that there's a better character than rail and givens anywhere on television. I haven't seen any of those
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:20.380]   That's great now. I can add that to my list. Listen clay and it's based on an award leonards
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.340]   Read and if you get a chance you can read them separate from it. You don't even need to read them at the same time
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:28.300]   There's another great audible books railin givens
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:33.580]   From elmore leonard me the character is based on an elmore leonard short story. I love elmore leonard
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:38.780]   So I know i'm oh my god. Yeah, and it's hilarious. He's a fallible, you know now
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.660]   Here's the tech here's the cord cutter problem though
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:46.140]   How do I find out where I could see that it's probably in various places right?
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:50.060]   I could probably buy it on iTunes maybe on amazon maybe vdo the new rdo
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:53.500]   Thing, but you don't know there's needs to be a way to search for that
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:59.340]   Right so that when we last year started using that app called can you stream
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:04.620]   Dot it can you stream dot it and it's an app for ios and android
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.660]   And yeah, you plug in what you're looking for and it'll show you on what services it's available
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.940]   You want to run amazon prime is it free on amazon prime?
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.420]   Oh, that's cool
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:19.100]   You know the other day I was about to buy some justice league unlimited episodes that I had already started investing in for my son
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.020]   And then someone tweeted me. I would have known about it otherwise and said hey by the way
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:28.060]   There's this just as league unlimited the original justice league series
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:33.100]   Batman brave and the bold are all now available streaming on netflix for free and I was gonna buy some of it
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.820]   That's also on the web can I can I stream dot it?
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.980]   Oh, it's great
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:42.380]   By the way justified is available at least the pilot for free
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.260]   on amazon prime
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:49.580]   And it's very rare that a show will suck me in on the very first episode and justified
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:55.740]   Pilot will do that to you just like the house of cars first episode will suck you in if you are not a fan of justified after the first
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.660]   Episode something you're not hooked up, right? Okay. I don't claim and I know this is right for real house
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:05.340]   Something's going on we were separated at birth or something. That is the best show on tv right now and it really
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:10.380]   If you're a fan of westerns, you're gonna get something you want out of the show if you're a fan of
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:14.780]   I don't know just good writing and dialogue like it isn't it isn't an insanely good
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.420]   television program and um
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.500]   Yeah, I echo everything you just said it's everyone should bought that show so good
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.140]   But even from there then you go to down to nabby, right?
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:30.380]   So everyone's talking about down nabby. So we finally started watching that about now. There's a big big spoiler on that one
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.020]   Oh sure. Yeah, it's really good too
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.980]   You know, I still haven't seen the crying game
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:42.380]   Because I it was spoiled for me. I don't want to see it because it was spoiled for me
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:49.900]   No, that's so how long ago was that that there is a statue to 92. Okay, so it's 21 years
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:56.940]   Yeah after 21 years. Okay, but but no sooner. Yeah, it was a bullet. There you go
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.900]   Yeah
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.900]   The Maltese falcon up it
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:07.820]   Maltese falcon is not really a bird. Okay. That's all I'm gonna say rose bud
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.940]   Citizen cane a slayer
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:14.620]   Oh, I just ruined a movie for you. Oh, the guys upset in the back
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.060]   For crying out loud
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:23.020]   But all this I mean what else down to nabby justified the wire
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.180]   I mean every every h hbo series, you know
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.420]   bathrooms
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.820]   TV has gotten much better. I don't understand it because I don't have enough time to watch all this crap
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:39.100]   Life has gotten life has gotten very very uh, there's a lot to do now
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.580]   If you're bored if you're bored in the 21st century, you're not paying attention
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:48.380]   Anytime there's a story about the way in which people are trying to cut capel
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:54.220]   They can't yet do it because they can't do x y and z or they this show is here. They're trying to get it here
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:16:00.940]   I'm fascinated by this because I think we're on the verge of a major major shift in the next few years and the way in which we consume content
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.180]   Uh, so to me very few topics are as interesting as the living room, right?
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.300]   It's the it's the hours you spend with your family at night watching television
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.340]   You gather around this particular place and I think it's a mess
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:15.100]   It's a muddled mess right now and I think we're on the verge
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:19.900]   We're we're on a tipping point. We're approaching that tipping point when how we're going to be able to consume all of this
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:26.380]   I know like people like to think that somehow the the apple tv is going to ride in on the white horse and save everyone
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.180]   I want the way in which we're going to be able to consume content
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:33.260]   I've given up on i've given up on on all of that. I you know
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:38.540]   By the way, this is another topic, but i'm starting to really think apple is uh is over
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:45.980]   It really is over. There's not there's no magical apple tv. There's nothing magical even an i watch it isn't magical. It's over
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:50.060]   Well, I think there's a difference between saying it's over and there's no apple tv
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:55.340]   Right. I I know I think I think that all the magic sauce is gone
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:17:03.100]   Well, we're in that cycle, right? It's gone apple always has the cycle. It's gone. Well, maybe it's only been gone when steve jobs isn't there but
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:09.660]   Well, I got bad news for you. He ain't coming back. I know it's it's not like a marvel hero. You can bring him back
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:14.220]   It's it is it is a little bit weird in this particular moment, but some would argue
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:20.380]   Everyone's at a transitional point right now. That's all about iteration. There is no innovation for a little bit until the next big thing
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.860]   Will they be the next big thing?
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.540]   If that is very good knows what that you know everyone people don't know right?
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.940]   It's this sort of argument that people don't know what they want until suddenly they're presented with it, right?
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.500]   People were writing off the iPad remember after the iPad event everyone was saying what really it's just a lot
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:41.660]   I'm coming from is it coming from apple from google from facebook or somebody we've never heard of like, you know, maybe this
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:48.060]   You know gesture thing. I mean the leep Packard Bell is not I can guarantee you
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:52.940]   The source it's nice to think that it comes from a startup, right?
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.140]   It's nice to think that that happens but apple very often, you know
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:01.660]   Takes technology a few years down the line once it's been tried out in the marketplace and gives it a shot
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:06.380]   But apple has all of these suppliers tied up, you know apple has these partnerships
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:12.140]   And so it's very difficult for some sort of startup to come in with a pebble watch and shake things up playing with the pebble watch last week
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.740]   I was
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.260]   Wohfully disappointed. Yeah, I could have told you that
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:22.300]   Yeah, I ordered one and still have a gut, but I could have told you that you knew it was yeah, it's
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:27.500]   Occasionally like the oculus rift is is the fine finally
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.700]   We have confirmation that VR can work and that it's cool
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:36.780]   And that we've got other technologies in place that have killed things like lag and other issues that we're gonna always have with these headsets
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.940]   And it's finally this viable affordable
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.100]   idea
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:46.300]   I think it comes in forms of things like that those are the things that come along and go oh the way we've been doing things
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.380]   Like tablets are good example
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.180]   That's going to change the way I compute or consume or whatever
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:57.900]   And I don't know who the next guy is but oculus rift is just a dude who got a lot of good backing and a big kickstarter success
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.540]   And but it doesn't change the fact that it came from a dude
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:04.140]   There's no reason Sony or a million other companies shouldn't have had that thing on the market first
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.540]   And they all have garbage for VR. Yeah
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:11.580]   No, I think the iPad was a revolution that smart the uh iphone was a revolution
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:16.620]   But I wouldn't expect anything at that revolutionary from apple again. Maybe google glass will be
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.420]   I think oculus rift is a very interesting
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.020]   Product from everything I've heard I haven't tried it. You guys have tried it obviously
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.540]   Well, I've never mind as we have a beatle man. I want one
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:33.820]   Yeah, so you've used it. I'm curious. How how was the were you dizzy? Did you get sick? Like what's the
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:39.740]   Well, my eyes are my eyes have been progressively getting worse, but I you know it was
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.220]   awe inspiring
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.900]   I mean, I just you it reminded me that you guys see the movie the surrogate's
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.620]   based on the great comic book
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.580]   Is the Bruce Willis movie
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:57.260]   Chad, so yeah, you basically sit in this like pod and you can be as obese and
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:03.500]   Slovenly as you want to be and you basically put on an oculus rift and you get to live the life that you should be living
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:09.660]   That's what I've been waiting for women. I'm going in the nursing home right at the same time as that technology comes out
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.700]   Right. It's like lucid dreaming
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:18.460]   I mean you can go out, you know and just live the life you want to live through the oculus rift and what's who's to say?
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.980]   What's reality and what's fake and you kind of feel like that you're like? Oh my god
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:28.140]   This is really what it's like and it's the same feeling our first had the first time I ever played like wolfenstein in 3d
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:35.420]   I'm going down a hallway. Yeah, well down a hallway and shooting Nazis. That was pretty amazing going down the hallway
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:39.820]   So but how much suspension of disbelief did you have to do with the oculus rift?
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:43.660]   Was it really that vivid or are you saying hey? It's pretty good because I think I'm wearing a helmet
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.180]   No, it is pretty vivid. It is really good and
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:51.340]   Yeah, it is and I wonder for you know, you don't get much time
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:56.300]   I wonder how much like a prolonged period of time would I start to feel like queasy and what I come out of it?
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.740]   You know because
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.820]   Was like seven years old you're not supposed to have kids go see 3d movies right like this right?
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.460]   I think this started when it's like seven years old and that's why the
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:07.980]   I can only play bio shocking infinite for 45 minutes before I vomit
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.540]   But it's such a good game that an hour later. I'm playing it again
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:17.100]   Yeah, it is true when you play call of duty or names games where it's immersive
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.740]   Yeah in front of a big screen you get a little woozy
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:26.140]   They're recommending so there's two there's two things to play at play here. They're recommending you don't play for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:28.940]   What that's that's what they're saying at first till you get used to it
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.060]   Because it will cause kind of some of this disorientation
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:36.780]   But the other problem is there are ways to play it where the head tracking is your movement depends on the game, right?
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:41.900]   But there are other games where the mouse or the controller are what are controlling your left or right or your up or down
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:48.220]   And when you're moving on those axes with the controller yet, you're so immersed and it isn't your head that's doing it
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.580]   They're having people get like violently ill from that
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:56.300]   That experience hey and you know, you're in a helmet. So when you
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.020]   when you hear all
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:03.580]   Well, it's just eyes so you could be very realistic. Yeah, so I'm a backer
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.460]   I I don't know when do we get when do we backers get ours? I don't know
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:11.340]   All of the you should be getting actually depends on when you got in but you should be getting them pretty quick most of the
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.020]   Dev kit versions of this which really it is a dev kit at this point
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:20.860]   But it is shipping to early backers and people have already gotten them so it's so excited next few weeks
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:24.140]   Yeah, well, I'll be wearing it for the next to it for sure
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:27.580]   Barzan all of your deaths
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:34.140]   So you could you could mentally be on a beach, but still doing a show. I'm already doing that
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:41.180]   I wouldn't be the different. Oh, I'm already doing that. I got sand up my butt right now
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:46.220]   So so no, that's I'm excited and you're right. I think I think innovation
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:52.300]   Uh comes in unpredictable ways and and and often the best innovations are complete paradigm shifts
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:57.340]   They're discontinuities that are unpredictable and I think they rarely come from big companies
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:04.460]   Yeah, I don't know. I was saying I was making my Beatles analogy because I there's we want that sort of
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.260]   The guy that we're counting out to come back right?
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:11.980]   Beatles have their they're never reunited. They never did they're big american
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:17.980]   They're big american triumph right and then they kind of then they kind of fizzled a little bit and then they came back with a rubber
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.700]   Soul and those in those songs, you know top 10
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:26.060]   You know number one hits number one hits and then everyone ran them off the thought the Beatles are done and the press was writing about
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.420]   They're all done. They're gone. They're gone, but they were all the the entire time
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:33.980]   They were in the studio recording sergeant peppers and everyone's like beetles are done. They're not touring anymore
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.740]   They stopped touring they're gone. They're gone. They're gone
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:39.020]   And then suddenly they really sergeant peppers everyone's like holy crap
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:40.300]   Why is this?
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:45.660]   Paul and Ringo Paul and Ringo ever just grab a donut or something just hang out. They got together for something
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.420]   They played together for something
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:50.460]   Uh, well, you know, I saw him at the it was at the microsoft
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:55.100]   What was it the connect launch at e3?
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:58.620]   That's all the Ringo walk out on the stage
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:05.420]   No wonder security was locked down totally. Yeah, Paul and Ringo walk down. They wait at a hello
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:12.780]   And remember that you know the Beatles was it good to a rock band or um, they launched it there. Yeah, we're probably rock band. Yeah. Yeah
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:19.340]   Huh rock band Beatles. I remember that. Yeah, that's another example of the connect by the way is another example of
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:24.700]   Of innovation or could have been truly innovative. It just wasn't there. Right
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:27.500]   Well, I think Oculus Rift
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.540]   So this is something that we've been wearing these VR helmets for 20 years
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.940]   But now that the technology's finally caught up they actually can do something
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.660]   Yeah, you have one-to-one movement and you've got you know
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:44.380]   All the stuff that we've been doing with our phones with with motion and 360 degree motion and stuff those have all contributed to this
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:49.660]   So it is in a way. It's iterative, but it's also kind of innovative and those sorts of things really excite me
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.220]   They usually they're usually usually around gaming
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.620]   It's usually where these big innovations seem to pop for me
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:59.180]   The big question is will the Oculus Rift become a standard display type for a lot of things that we do
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.740]   That's really an untold story yet
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.740]   And usually it's the porn industry that has to determine that anyway, so let's see how that goes
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.260]   Wow, that'll be interesting. Oh, will it though? Yeah
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:14.220]   I don't know. I mean you see the line at CES for the Oculus Rift. I mean it was
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.580]   What is one woman two women in the eye? It's one of them said no
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.180]   Boys blue ray eyes are here. Yes
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.620]   Why did they go away? My eyes are up here
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:30.860]   All right, the Oculus Rift no one would know no one knows you keep looking them
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.180]   We're gonna take a break
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:39.180]   Clayton Morris is here from Fox and Friends and from frog pants.com Scott Johnson
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:44.620]   I apologize for those of you who tuned in for Tim Stevens. We just really couldn't keep him online
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:50.060]   I guess the windstorm was affecting his bandwidth. So we'll get Tim back from Engadget another time
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:54.220]   I'm gonna play the trailer in a moment for funnier dies Steve Jobs movie
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.460]   That'll be fun
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.380]   And we'll talk about the iPhone 5
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.380]   I mean if you think Apple's still innovative
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.420]   My question for you. I'll give you guys some time to think about it
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:07.180]   What could the iPhone 5s have that would suddenly change
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:10.140]   everything
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:10.860]   Let's talk about it

[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.500]   Yeah, I actually canceled my order for the pixel
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:24.700]   You did yeah, I got a review unit you have one it sounds like yeah. Yeah, I got a review unit and um, it's too expensive
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.580]   for a browser
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.820]   Oh, it's ridiculous. I mean
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:34.060]   I was having a discussion with our mutual friend rene richy and
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:39.900]   He was saying, you know, this is i'm not the target audience for this who is no no you are the target
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:44.620]   Oh, yes for this, but it's a mistake that you're the target audience for this
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:47.900]   Right because he does, you know, he's like I want to be doing photoshop
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:51.820]   He's like so i'm not the target audience for this, but he is precisely the target audience for this
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.700]   And so am I I need to be you know doing photoshop
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:58.140]   So i'm gonna spend $1,300 for a laptop with a beautiful screen
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:04.540]   I want to be able to do some things with it. Um, and uh, you know, that's why i buy a macbook pro with a retina display
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:10.140]   So you can actually do photoshop you actually do light room you can actually do aperture and you can actually do some things with it
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.780]   You're right. It's way too expensive
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:17.340]   for uh, it's pretty have all these hacks and workarounds for things
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:22.380]   They're just like just normal just commonplace things that you you come to rely on is absurd. Yeah
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:27.020]   Yeah, all right. I'm glad thank you because everybody everybody's just saying oh you should you should what are you?
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:31.900]   What are you crazy? This is the beautiful screen. It's first of all. It's weird. It's three two, which is bizarre
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:37.900]   Um, we don't we don't want that we want to 16 by 9 screen. Thank you very much. I like touch
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:43.260]   I'm a big fan of touch on the screens. It's okay. It's retina. I like that if mac if apple did a
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:46.620]   MacBook pro retinow with touch i'd be super happy
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:52.060]   Um, but this is just it's it's crumb. Oh, s. I don't understand who that's designed that
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:57.420]   Is it it does have a beautiful keyboard? I will say that it's pretty board is fantastic nice piece of metal
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:00.220]   Yeah
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:05.100]   What what could apple do in the five s that would make you sit up and take notes?
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.900]   Look they're they're now going up against the galaxy s4
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:13.580]   1920 by 1080p and a 4.7 inch display quad core processors
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:20.460]   All sorts of capabilities that the iphone just can't do even serie which made they made a lot of hay with with a 4 s
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:23.420]   Is outpaced outgunned by google voice?
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:29.660]   Um, what could they do in the five s software? It's gotta be software right? Yeah, so what?
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:32.780]   A map where i'm working works
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.620]   Well, I mean like I mean I think you hit I hit you hit one of the nails in the head which is
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:40.940]   Uh, well google and google voice search in google now. I mean it's
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:45.500]   Blazing fast how how amazing google voice search is on ios
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:50.380]   Um, and then I have to wait and sometimes, you know, not get any sort of responses
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:56.140]   I'm getting little purple dots that appear when I you know, I've just transcribed an entire paragraph of an email
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:58.060]   Oh, so frustrating
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:02.060]   And it disappears. I thought god, why don't I just I spent now i'm wasting more time
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.700]   By hoping that it would have responded to me
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:09.900]   And typing when it works it works great. I mean it dictates stuff all the time and it works great
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:14.380]   However, it's just that when it doesn't truly frustrate but google voice search
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.340]   I mean just how quickly you can launch here. I have the s3
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.820]   Uh
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:23.820]   And see no man turn the volume next to the ocean. I need a pizza
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:27.260]   Who doesn't by the way
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.780]   And boom, you know all sorts of results pop up. Yeah, I need a pizza
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:36.540]   It's so much faster. It's so much faster than syruy. I mean so software based I think I mean that's
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:40.460]   But that's where a lot of the iterations have come from from apple in the past
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:48.300]   Is software yes, they're gonna update the camera. They're gonna make the processor faster and the and and the overall sleekness of the device is going to be there
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:55.580]   Um in my opinion apple's problem is they set a pace for iteration of one year per phone
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:33:00.860]   That at the time was great and it made consumers reassured the phone's not going to progress too fast
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:04.140]   Apple even made hay saying look at all the different, you know
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:11.340]   Fragmentation in the in the android market, but but what happened is they got way behind and now they cannot iterate fast enough
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.220]   And and sam stung is iterating every few months
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:20.460]   Scott are you an iphone user? I am um the bump moving ives over to
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:24.940]   Essentially, you know kind of take over the reins of iOS and and all of that front end stuff
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.300]   I think is probably a good move for them
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:32.060]   But it also speaks to what you just said they're behind and they're behind because of this they're a particular schedule for iteration
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:36.220]   Some people think iphones come out too fast. I would argue that it's a combination
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:41.900]   They're coming out too fast and part of the reason they're coming out too fast is because they're just making small incremental changes
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:47.660]   What they ought to do is give us a year between them and really go crazy and old stockholders won't love that and everything else
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.740]   But it'd be really great to see them say no
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:54.220]   We've gone to the the wire here on the six or whatever the next one is five s like you say
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.780]   What do we expect for five s? I expect hardly anything nothing
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:02.780]   Nothing really is nothing to expect and if there's one thing we've learned from blackberry and windows phone is you snooze
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:08.140]   You lose in the smartphone business. It's like this. Yeah, it's really fast. I think that they're gonna see the ground though
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.900]   I mean, I think something interesting is coming from past book
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:15.420]   I know it's not no it's not
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.460]   I can guarantee you they don't have
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:23.740]   Well, I don't know that nfc's the way to go. I don't even have a wallet in there
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.180]   Last year I was surprised we didn't see more with low-powered bluetooth
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.740]   And I know that apple is all in on low-powered bluetooth
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:33.420]   And I would be really surprised if apple puts nfc in the next iphone
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:38.620]   I think they are all in with low-powered bluetooth. I think they think they see this as the future technology
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:45.900]   And but my my fear was how are you going to get businesses small businesses that struggle as it is
[01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:48.140]   the little coffee shop
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:55.900]   The little the little the little bakery down the street to start getting some sort of other device that they need to then pay for
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:59.340]   And have on their counter where they're gonna have to pay a percentage of it. They're not going to do it
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:02.780]   So low-powered bluetooth perhaps is the best way to do that
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.980]   And integrate with the things that already exist
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:12.940]   So I think apple whether or not and these rumors are true about having to pull the past book team and shake things up as we've been hearing
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.660]   They've not been happy with the results so far
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:20.380]   And I think it's been frustrating and I know that apple pr has been trying to do some things to get the word out of a past book
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.860]   Certainly see it with mlb
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:26.060]   They're trying to sort of front and center with a pr behind the mlb
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:29.100]   Have you used it for tickets or for playing tickets or anything like that?
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:32.860]   I love it. I use it for tickets and I get frustrated. Here's the problem though
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.540]   I never know
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:38.780]   What airline is using it or when I go to that particular small airport
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:43.500]   Oh, the reason that I can use it in san francisco at this united terminal
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:49.100]   But I can't use it in noxville is because this noxville terminal is an outfit with the scanner
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:54.700]   That's not an apple in apple. No, no, but you right but there's you just you remember when you first launched past book
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:36:00.540]   You you couldn't figure out how you were supposed to get passes into it. Right you didn't realize you have to
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.140]   Exact
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:07.980]   Right you they did a terrible job of explaining apple did a terrible job of explaining that you had to download the starbucks apple
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:11.260]   Also, yeah, and then I like force it to send it to past point
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.140]   I like what engi card in the chat room says it says it's sad
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:19.900]   But apple feels like the vulvo of smartphones these days the safe choice and I think there's quite a bit to that
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.500]   It's the thing I know when I get it
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.540]   I'm going to have all my apps work and any new apps are going to work
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:29.660]   And I'm not going to have the fragmentation the android devices enjoy or hate whichever however you stand on it
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.220]   Um, but I but it's getting to the point where
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:38.460]   Safe is not exciting and when it's when you're not doing something exciting you start to lose market share and that's what's happening now
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.860]   So I think they need to shake things up with something
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:45.500]   Radically, but maybe that means opening the phone more. I don't know what it means
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.020]   But I'm not complaining about the hardware freaking love it. I wish ios
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.020]   But i think i'm sure
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:56.380]   Because we've seen a number of reports that over in at least the quarter in the holiday quarter
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.140]   Uh apple has gained on samsung in the heart
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.060]   Understand we're not okay when we talk now the you know
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.940]   what we're talking about is
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:13.100]   Warning signs that won't really show up in market share until it's too late to do anything about it
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.900]   Be you know what I mean? I mean they're doing just fine. They're making lots of men people in the chamois
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:21.180]   Well, they're making lots of money. They're number one. What's wrong with them? That's fine
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:25.980]   But in this business you got to stay ahead because what happens if you lose mind share you lost it
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:29.660]   And so I think that they really have trouble with this 5s
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:33.740]   I think what's going to happen with a 5s is there's not much they can do given
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:40.220]   They're the way they work to make it uh stand out in the way they have in the past with the i4
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:47.020]   Was a revelation right but do they have to do what stamson did which is shove a whole bunch of crap in there
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.500]   Right. I'm not sure stamson just got the yeah
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:55.660]   You know, we'll see what's that s4. Well the announcement was so hard that it's hard to tell right the announcement was horrid
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:00.780]   But yes the the forget the announcement because most people didn't pay attention to it right just in the tech press
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:04.700]   Get a lot of right you had a lot of techies jumping online to watch the live stream
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:08.700]   But when you had the new york post front cover the next day saying i phone
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:15.180]   E we and a foot and that's the first time i've ever seen a non apple product on the front page of the new york post
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:19.100]   Uh samson galaxy s4 that you can control with your eyes
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:24.460]   Um, but these are all gimmicky things. Oh, it gives it. I mean really does anyone care that that
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:29.500]   You know the samson galaxy s4 can be partially controlled with your eyes that when I glance away from a video
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:33.820]   It's gonna stop there was a moment it looks like it makes it look like people are going after stuff
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.380]   And it makes it seem like samson's way ahead of this curve even though that curve may be filled with dumb
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:42.700]   Gimmicks that we don't care about ultimately or never use more than once but they've got that
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:49.420]   Weird energy behind it that apple had in 2007 2008 you felt it you could feel this palpable like oh man
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:54.380]   Liquid they have changed phones and they did they changed it now. They're just kind of doing the safe
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.940]   I like the volvo comparison still it's a good
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:59.820]   That is good count on yeah, all right as long as they're not a sob
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:02.540]   Right, um man
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:07.500]   There was a good review of the htc1 in a non tech but one of the most thorough reviews ever read bran cluke published
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.340]   Oh my god, it's amazing
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   But he makes a really important point which is
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:17.100]   Some of these but seem to me gimmicky features are really about having a story you could tell in marketing
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.860]   It's very hard to tell a story about a phone
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:24.380]   So it may be just one feature that you realize this is the story and he says in this case
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.780]   that these uh what they call them zoes
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.180]   um that they have
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:33.820]   They they automatically makes kind of these uh shareable movies plus still
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:38.620]   Things uh when you take pictures with the htc1 he said this
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:43.500]   You may think this is a gimmicky thing, but this is the kind of thing you can build an ad campaign around
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:49.340]   And that may be more important than whether it's uh really valuable or whether you even use it once you get the phone
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:53.020]   Well, it's like seery right it didn't war it was in beta
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.020]   But it's a great ad yeah
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:59.980]   Certainly a great ad yeah and everyone refers to not everyone but a lot of people refer to voice
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:07.580]   Voice technology and talking to your phone is seery right whether or not you're actually using google google search or not
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.740]   Right you're kind of talking to seery
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:13.260]   Uh even casual people refer to it as seery now
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:19.740]   Uh, so it was a smart move and you're absolutely right and in non tech is absolutely right about that being able to tell a narrative around particular
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:24.140]   Uh feature if as long as it's not gimmicky though, that's the problem and I think it is
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:28.300]   I don't know um seery was okay
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.740]   I think it can't really when you start when you get down to it if it had worked, maybe it wouldn't have been gimmicky
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:34.860]   Well, that's why I don't know that's why it's like it's like the connect to me
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:39.020]   If that thing would have worked way better out of the gate right it would have had our mind share
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:42.860]   We would have we wouldn't be talking about how much you know google voice works better and all this sort of stuff
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:46.620]   And the fact that we're using google apps on our iphones that outpace
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:52.140]   That do the same sort of functionality without the system level stuff and outpace seery at its own job is
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:56.380]   Embarrassing to them. Yes must be walking around with a funny hat on going damn it
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:57.500]   What are we doing?
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.020]   You know google now when you get to the airport it says oh he's at the airport
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.980]   Let me show his his boarding pass which I got from his gmail
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:08.140]   Uh, so it's it does it kind of without you're even thinking about it
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:12.140]   I was blown away. We went to spring training a couple of times here
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.460]   I go go see the giants in in in Phoenix for my wife
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:24.140]   But I was shocked to start, you know using google now was a bit of a revelation. I rarely you know we covered the stuff where we're rarely
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.820]   um
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:32.540]   surprised by this kind of stuff right um and google now just stunned me because we were going to phoenix
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.820]   And I didn't I forgot that it was in my calendar
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.100]   And I forgot I didn't know which airline we were taking
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.940]   A lot of this information I just forgotten didn't plan on it had put a card up there with the weather for phoenix
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.660]   Nicely tucked underneath my new york car
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:51.420]   Just showed me the current weather and there was phoenix popping up behind it to show me that
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:55.980]   Oh, here's the weather. Yeah, then it has the the airline pass right up there for south west airlines right there
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.980]   You didn't do anything
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:59.420]   I didn't do anything
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.900]   And it was great. Yeah, and now somebody say this creepy
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.700]   Uh, I like it
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:09.420]   Here, let's watch the two from funny or die remember there's three steve jobs movies
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:15.260]   There's the ashton kutcher jobs which premiered at the sundance film festival in january and then mysteriously disappeared
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:20.700]   We if you saw that clip you might know why it was bizarre and had nothing to do with fact
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:27.020]   We're waiting for erin sorkin's film for sony based on the isex and biography, but who knew funny or die
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:30.780]   Made a steve jobs movie. Here's the first trailer
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:36.060]   From it funny. I gotta play it off the funny and die site. Let me go here. We go
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:44.460]   I wouldn't even know where to start. We if the man made computers simple the entire world will listen to
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:51.740]   They say you're a renegade a rebel one of a kind a maverick a bed of a loose cannon and the establishment a free thinker genius of sword engineer
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.740]   Crafts a bad poet and a prophet
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:58.940]   I just think it was the correct vision of my fan the first micro computing system
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:03.020]   Can you imagine the possibilities of us the computing revolution at your fingertips? Why?
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.580]   Why do you have it?
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.420]   I
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:12.540]   Genius left unchecked can lead to ruin in life. You just you gotta stay foolish
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:17.900]   You gotta just stay hungry keep taking risks call the ipod or a case i of a piece p lowercase l or a case t
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:22.300]   Right there. I gotta ride the way for the future. What if I am the way for future go find yourself
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.300]   You get back
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:26.300]   I'm gonna be right here
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:30.540]   The future belongs to the outcast faster rebels, but you are needed
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:34.620]   Nothing matters to steve jobs except steve jobs
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:38.700]   Less to eat the forbidden fruit and face
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.940]   Banish
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:52.460]   Justin long is i steve
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.220]   Coming soon to a web browser dear you
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:44:04.540]   I can't wait. This might be the best one april 15 obviously parody, but it's it's kind of an odd feeling of like that's how
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:07.420]   They would do it actually real right now
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:11.980]   We felt better than the original trailer we saw with kutcher in much better
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.420]   And the guy I don't know if they got was but he sure sounds like was
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:22.140]   I think the best the best stroke is that they got jason long who plays the mac on i'm a mac i'm a pc to play steve jobs
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:26.380]   Right even though he looks nothing like ashton kutcher, which I thought was an advantage
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:30.220]   It's brilliant that
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.220]   Yeah, does he that would be good
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:40.140]   They do these sort of viral they they know that doing like an apple parody video like konan has been smart about this
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:46.300]   Right he does a lot of these sort of apple parody videos around new apple announcements and they take off like gangbusters
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:48.540]   And you're like oh, that's right konan still has a show
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:59.020]   We play on here every time right I mean this they pop up on hulu plus you see them like this apple parody video that konan
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:02.780]   Oh konan still has a show you know and and they work
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.300]   It's brilliant. What is that what is the fox must have a late night
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:12.780]   Do they I don't know I don't think so no there was rumors that they were going to try to get uh
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:14.700]   TBS s konan
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:17.740]   Jimmy kimels beating leno so that so they're gonna fire leno
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.020]   Yeah, and put jimmy phallon in there that's official now
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.260]   Nobody would have predicted
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.820]   Kimmell was gonna win that fight that is the
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:30.540]   Whimble of all people Kimmell's great. I love watching it
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:34.540]   But it's just such a strange term events everyone just counted that show outs and good luck
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:37.420]   You'll be here for 10 minutes. You know who I love is great Ferguson
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:40.860]   Yeah, that's a funny show that's a stereo letterman victim
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:45.420]   I I love I'm in the reason I got it in television was because of david letterman my idol. I know
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:48.620]   You know the
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:50.620]   Sick like 65 now
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:52.780]   I think he's even older than that. He's older
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:55.580]   60s I think
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.660]   Yeah, I used to I used to worship him. I
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:02.220]   Tenest with suits for a long time like back in when I was in high school and he was doing the day
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:05.820]   Night he used to wear those tennis shoes for wrestling shoes. I was a freak about letterman
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:10.220]   I used to put a tape recorder up next to the tv speaker
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:15.100]   Uh just a regular old, you know tape like a set tape and I would record entire episodes
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:19.100]   Of late night with david letterman and take him to school with me and listen to them covertly with my hand
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:20.380]   It's awesome
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:25.660]   I used to tape on vhs and then watch them. I had like season after season of letterman
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:30.460]   I used to buy just stacks of vhs tapes of letterman shows and just record them and just I
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:35.580]   You know I think from like 92 93 94. I have like every episode of the late show
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:40.460]   Yeah, brilliant letterman call my house one time and it
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:43.020]   Called our house
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.980]   Yeah, because I had written him and I wanted advice in broadcasting
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:50.700]   You know, I know how much of an affinity he has for broadcasting. So I was in high school getting ready to go off to college
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.780]   And I just was seeking his advice
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:58.780]   About broadcasting as it related getting into late night, you know in the television and so forth and and uh that it was
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:03.340]   I knew his history so well and so it was a very like heartfelt letter that I wrote to him
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:06.380]   and uh called my house and left a voicemail or a
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:09.340]   answering machine tape message at my parents house
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:13.180]   Uh, and I wasn't going to receive that one. I hope you saved that
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:16.780]   I have it somewhere. Yeah. Oh, like get it out. We gotta hear it
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:20.700]   Not now. I mean, you know next time you're on find that I want to hear it
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:26.220]   I want to die out. I'll have to dig for it. We have letterman. I have something to come and we both become angry bitter old men
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.780]   So I have I have that
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:31.020]   going with him
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:37.260]   You know, he influenced every everyone and except maybe leno and in the in his generator me phallin and kimmel are obviously
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.180]   Hugely influenced by letterman
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.100]   Well, you asked about fox and I was just gonna say and I don't know if there's any truth to it and god
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.100]   Hope we got help us if it's true
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:49.740]   Which are because i'm not a leno fan at all, but there were some rumors. Oh, he would leave nbc and then he might go to fox
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:52.220]   I know
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:56.540]   He's done it before though. Remember he he said konnen take the show and then he came back
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:59.100]   I'll take it back. He's like
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.980]   Right, right. It take it and uh, i'm gonna pull it back. We pulled pull the rug out from under you. Yeah
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:08.140]   Oh, he'll be back somewhere. Yeah, no, no, no, never would never die that chin
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:12.300]   Uh, i'm sorry. That's not that's mean
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.940]   Now i told you i'm an angry bitter old man
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:21.020]   You're a chinnest is what you are you're a chinnest. I am. That's right. I'm very i'm biased against the chin
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:25.100]   Right sam sangh is doing stores. You mentioned this inside best buy
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:30.460]   Everybody's so influenced by apples success at retail that everybody's just copying them
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:37.500]   But i think sangh is doing something interesting with these stores that apple doesn't do it best buy and i think there is something to be said
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.900]   If you ever walk into a best buy god help you if you do
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:44.620]   Um when you go into a best buy you'll notice that it's like kind of a bit of like a ghost town
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:48.540]   Right if you need help, you'll just see a tumbleweed roll. Oh, it's true
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:55.020]   And a cowboy cowboy will come up buy in, you know, you know what you're gonna get and um
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:58.860]   But you go over to that apple section and it is a beautiful section, right?
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.660]   It's got that like you know, it looks like a little mini apple store
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:07.660]   It's got the hardwood tables and it's well lit and then you look at like the asus tablets laying there on the table and they look like
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:12.220]   I don't looks like a dead carp on a on a beach right? I mean it just looks like sad
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:18.380]   And it's got that chain it's got that cable attached glue to the back like somebody's gonna steal this
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:25.820]   Right, right like really the one that for all of the apple products are turned on and the screens are on and like you look over at that
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:30.860]   At their sad lonely table with like the matter we did hapless and are all dead and know what you can't even turn
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:33.180]   You don't even know what a power button is on half that crap
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:39.580]   But sam's song though is doing something smart. They're gonna have their own sam's song representatives and a help desk there
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:44.140]   And this is smart because very often if you're asking for help on some of the apple products
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:48.460]   You get some best buy guy who's used to dealing with windows eight pcs and doesn't know
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.660]   You know doesn't know any of the apple products and how to help you with them
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.220]   um, so to have a sam's song sort of
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:50:00.540]   Help desk representative standing there to help you along to make your sam's song purchase. I think is a smart move
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:05.260]   Good idea about the weird logistics of that like those guys all have to share the same break room
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:09.580]   Do you think it's gonna be a lot of animosity between 60 year old kids and blue shirts and like I
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:15.660]   Did that though apple did that at uh was it best buy apple remember they had the apple apple stores inside there
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.540]   And an apple rep wasn't it yeah, it was compu estate
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:21.100]   Yeah, there was a guy there standing there
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:25.820]   Well best buy has an apple rep at the moment too. They had to it was self-defense right
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:30.700]   Oh, I I never see it like that my point is I never see that apple rep
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:36.300]   Apparently this must be a help desk right by the sam's son tables and they're gonna be larger like 460 square feet
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:39.340]   Of these stores you're gonna see a sam's song representative standing there
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:42.300]   Right, so you know say have more of a presence
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:47.100]   You know you like to kind of gravitate towards the sales guy who's kind of standing there. Yeah, yeah
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:50.300]   Maybe you'll do a shopping haul
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:51.980]   Right
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:53.980]   See if we got at the sam's son's store
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.500]   Yeah
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:00.140]   uh mobile phone celebrating its 40th anniversary this week 40 years
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.620]   Oh, man
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:04.380]   Really the Motorola no
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.380]   Yeah, I think so wasn't it that big
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:10.220]   The the thing and they had to have a get a get a like a purse that had the battery in it
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:15.500]   Did you ever see here's a little nerd trivia you ever see that x files episode that was like a flashback episode
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:21.340]   Um of the x files where fox moulder like because you know he was famous for always having a cell phone
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:28.380]   Right he was one of the first television characters. It was like ubiquitous with the cell phone right he and he and dana scully always had the cell phone
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:34.780]   Right. Well, they did like a flashback episode where he had one of these large giant honk and motor roll of phones with him
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:40.380]   It was like michael douglas in wall street that that nothing about that movie makes it so dated
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:44.220]   As the as the cell phone it just he's like wow eighties
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:49.820]   Those giant car phones used to use and i've been watching the west wing on netflix all the way through again and i
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:55.580]   Freakin love why i love anything sorcan does but i love the west wing and it is funny to watch season one through four
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:57.660]   Which is where i'm at so far in the process
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:00.700]   The phones went from these giant bricks or just pagers
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:06.940]   And then slowly the pagers and the bricks went away and slowly you got down to like flip phones and star attacks and
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:11.980]   Actually the first the pilot of west wing is is all about a cell phone is his pager
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:14.540]   Oh, it's about the pager
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.540]   Right. Otis is in a tree accident
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:20.940]   So uh, tiffins is calling i just wanted to check and see how his cell phone reception
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:24.380]   Is doing there in upper new york state what tim
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:26.940]   Yeah
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.940]   Did you get that from the battlefield of vietnam?
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:31.580]   Yeah, i should crank it
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.380]   Colonel paly just

[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.900]   I probably can't also when I was when I was a political reporter in montana
[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:56.620]   Yeah, I remember having the cell phone that was you know given to me by cbs news at the time and
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:02.220]   That that you know that cell phone was you know, you would it would the battery would last like 15. Oh, yes
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.500]   Oh, yeah
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:09.740]   You would never use it unless you were in some kind of a car accident you wouldn't use it for work purposes for emergencies albite
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:12.300]   Get off of the car

[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:20.940]   A day today today
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:30.860]   Twitter gets a vine copyright complaint from prince's record label. That's just in prince is still at it still at it
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:36.860]   I'm dealing with vine and you guys I stop. You like it. Are you making lots of vines?
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:42.060]   Fair amount. I mean probably two maybe a week, but you know, I'm not will sasso or something
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:46.860]   But I it is a you know what's happening on there is every comment for ed has it has
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:52.220]   Devolved I was gonna say evolved but is devolved into kind of a ha ha very funny follow me
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.380]   Oh boy, that's too bad
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:57.420]   Just begging for follows and I don't dig that so much
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.700]   But I like what my friends are doing and it's fun to keep tracking people that way and stuff
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:03.980]   I like it. Prices are dropping for windows rt tablets
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:11.500]   Might be a time to snag one or to walk away. Just step away from the rt tablet
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:15.500]   Yeah, the irony is I think this is where microsoft is going with windows 8
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:19.180]   I think rt is closer to what they want in windows 8 to be than windows 8 pro is
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:21.980]   They want to go touch
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:25.180]   Did you see the picture of bill gates and paul allen at the computer museum?
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:26.380]   Yes
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:33.820]   Recreating their famous picture from the earliest days of microsoft was from 1981 a baby faced bill gates
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:37.180]   Who I think is 26 in this image. He looks like he's 15
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:40.860]   And paul allen and these were late model
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:46.620]   Commodore pets and apple twos and late model computers at the living computer museum
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:50.540]   They got bill and paul back together with the same computers. This is kind of cute
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:53.660]   And there they are
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.660]   I think that's sweet
[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:58.140]   Gates whoa, he still weighs 130 pounds
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:05.180]   Same haircut. Yeah, he hasn't actually the haircut's the same. Isn't it? Yeah, paul at least shaved the beard
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:08.540]   I don't I like that there's something about that. It's just
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:13.180]   It's because I'm a grumpy old man and now they are too, right? Yep
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:16.140]   I don't get known
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:19.500]   Just need to cure malaria and you can yeah, well, you know good for him. I mean
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.420]   It's hard. It's hard to say anything bad about bill gates now
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:29.100]   Because it's impossible for me. I think that man's amazing. He's become the great philanthropist. Yep. Yep
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.940]   Goodness
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:32.140]   He's kind of trail
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:36.780]   He's he's blazed this trail. I think for a lot of tech folk and a lot of startups that made millions
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:40.220]   You know if when people are all done making their spaceships and their car companies
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.540]   It'd be nice to see him do a little bit of this you gotta get back
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.940]   I wonder what
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.660]   Fox thinks about this the area legal victory
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:55.020]   Barry Diller created this company area, which kind of it seems like an interim company. The idea was you could get local television
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:58:00.380]   Um because you bought a dime sized antenna in an array of dyes sized antennas
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:04.940]   That would then connect to the internet and you could watch tv via this antenna
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:11.660]   Of course local stations that didn't get any money for this said hey wait a minute. That's copyright violation. Well now the courts
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:16.060]   Have uh have uh said no, it's not cbs
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:19.500]   Comcast news corp pbs walt disney company
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:23.820]   You're out of luck area is legal
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:26.620]   Which means now that um
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:30.780]   Uh, I think we're gonna see area all over the country
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:36.300]   It's a yeah, it's a weird technology, but it but i've used it. Have you you must have used it Clayton because you're in the new york here
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.500]   It works
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.740]   Yeah, and it works very very well. It's so cool
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.940]   And it's um remarkable how well it works
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:48.700]   You you know, you can even use the web apps you can launch mobile safari on your ipad navigate right to the app
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:53.260]   And you know in the new york area, of course you can get access to I think 20 different channels
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:59.740]   Um, so you get some weird like pakistani channel you get some weird tylenese channel you get some all you got all kinds of weird
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:02.300]   It's all the over the air stuff right
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.460]   Yeah, but then you get great live sports
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:08.380]   Of course you get all the broadcast channels pbs high definition. It looks beautiful
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:12.460]   And you can leave town you can you can come here and you could still watch your new york sports
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:17.660]   Right and so here's the deal like i'm up at tinky wiggy and i can just uh
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:21.420]   I can just I can just stream it over airplay
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:29.420]   Right to an apple tv at a different location. I could come over to your house and petaluma and I could stream the new york stuff based on my subscription
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:35.500]   To on airplay and it looks crystal clear so you can watch local news you can travel with it and go wherever you go
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:39.180]   Yes, you can watch it on the app that's coming you can watch it on the web
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:44.860]   And you could watch it on your tv and there's no restriction as far as airplay goes it's yours you're paying 12 bucks a month
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:49.100]   And of course the argument was that why is this any different
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:54.620]   Than the antenna that I could put on my roof. Of course the broadcast companies were saying well wait a second
[01:59:54.620 --> 02:00:04.700]   We're creating this content now this look now this intermediary company is coming along and they're going to make money off of our content by selling you a 12 dollar
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:11.340]   subscription so I don't think it'll be very long until cbs has a little den of antennas set up in brook one somewhere
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:15.100]   Right why wouldn't they well why wouldn't they charge 12 bucks?
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:20.060]   Right why wouldn't bs 2 in new york city decide to set up their own version of this or
[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:24.860]   Maybe s cbs corporate decides to you know to do the same thing
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:29.340]   Um, I don't know anything with apps. It's like well. We don't want to have our shows on
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:32.140]   We're gonna make our own app. It's the same reaction
[02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.620]   Um and as a good name for this kind of stuff's great
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:41.100]   Yeah, it was so it's cbs cbs was the holdout right they they created that what tv.com right?
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:46.540]   There's our bridge and then they finally came around and just about in january they finally came to hulu
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:49.740]   So you can now watch the letterman on hulu you could watch star trek now on hulu
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:51.820]   They were the last holdout to join hulu
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:59.180]   It's so smart that berry dealer thought you know if everybody has an antenna that it's not a cable service
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:03.900]   It's one per person and you're just renting an antenna. That's all we're charging you for
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:07.820]   Really and it's cool. You can dvr the content too, right?
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:10.860]   They have a built-in renting an antenna and we will
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:15.180]   Record your favorite shows up to 40. I think it's 40 hours of content
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:19.580]   So if you want to watch the pbs news hour and you're just not home to watch it on time and I love that
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.660]   I don't want to wait for the podcast version of it
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:27.340]   Just dvr it on my area account. I can come home. I can watch it anytime. I want on my ipad. I'm not home
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:30.460]   But this is you know, this is why by the way
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:35.260]   This is the kind of thing that's gonna change this this company has three years max
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:38.460]   And then everything's on the internet and it doesn't matter anymore, right?
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:43.020]   Yeah, because I think this this is one of those transitional steps right now
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:47.260]   That we were talking about this forces this forces the broadcaster's hands
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:50.460]   Absolutely because if I want it, let's say
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:54.220]   And I'm curious how this will work right because we only have the new york market
[02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:59.340]   And I'm fascinated by how this is gonna unfold with a radio because I love the philadelphia philities issue now
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:07.180]   Right, so right now I pay for whatever it is 150 bucks a year for the mlb.tv app on my i on my ipad and on the here
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:09.180]   on apple tv
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:12.700]   Well, what if I got an aerial account in philadelphia?
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:16.540]   Could I do that and i'm sure people will right she can so I get an ear
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:18.700]   I don't know if you can and how that's all gonna unfold
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:24.700]   But if I got an aerial account in philadelphia and then i'm able to watch the phillities for $12 not $140
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:27.260]   Yeah
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.260]   Of course, there's a whole season so maybe it comes shakes out
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.900]   I don't know but you know, I mean that I don't know how this is all gonna shake out
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:36.380]   But I could be getting creative with where i'm getting my content from do I want to get phoenix news
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:40.220]   Because I'm used to be from phoenix and I live in new york city now. Can I do that?
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:44.620]   Yeah, these guys are basically gaming the system is what they're doing. Oh totally
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:47.100]   Yeah, and there's no defense
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:52.140]   Bad it's fine and it's good for cord cutters like me i'm coming up on five years cord cut and leo
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:57.660]   And I haven't regretted it one day the only times I regret it when it's like all right hbo
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:02:58.620]   I'll pay for your stuff
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.660]   But just give it to me on go or something but they don't give it to you right away
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:04.700]   They give it to you like game of thrones because you can't watch that right right?
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:08.380]   Right. Yeah, I can't and so I have to get it at a friend's house or something that if you're
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.540]   You know, especially if your friend's named the pirate bay
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:14.060]   My good
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:20.060]   It's frustratingly justified when like we were talking about one of my favorite shows it's on fx
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:25.580]   Okay, but I can't get it on demand after the show airs. I can buy it on iTunes though
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:32.780]   But a mc when breaking bad airs I can get the latest episodes of breaking bad and the walking dead
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:34.860]   But I can't get on demand
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:38.540]   Justified I have to pay for it. I have to wait till it comes on indeed. It's absurd
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:42.860]   Well, and I think companies like ario are temporarily going to do fine
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:45.660]   And what it's going to do it breaks the model so thoroughly
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:50.140]   They tried to fight it in court if they can't fight it in court then they just have to change the model
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:52.700]   Game of thrones
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:57.340]   Was on bit torrent within you know a few hours of its airing last week the premiere
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:04:01.420]   160 000 simultaneous peers
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:05.900]   The hbms response to that was interesting. What do they say?
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:10.460]   We're flattered. Good. That's the right response. What else are they gonna say?
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:13.100]   Right
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:17.740]   Yeah, you either criminalize it and freak out and throw it out. Yeah, you really like us
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:20.620]   Because the truth is that is that is a sign of tooth
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:25.340]   One that everyone really likes game of thrones and two it's really hard to get hbo without having a huge cable package
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:27.420]   You don't want to pay for it. So they got a
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:34.540]   Torrent freak estimated that a million downloads of game of thrones now. What's hbms real response make it available day of
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.780]   for purchase
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:42.220]   Right, why not and it's just ridiculous that hbms do that. I'm curious scott your setup because again
[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:46.780]   I'm fascinated by this and I know that I was I had that sort of aha moment
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:52.220]   I know that Andy and nadko has talked about this on mac break weekly trying to arrive at that 100 point and we're not there yet
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:55.820]   Right, we want live sports. We want all of this content one spot
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:59.020]   We're not there yet where we have one device that can do it all for us
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:03.980]   But I have to tell you when I got that little live dongle that stuck on the back of the boxy box
[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:08.380]   I think it's a boxy live or whatever it was and you just plug it in the back
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:12.380]   You plug it right into your cable and you get live television HD looks beautiful
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:16.540]   So you're getting those 20 channels you would get for for $12 a month from ario
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:19.100]   Are you getting them for free?
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:22.780]   But then you have on the boxy box you have the ability to launch mlb
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:28.940]   Launch Netflix launch youtube hundreds of apps that sort of thing and it's a little clunky and so forth
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:31.020]   You know, it's like a year old whatever a couple years old
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:34.620]   But that I had that sort of jaw dropping moment where I thought well
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:37.580]   Yeah, this could be really cool. I can flip between live television
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:42.700]   Then if I want to jump over and use the sling box app I can use that to watch some cable program
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:46.860]   So I don't know that was my sort of wow this could actually happen. What is your setup like?
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:52.620]   Well, it's a little I call it mad max the mad max approach. I mean, I'm definitely it's goofy
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:56.460]   So I'm getting justified date next day on iTunes. That's how I get justified
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:00.620]   I get other shows day of if they'll let me on different apps or different whatever
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:04.300]   I've got a roku running a whole bunch of stuff. We get a lot of Netflix content in the house
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:07.820]   That's really what my kids subsist on is as an Netflix content
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:12.060]   But it's this combination of all right. Well hulu has that one amazon prime has that one
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:15.820]   I'll get this other one off itunes and i'll put it on apple tv and this other one going to watch and
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:23.100]   In bed on my ipad anyways, I'll just subscribe to that through whatever app and it is a hodgepodge and it's not ideal
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:25.180]   but
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:29.580]   I have never once regretted to move the only regret I have is no live sports and I have an antenna for that
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.180]   So I do get that
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:35.340]   When I need live stuff work local new stuff or the oscars or something like that where it's a big deal
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:39.020]   And I need to cover it for show or whatever so I can get it those ways
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:43.260]   I just hate that it's so fragmented. It's all over the place where I get my stuff
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:48.220]   And that's the problem right now and i'm not i'm not even saying that one day we need to have one solution fits all
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:50.460]   I just need
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.180]   You know one
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:54.700]   I think I need all the companies to have the same philosophy that i'm willing to
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:57.100]   Buy your content the way I want to buy it
[02:06:57.100 --> 02:07:01.340]   Please give me avenues to do that and then I think we're almost to the 100 like you mentioned
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:05.820]   But I don't regret it. It's great. I get everything I want. I have some of it. I have to wait for some of that
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:12.380]   I don't but I get what I want I get it when I want it and you know, I can I can just just subsist and it's not a problem
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:18.460]   Except like that space in I think that space in our brain where we used to reserve for remembering people's phone numbers
[02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:23.340]   Is now use and reserve for remembering where the content lives on of those devices
[02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:29.020]   Did I download it? Is it on my shared computer for my apple tv or is it on is it on iTunes?
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:33.100]   Avon I cloud is on amazon prime like I don't remember my mom's phone number anymore
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.900]   But I do remember where I got that content from yeah
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:38.060]   Yeah, don't look now
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:45.580]   But uh mark zuckerberg's home page when he was 15 years old is apparently still on angel fire and man it's beautiful
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:48.540]   uh
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:52.940]   Internet explorer has blocked this site from installing an active x control. I won't do that
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:57.660]   So some of this functionality. Oh, let's allow the pop-ups from angel fire calm
[02:07:57.660 --> 02:08:02.700]   Some of this function it needs java some of this functionality will not work
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:05.900]   but uh, it's mark's home page and actually um
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:09.900]   It it might actually be this came us it showed up on um
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:11.740]   uh
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:15.500]   Hacker news and motherboarded a little research and in fact the email address
[02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:19.500]   on this original page points back to a
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:24.380]   Uh email address that was owned by marx father edward zuckerberg
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:30.780]   in fact, uh, the magnetic poetry page still works the java drawing tools still works

[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:50.300]   Yeah, it's still on the way back machine, but I was an adult remember. I'm an old man again
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:55.820]   So I my comic strip, which just my webcomers just hit just hit 12 years old or will hit in june
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:10:01.260]   Um, I remember the first one I made it was all hacked together using I want to say I use front page
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:03.900]   And I know that's embarrassing, but I think I use front page in a one
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:07.180]   2000 or something everybody did that back then that was
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:12.780]   I'm a back now in college university. That's like 100 years ago. I made a Bruce Lee page
[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:18.460]   Like it was like three pages deep. Well, let's look for it on the on the way back machine. Do you remember the URL?
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:24.540]   Oh my god. No, I mean it would have been under my name claiton Morris. I think at university of pittsburgh like
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:26.700]   1995
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:30.140]   Oh, I don't know that you'll be able to find that thing. I can find
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:33.180]   Here's this is from december 21st
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:37.180]   1996 I have earlier pages on this, but this was my
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.060]   earliest
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:45.900]   From the way back for the way back machine, but I was doing I think it was doing a radio show
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:50.700]   This was before technical design. I like it. Yeah. Yeah, how you like that, huh?
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:55.020]   Full circle. It's all coming back to that now. Yeah. Yeah
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:58.380]   I got sound effects
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:05.260]   You have spinning gifts like oh look at see the little speakers dancing. Yeah. Yeah, let me see if the email has a oh
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:08.380]   Some tables and tv s yeah
[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:14.300]   Yeah, tables and frames definitely. I wonder if it had a little email icon with a mailbox that opens up
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:16.700]   different web ring
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:21.420]   Oh, I definitely have a web ring of course. Yeah. Yeah, the machine. Let's see. Let's see what else is here
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:25.660]   So that's that's the way back machine the internet archive. There's still saving all this stuff
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:29.420]   This is a smoke-free website. I don't even know what that is. That's a mistake
[02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:35.180]   Pretty strange stuff
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:38.460]   That's 1997, but I know there's earlier ones than this
[02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:45.100]   Clayton Morris is at Fox and Friends and uh you I am told want to do a little a little mitzvah
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:48.380]   For our viewers today. Oh fine may
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:53.980]   Yes, please. Yeah, just a few hours ago. It takes a few hours to propagate, but it's now live. I said, you know what? Hey, I'm doing twit tonight
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:57.580]   I'll make it uh, you know built an iPad app called read quick
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:01.900]   It's been in the top 10 of news apps now for three and a half months going strong
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:06.460]   It kind of goes out to 13 then it drops down to eight then it's back in 10. So thank you to everyone who
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:12.060]   Uh has purchased it, but tonight only or for a few days actually when you listen to this on twit
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:19.820]   Uh big discount from 399 down to 99 cents to anyone who wants to uh download it for twit listeners only
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:23.900]   So how do we do that? How do we just got to go to a special
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:27.340]   Or no, no, it should be just do it. No, I just
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:31.180]   Yeah, yeah, it's 99. I switched it over for you
[02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:34.700]   Uh, so it went from 399 down to 99 cents read quick
[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:38.220]   It's the fastest way to read your insta paper your pocket archive
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:39.660]   We just teamed up with tech meme
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:45.740]   So now you just tap on the featured partners list there and you'll see tech memes you can read all your tech meme news giga home
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:52.060]   Um the feature long reads in fact that a non tech article you were talking about earlier on the htc one. Yeah
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:59.420]   Even at 600 words per minute. That's what I said it on the train today. It still took me 37 minutes to read a non tech
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.580]   And here's the thing clinton read it one word at a time
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:05.580]   Yeah
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:07.820]   One word at a time your comprehension goes up
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:11.020]   Um and uh and you can read your
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:16.300]   Full archive we're working on an iphone version. Oh good phone version is coming very soon
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:21.500]   That's the number one requested feature and we're also working on books. Welcome people to beg to get booked
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:26.940]   This is good. This is for books clinton morris. He doesn't make enough money as an anchor at fox and friends
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:29.020]   No, he also has to make millions
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:30.620]   Within an app
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:33.580]   Millions or with millions of dollars with an app here you go ready
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:36.540]   See how fast that goes, but you can read it
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:39.340]   And now am I and i'm learning speed reading right?
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:41.100]   Martin all right clinton
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:46.460]   Yeah, in fact your most human beings read it about 230 words per minute right now very slowly
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:53.660]   And then you know, I've had like all my beta testers over the year. It's been fantastic. They're like 500 600 words per minute
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:14:00.940]   Who'll be blown away? Dude. Now does that carry over to reading just normal paragraphs or is it only in that app that you can read that fast?
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:06.140]   Yeah, because you know what you're doing you're training your your brain to get out of the way of verbalizing everything you read
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:07.980]   You know when you tip back in your
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:09.980]   You verbal not supposed to do that
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:13.900]   Is to get beyond the point verbalizing just absorbing their information
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:19.900]   You absorb the information your comprehension will go up. We've had professors writing us telling us that they have their entire class
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:24.540]   Downloading it and they're reading Jane Eyre and i'm like, how are you doing that? We don't have books available yet
[02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:30.220]   They're literally importing it chapter by chapter and they're blazing through these like 500 page books as a result of it
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:36.620]   I'm I'm just like blown away and flattered by it. So tonight only 99 cents for twit listeners over the next few days
[02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:39.180]   When is the android app coming out?
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:43.100]   We are working on that also people and asking for android app as well. And so
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:47.980]   Yeah, it's it's just started as a little hobby for me to like read through all the news
[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:51.660]   I have to read for for work and people have been asking more for it
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:54.780]   So I said all right keep it going and make it as good as we can
[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:58.060]   Ignab it. I'm gonna have to do it
[02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:04.220]   You convinced me I was a skeptic I was because it just seemed like it was going too fast, but I think I'm gonna try it
[02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:07.340]   Yeah, I trust me once you start
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:13.180]   When you touch on tech meme and you start you're literally done with your entire tech meme queue within like a few minutes
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:16.460]   You're like, oh my god. I know every story in tech news today and i'm done
[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:19.900]   That's so good. That's so good. I gotta do that
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:26.620]   Quick read quick and then you find it on the app store. Just search for read quick two words, right read space quick
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:33.180]   Yeah, yeah, yeah read quick read quick anything else you want to plug you've got podcast too

[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:12.780]   Let's just show you a little bit of what you might have missed if you didn't watch twit all week long
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:18.780]   Previously on twit ipad today. You don't declare your cats as dependents to you
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:23.660]   They are dependent on me. You know how much money i spend on them every if you send them to college
[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:30.220]   You'll be saving money. Well, they're getting swimming lessons. I think you had a business cat swimming lessons people would hire you
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:36.460]   They call you the cat swimming lady. I know this is just a fantasy. I'm not that crazy
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.700]   I just like to pretend that I love it
[02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:42.460]   Windows weekly there seems to be a ghost on a
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:45.580]   On some sort of exercise
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:51.660]   In the back there and I like it that you put a napkin over it because that makes it much less obvious
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:58.060]   Even just so, you know part of the fun of the show pre-show is mocking
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:18:59.980]   Paul's shot
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:01.340]   NSFW

[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:23.980]   I'm gonna pretend that you're not mentioning baby einstein specifically because I made you sit there and watch it
[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:26.300]   Well, I tried to put my daughter to sleep two weeks ago
