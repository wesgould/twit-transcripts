[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.680]   a panel of people who are back from Vegas,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.560]   starting with Father Robert Ballaser,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.160]   hosted this week at Enterprise Tech.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   He was at Vegas.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   Indeed, and I don't believe I brought back a flu.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.400]   This will be a first in Sunday.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.440]   I know, I know.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.960]   Did you wash your, what was your secret?
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.040]   My secret was I shook hands as little as possible,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.280]   was mostly fist bumps.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.600]   And I had two pocketfuls of hand sanitizer.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.440]   Yeah, smart.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.280]   And the happy fork.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   And, well, you can't do anything without the happy fork.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.560]   I want to talk about the happy fork in a second.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.360]   Before we do, let's introduce Mr. Will Harris of Channel Flip.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.000]   Also in Vegas.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.200]   Yes, I think my brain is still there.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.560]   Were you there for meetings or because you love it?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.800]   Well, lots of meetings.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.880]   So one of my interesting themes of CES
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.400]   is the increasing mediaization of consumer electronics.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.080]   Oh, God.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.520]   Oh, I think CES now is really pretty much a press show.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.160]   And lots and lots of media companies.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.360]   Bloggers, new media.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.760]   Trying to get in on the sort of latest technology.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560]   So I think, you know, lots of late nights,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.760]   lots of meetings.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.280]   Is this on behalf of Channel Flip?
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.280]   OK, good.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.680]   So all sorts of interesting Google meetings and things going on.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.480]   Cool.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.840]   And this is my first time in the Twist Studio.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's really nice to have you in person.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   We have you by a Skype.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.480]   It's so fun.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   Yeah, it was good to have you here.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.080]   It's gorgeous here.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.600]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.960]   Also Roger Chang of Tekzilla.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.320]   Yes.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.400]   Great to see you again.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.880]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   My good buddy, Annie East Meets West.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.640]   You still do that, right?
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.200]   Yes.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.240]   Now on a very infrequent basis.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.840]   Well, Tom's moved to LA.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.280]   Yes.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.920]   Sad.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.280]   Come out with a new schedule.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.920]   So before we talk about some of the things you guys saw,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.280]   we suppose we should talk about all the cool gadgets you saw.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.920]   What do you think of the CBS CNET thing?
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   Oh.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   I think--
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.120]   So I want-- because I want to emphasize
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.120]   that we are not beholden to anybody.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   And so what we say about this trade show
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.000]   will not be in any way.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.800]   Influence CNET, which has a long and somewhat glorious
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.720]   tradition of tech news coverage, gives the best of CES awards
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.120]   each year.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.760]   They've done so for some times since Tech TV stopped doing it,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.160]   I think.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.040]   I think G4 took over and then--
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.440]   And then, well, Tech TV/G4, yeah.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.200]   They nominated the Dish DVR Hopper.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.640]   As a finalist in their best of CES awards,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.080]   Hopper is a very cool product.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   Let's you record multiple channels.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.240]   I think all of them major networks at the same time.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.200]   Prime time.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.480]   And then, skip the commercials, which
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.600]   has brought them under the scrutiny and eventually lawsuits
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.440]   from most of the major networks, including
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.840]   CNET's parent company CBS.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.880]   CBS apparently objected to CNET putting the Hopper
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   on their best of awards because of the lawsuit.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.080]   And the Hopper was disqualified shortly
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.600]   before the winners were announced.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.840]   CNET attached a disclaimer to its list of award finalists.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.760]   Good for CNET for saying it because they could have just
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.360]   gone-- instead, they said the Dish Hopper with Sling
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.160]   was removed from consideration due to active litigation
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.080]   involving our parent company, CBS Corp.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.160]   And this is the sad thing.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.200]   We will no longer be reviewing products manufactured
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.480]   by companies with which we are in litigation with respect
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.880]   to such product.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   Oh, it's horrible.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.680]   This is the nightmares-- or one of the nightmares
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.040]   for journalists, right?
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.680]   To have the advertising arm reach in,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.240]   have the legal arm reach in and tell you what you can and cannot
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.040]   cover, or even worse, tell you what you can or cannot award.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.360]   I mean, I have friends in the industry who were bemoaning
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.680]   this the minute they heard it.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.400]   They said the only reasonable thing to do
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.240]   is for the CNET editors to quit.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.360]   I don't think they can do that.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.800]   I mean--
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   Well, they could do that.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.520]   They could do it because they have to feed their kids.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.040]   Exactly.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.080]   But I mean, that's the kind of angst that this has drawn out.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.200]   I've had friends who say, I will not have anyone tell me
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   what score I'm going to give a product.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.520]   I will not have anyone tell me which one I'm going to recommend.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   This is even worse.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.880]   This is a company who is not even ashamed to say, yeah,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.080]   we are not going to cover you if you sue us.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.200]   Or if you're involved in litigation with you.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.480]   Right.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.280]   That's just--
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.920]   Oh.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.800]   But I think it's going to become an increasing problem
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.000]   because one of the trends that we're seeing in the last few years
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.880]   is the increase--
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.680]   Right.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.120]   The mediation of technology.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.400]   The fact that big technology companies are getting into media,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.840]   big media companies getting into technology,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.440]   and these kind of legal spats are in many ways so common
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.120]   that they are always going to start to throw up editorial issues.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.640]   I mean, you see any of the big newspaper companies
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.400]   that are always suing each other.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.320]   And it just becomes a nightmare for the journalists.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.480]   I think--
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.160]   You're on by discovery now.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.800]   Yes.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.960]   This could happen to you.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.800]   Potentially, yeah.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.440]   I mean, right now, at least, tax sales content does not
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.560]   dovetail or any of discovery's current offerings.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.360]   But I think it's misleading to assume
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.800]   that this is somehow new.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.480]   I think this has been the case for decades on.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.000]   I mean--
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.640]   Never happened to AssetTech TV.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.280]   Well, we had a very strong editorial kind of firewall
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.440]   that was--
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.160]   For that reason.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.920]   For that reason.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:31.360]   And I think at some point, when news became more of a product
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.840]   than actual information, when CNN came online,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.600]   and, hey, look, we now have a product we can sell,
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.200]   suddenly became an asset.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.560]   And any time you involve large amounts of money,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.320]   people start--
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.720]   Yeah, it starts with-- you always get a slippery slope.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.960]   You start somewhere where, well, maybe you won't cover it.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   We'll just kind of ignore it.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   And suddenly, it starts rolling into censorship,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.160]   into selective bias.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.800]   I mean, that's the whole concept behind gatekeeping, right?
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.640]   You let people know what's important,
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.600]   based on what you consider to be good or not.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.880]   I think it hurts us as tech journalists, though, doesn't it?
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.360]   Because now the perception is, oh, you know.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.840]   Well, I also wonder if it really hurts CES as sort of an entity.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.320]   But it hurts.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:11.920]   You know who it hurts?
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.880]   It's CBS.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   Well, because CESES--
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.240]   This used to be the Tiffany network.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.400]   Now they clearly have no dedication
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.240]   to journalism on that.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.520]   Because CESES is like the official press partner.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.200]   Oh, goodbye.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.560]   And CES--
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.000]   And they do the--
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.360]   Yes, they pull the plug on this.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.280]   Yeah, because if you--
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.800]   If you're CES--
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   Yes.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.880]   --the press partner, censoring what they're going to cover.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.840]   First thing I'm dish first thing I do
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.360]   is I go to the Consumer Electronics Association
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   that organizes CES and say, under no circumstances,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.960]   can these awards be handled by a corrupt organization,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.160]   like CNET ever again?
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.400]   Or just a company with a vested interest.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.240]   A conflict of interest.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.760]   A conflict of interest.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   Because you will run into that issue time and again.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.000]   You know, somebody asked me, I gave a keynote on Monday
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.920]   at the podcast towards new media experts.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.160]   Somebody asked me, should I syndicate my content?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.280]   Should I partner up with big media?
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.040]   And I said, under no circumstances.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.600]   And this was before this came out.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.160]   But I said, even then, every time we've talked about doing
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.120]   this with other big media entities,
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.680]   there's been an impedance mismatch.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.240]   And when it comes down to the final deal,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   it always doesn't fit.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.400]   And I always pull back because I don't
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.960]   want to be put in a situation like that.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.080]   You know what strikes me is that I come from sort of the home
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.480]   podcaster background.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.640]   I don't have training in journalism.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.600]   And so I always look to the big organizations
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.840]   to sort of take my lead from.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.040]   This is how I should be acting.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.280]   Yeah, that's not true anymore.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.880]   Exactly.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.240]   If I'm a home podcaster, I can say, well,
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.360]   if CNET's going to do this, why can I just
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.160]   chill for a company that's going to hand me
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.280]   a bucket full of money?
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.320]   Right.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.000]   Well, as you said, if I'm going to sell it,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I'm going to sell it for a lot.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.200]   That's the reason I have--
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.720]   Because I'll have no career after that.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.400]   If I ever did that, it would have to be so much money.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.200]   We would have to be--
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.040]   You have to wait again.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.800]   --but they come a few money.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.960]   I'd have to be able to walk away and say,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.640]   I don't care if I have any credibility.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.280]   But the minute you do that, your credibility,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.360]   your integrity are gone.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.000]   And it's almost impossible to recover.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And I just feel really hard.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.520]   I feel really sorry for the guys, CNET, who are not
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.160]   the senior editors or not that you know--
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.680]   They're stuck.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.160]   --super.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:03.880]   You're going to rock.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.400]   You've been going to rock in a hard place.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   Right.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.840]   You can't-- you either stop earning a paycheck
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.960]   or you totally lose your principles.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.880]   And who's in the positions?
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.400]   Do that.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.920]   I have a home for each and every one of them.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.480]   And the tech especially, it's so incestuous.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.520]   If you put yourself on a blacklist
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.160]   by doing something like that, who else can take you?
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   And it's such a competitive market
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.080]   that they can easily say, well, we can replace you.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.880]   We'll find that to be something that is--
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   And they're just sell out.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.280]   And the thing is, this has been going on kind of bit by bit
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.040]   with tech crunch investing in companies that it covers.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.960]   This has been happening more and more.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.560]   And the attitude has always been, disclose it and it's OK.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.160]   And this is what the end result is.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.360]   And I've been warning against this.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.560]   People say, no, no.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.120]   As long as we disclose it, everybody knows who's in whose
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.360]   pocket it's OK.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.960]   No, it's not.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.800]   Because what happens is things like this,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.600]   where you actually get legitimate contenders for a prize,
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.320]   removed for consideration.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.520]   Because the parent corporation says you better not.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.720]   I mean, like, card journalism used to be--
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.240]   Right.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.600]   --with that--
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   --with decades.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.520]   That's-- and whenever you're a trade press,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.120]   you've got to watch out about that, right?
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.240]   I mean, it's-- I mean, hey, let's talk about our new car.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.440]   We're going to fly out to an island in the middle of the Aegean.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.160]   And you get to drive a really super amazing sports car.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.840]   We'll put you up.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.960]   We'll feed you food.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.280]   We'll fly you both ways.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.560]   Four-star companies just say something nice.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.120]   And then you get a bunch of fluff, generally five to six pages
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.480]   long.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.840]   Actually, I saw a great article on Gizmodo this week,
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.720]   which was one of the writers who said, you know,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.600]   we all know that PR is basically just a shill to try and get--
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.480]   give you free stuff to get something out of you.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.800]   He said, I got so fed up with this when I was at CS this week.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.840]   I was so tired and so achy and so ill.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.400]   I just tweeted, I will write anything about anybody's product
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.840]   just give someone will give me a back rub.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.480]   A back rub?
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.680]   A back rub?
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.400]   And so the guy tweeted it.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.120]   And within five minutes, he got a headphone company that
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.920]   sent a masseuse to where he was on the show floor, gave him
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.520]   a back rub.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.960]   And he said, here is-- and I'm writing about these, whatever
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.840]   it was, headphones.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.480]   They sound really good, really interesting.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   And they're really relaxing.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.160]   And they're very relaxing.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.560]   He said, this is CS distilled to its purest--
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.360]   and I thought, yeah, that's possible.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.960]   And you know, I'll be honest, there's
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.440]   some companies that don't get it.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.000]   I mean, I'm not going to name any particular names,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.920]   but we did a review for a product on TechSillin.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.200]   The CEO kept calling me back, asking me to review it again.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.040]   It's like, well, no.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.840]   I mean, there was nothing wrong with the initial review.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.920]   It's like, you know, done.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.800]   You want me to review it because, you know,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.280]   so it becomes more favorable.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.320]   And it's just like, no, that's not the idea behind it.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.920]   That does happen from time to time.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.360]   We've always gotten that in Tech TV.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.120]   We got it.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   And you just ignore it.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.920]   And most companies are savvy enough to know,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.120]   you get a bad review, you get a bad review, you move on.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.680]   Some companies get punitive about it.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.840]   Life goes on, right?
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.360]   Will, that is a great idea.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.040]   I already have three offers for a back rub.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.120]   Keep tweeting.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120]   Keep tweeting.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.480]   All right.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.000]   Anyway, I thought we should bring that up up front.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.320]   We will talk about CES.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.160]   And I also-- I don't know.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   This is such a sad story.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.360]   I hate to dwell on it, but we're going
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.760]   to talk about Aaron Swartz because a huge story.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.040]   And if we don't talk about it, you know,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.840]   it's the kind of thing that mainstream media is not
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.280]   going to be able to understand or make any sense of it.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.360]   But we can, and we should talk about it.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.240]   We will.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.520]   His death and his legacy was, and what he
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.080]   meant to the world of technology in just a little bit.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.560]   You know, somebody in the chat room said,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.160]   hey, how is it different from taking ad money?
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.680]   We do.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.280]   We take ad money.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.680]   We're very clear when it's an ad, right?
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.600]   And we know.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.640]   I would love not to take ad money,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.360]   but I don't know of any other way to fund the business.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.920]   And we certainly don't change our editorial coverage
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.160]   of advertisers because of that.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.800]   I think we could go even further.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.840]   I mean, just from my experience with Twit,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.600]   whenever I get a new ad read, one of the things that's always
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.680]   told to me is--
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.880]   You don't have to do it.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.960]   A, I don't have to do it.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.440]   That was the very first thing that you told me.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   If you're not comfortable doing an ad, you don't have to do it.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.360]   The second thing is, I was told, we don't disparage
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.440]   the competitors.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.680]   My job is not to go in there and say, oh, I love them.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   They're in the end.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.920]   And I hate that company.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.440]   We don't do that.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.000]   That's-- I think that's what makes it different.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.400]   There are rules for saying this is an ad, this is who supports us.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.840]   And if you like us, please support them.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.760]   This with CBS was completely different.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.080]   This is, we want to punish this company
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.840]   because we're at odds with them legally.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.160]   We don't like what they do, so we're going to punish them.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.520]   Anyway, I'm going to do an ad anyway.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.840]   So there.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.680]   Because if I don't, great segue.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.360]   I don't know how we keep the lights on.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.400]   There are power bills like $4,000 a month.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.880]   Wow.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.880]   So I'm going to--
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   Do you know, looking at this, that doesn't surprise me.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.680]   Look at all these lights.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.440]   With somebody for crying out loud, with somebody turn off a light.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.840]   And what's with the fire?
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   Turn up!
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   Close the door.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.240]   I made the money.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.640]   When it's worthwhile, Leo, it makes you look beautiful.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   It does.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640]   Even for a little while.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.840]   So they just turned off the lights.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   And I feel like I'm saving money, but maybe the wrong way.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.480]   I think they turned off the wrong light.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.000]   Thanks, Chad.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.600]   I didn't even know we could turn off the lights.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.280]   So that was a revelation right there.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.320]   That was good.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.960]   Our show today brought you by the great folks at stamps.com.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.240]   This is a postage pro tip.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   I love the word pro tip.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.720]   Chad, you, I think, the first person ever
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.040]   gave me a pro tip.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.720]   I was playing Skyrim.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.560]   You said pro tip.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.720]   You want a pro tip, Leo?
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.320]   Yeah, here's a pro tip.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.000]   I like that phrase pro tip.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.560]   It's like, this is stuff pros know.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.600]   And the pros know, if you're doing mailing,
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.240]   you don't go to the post office to buy stamps.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.720]   I guess that should be fairly obvious.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.440]   It's a waste of time.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.200]   You're waiting in a line park and all that stuff.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.080]   When there's a better way.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   Now, maybe the pros think the right way
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.160]   to do it is a postage meter, but that's not
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.240]   the modern way to do it.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.640]   You do not need a postage meter.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.240]   So funny, because I see people waiting in line
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.840]   to post office with their postage meters
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.720]   to get them recharged.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.640]   You don't need that.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.560]   You don't need special ink.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   You've got a computer, right?
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.680]   You've got a printer, right?
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.320]   That's all you need.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.000]   Oh, when stamps.com lets you buy and print US postage
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.560]   from your computer, your printer.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.480]   You don't need anything else.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.600]   No special ink.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.920]   No postage meter.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.280]   You could print right on the envelope,
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.160]   which means you could put your company logo, the postage.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.200]   In fact, stamps.com will pull the address
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   and the information from your address book, from QuickBooks.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.400]   If you're an eBay or Amazon Etsy paper,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.480]   if you sell stuff online, it'll put it right from the website.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.560]   So you're not typing in addresses.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.840]   You're just printing right on the envelope.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.880]   You're printing right on the sticker for the package.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.760]   It will automatically send out emails
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.120]   with tracking numbers for priority mail and express mail.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.560]   Automatically.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.480]   It's just the fastest, easiest way
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   to turn yourself into a professional shipper.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.600]   So if you do a lot of mailing, you really
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   want to use stamps.com.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   You also get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.320]   Up to 21% on express mail up to 15% on priority mail.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.920]   It gives you international mail too, fills out the forms
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.800]   where you're certified mail, fills out the forms for you.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.680]   There really is no easier way, no more accurate way to mail.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.040]   And when you get that scale, now you always
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.120]   have exactly the right postage.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.320]   You just plop the letter of package on the scale.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.920]   Boom, it prints out the right postage.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.880]   Now, here's the scale.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.200]   Here's the deal.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.280]   If you go to stamps.com, look at this special offer $80.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.640]   Wait a minute, 25.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.160]   That's nice.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.120]   That seems like you got $25 free postage.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.200]   You get the scale.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.720]   That seems nice.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.960]   But I've got a better deal for you.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.560]   Click the microphone and enter the offer code
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.160]   "Twit" on the resulting page.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.160]   And the $80 bonus value turns into a $110 value.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.280]   It's more free postage.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.240]   You can use over several months.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.160]   You get the digital scale.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.840]   You get a $5 supply kit and you get a four-week trial.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.640]   Stamps.com, make sure you use the offer code "Twit."
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   That way we get credit and you get the extra postage
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.400]   as a way of saying thank you.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.480]   It's how we do our mailing here.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.920]   And it really is the best way.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.240]   Stamps.Jessica Corbin, I got a--
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.600]   I bought her Fitness RX.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.440]   Have you seen tried that yet?
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   Jessica used to work with us.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.160]   She makes a thing that measures your vitality and stuff.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.080]   It's an iPhone app.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.440]   I got it, stamps.com.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.480]   She's smart.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.240]   She watches.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.680]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   Jabs says, why are your commercials so loud?
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.280]   Because I'm talking louder.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   I don't know.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.200]   Are commercials louder?
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.240]   Do we turn up-- Jad, do you turn up the commercials?
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.040]   I don't.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.680]   I'm going to talk more quietly for now.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.600]   Just bring it down.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.040]   Bring it down.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.760]   I think it's because the rest of us aren't talking.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.360]   That's fine.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.400]   Hey, before we get back to CES, I
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.880]   think we should mention Aaron Swartz.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   What an interesting fella.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.160]   Teen prodigy, if you read Corey Doctorow on Boing Boing
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.400]   had a very touching, heartfelt eulogy for Aaron.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.080]   Larry Lessig, who knew Aaron, had a very touching eulogy.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.360]   Everybody seemed to know this kid,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.160]   starting with around the age of 14,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.080]   when he started showing up at computer conferences
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.440]   and trade shows.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.360]   He was right about that age when he helped
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.160]   write the specification for RSS, which we use every day.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.480]   That's how we do podcasts.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:17.680]   He wrote some of the early code for Reddit
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.520]   and sold the code to Reddit.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.280]   And he's sometimes called a founder.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.080]   I don't think that's quite accurate,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:30.120]   but he certainly wrote much of the code that Reddit's running.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.200]   And he became a political activist in a very interesting way.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.040]   Larry Lessig wrote.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.400]   He was brilliant and funny, a kid genius, a soul, a conscience.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.680]   The source of a question I've asked myself a million times.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.720]   What would Aaron think?
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.480]   This is Larry Lessig, the Harvard constitutional law
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   professor.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.840]   Unfortunately, Aaron committed suicide,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.400]   killed himself on Friday at the age of 26.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.160]   And Larry Lessig and many others, including the family,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.520]   blamed the US government.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.920]   Larry says that person has gone today,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.720]   driven to the edge by what a decent society would only
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.000]   call bullying.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.040]   I get wrong, but I also get proportionality.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.480]   And if you don't get both, you don't
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.040]   deserve to have the power of the United States government
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.000]   behind you.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.920]   Here's what happened.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.160]   Aaron believed, like all hackers, that information
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.920]   wants to be free.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.400]   There's a video of Aaron speaking.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.680]   He started freeing information early on.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.320]   It's interesting.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.680]   He liberated--
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.960]   That's a great way of fighting it.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.480]   The US legal code.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.880]   So there's a system called PACER that gives you,
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.440]   in the United States, gives us access to case law, paid access
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.920]   to case law.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.080]   Now case law is public domain.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.640]   Case law is what all the courts have ruled about stuff.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.000]   It's what you would use if you were defending yourself
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   with the presidents, what the legal presidents are.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.200]   Every lawyer has a law library, but then they also
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.480]   go online to PACER.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.880]   And for a fee, they download these judgments.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.560]   But those judgments belong to all of us.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.520]   They're public domain.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.400]   They're the US courts.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.880]   So activists built something called recap
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.160]   and encouraged its users to take their case law
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.360]   downloads after they did it and post them on recap,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.680]   perfectly legal.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.160]   Because it's our stuff.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.760]   And recap was free and open.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.040]   And anybody can use it.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.160]   Well, Aaron took some of the money
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.720]   he made from the sale of Reddit and bought 20% of the PACER
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.480]   content and posted it on recap.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.120]   That's a guy who believes information should be free.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.560]   He got in trouble with the feds.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.160]   The FBI investigated him.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.640]   Corey Doctorow says it looked like he'd
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.000]   be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.840]   but he escaped it all on a merge triumphant.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.880]   Because in fact, he didn't break any laws.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   And one other thing to do.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.360]   But he did raise the ire of the United States federal law
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:48.880]   enforcement.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.000]   He annoyed a lot of people today.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.880]   He annoyed people.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.520]   He founded a group called Demand Progress, which
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.000]   was one of the real effective groups of fighting
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.680]   Sopa and Pippa last year.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:08.840]   He did something that was a little reckless, let's say.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.560]   There is another database, kind of like the PACER database.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.480]   It's called JSTOR.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.040]   It's an academic journal database.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.400]   And it charges money for access to academic journals.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.600]   Now, these aren't quite exactly in the public domain.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.680]   Some of these studies were paid for by the federal fund.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.760]   Some of the studies were academic and paid for by universities.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.840]   But it's often been a bone of contention
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.320]   that this stuff for society's sake
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.160]   should be widely available.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.960]   Scientific journals, anybody should be able to access them,
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.080]   shouldn't have to pay for it.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.120]   He was associated with Harvard.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.760]   Harvard had an account with JSTOR.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.800]   He used his legitimate account.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.160]   But he did something JSTOR says you can't do,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.640]   which is download in bulk.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.480]   He in fact took a laptop, snuck it into MIT,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.880]   put it in the closet in MIT.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.000]   And had it in the closet.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.480]   And downloaded it.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.360]   And downloaded the entire database.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.960]   You want to think 20%?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.760]   Is it that little?
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.480]   I thought it was more.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.360]   Anyway, gigabytes.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.240]   No, he took all of it.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.720]   He took all of it.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.400]   It's a lot.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:02.920]   I don't know how much.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   Yes, he took a lot.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:11.560]   JSTOR, when they caught him-- actually, he turned himself in.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.880]   JSTOR and MIT decided to prosecute.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.200]   The feds, of course, said, yeah, we finally got this kid.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.720]   Eventually, JSTOR backed down.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.160]   In fact, an interesting thing, JSTOR just a few weeks ago
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.800]   decided to make all of that information public anyway.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.040]   MIT, according to Lesseg, was a little more
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.440]   equivocal in its backing down, giving the prosecutors,
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.000]   the federal prosecutors, sufficient reason
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.480]   to continue forward.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.520]   Aaron was facing 50 years in jail, a $4 million fine.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.080]   The trial was to come in April.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.160]   Now, totally disproportionate.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.320]   Totally disproportionate.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.280]   They were treating him like a terrorist.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.640]   They were trying to make an example out of it.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.840]   They implied that he was stealing this data to sell it,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.800]   which he wasn't.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.120]   He wanted to make it publicly available.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.520]   However, he did break laws.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.040]   Although--
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.320]   Just not really 50 years worth of all of this.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.720]   Not 50 years.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.480]   Now, Corey writes, Aaron was a person who
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.320]   had problems with depression for many years.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.920]   He'd written about the subject publicly,
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.840]   talked about it with his friends.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040]   And of course, there are many things
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.120]   that might cause a person to want to take his own life.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.120]   But his friends, his family, and Larry Lesseg
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.480]   do think that the unreasonable disproportionate reaction
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.080]   of the federal government had something
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.600]   to do with it.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.960]   The thought of being in prison for 50 years
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.800]   might have had something to do with it.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.600]   So our deepest condolences to all who knew Aaron Swartz,
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.160]   to his family, to his partner.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.600]   It is just a horrible tragedy.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.040]   I don't think that it's really appropriate to say it's
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.320]   all the Fed's fault, but it's certainly appropriate to shine
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.480]   a light on their inappropriate prosecution.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.840]   And I think it's of great loss for all of us.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.520]   It's very sad.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.040]   You know what I think?
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.440]   I think one of the things we can take--
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.080]   or, I mean, there are an interesting couple of things
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   that are happening.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.040]   Academics are starting to post PDFs of some of the material,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.720]   an open source thing, and put it in Twitter,
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.600]   so that it's sort of like a tribute to make
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.720]   some information free.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.920]   But I think one of the other things
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.600]   that we can really take away from this
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.120]   is kind of a serious and slightly grim now,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.640]   is that mental health and depression
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.000]   is something that affects a lot of people.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.600]   It affects a lot of people in the geek and nerd community.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.400]   Many of us kind of-- you can laugh at office being a little bit--
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   I don't know if they're antisocial, because I'm a bit of a geek.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.200]   But I think we all have a little bit of responsibility
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.760]   just to try and look after the people that are nearest,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.800]   and try and get people to get help if they need it.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.760]   Now, Larry points out that Aaron had many friends
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.120]   in San Francisco.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.720]   He was beloved by many.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.120]   He was not somebody who was cut off from society.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.000]   I don't want to even speculate on what happened.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.080]   The expert witness who was going to testify on his behalf,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.800]   Alex Stamos, who was a computer security and forensic experts,
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.760]   called the case vindictive.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:13.040]   He said that Aaron did not hack the JSTOR website.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.320]   He just wrote-- for any reasonable definition of hack,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.040]   he wrote a handful of basic Python scripts
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.920]   that discovered the URLs of articles,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.120]   then used curl to request them.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.920]   He did not use parameter tampering.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.560]   He did not break a capture.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.240]   He did not do anything sneaky.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.720]   He did not cover his tracks or hide his activity.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.320]   The government provided no evidence
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.520]   that these downloads caused a negative effect on either JSTOR or MIT.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.640]   Sorry, sir.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.960]   Beyond the tragedy of losing someone who was so intelligent,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.240]   who was a visionary, who was actually fighting
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.680]   for the free information rights of anyone
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.280]   who's ever used an electronic resource,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.240]   I think there's another story here
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.680]   which is how desperate the DOJ and the federal government
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.360]   is to have some sort of strong case that
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:11.080]   establishes their version of copyright and property laws
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.000]   in the digital domain.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.160]   We saw it with the defeat of SOPA and PIPA.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.840]   We saw it with the bungled prosecution of Kim.com
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.440]   and mega upload, and we see it here.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.600]   And they're so desperate for a win
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.040]   that I think that's where that bully attitude comes into.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.840]   We want to make an example out of you.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.400]   There's also a fear of technology
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.480]   that drives a little bit of this.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.160]   I think some of the overreaction to hacking in general is this fear.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.800]   We've only got a look at the composition of the Congressional Science Committee,
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.240]   which is full of people that don't believe in science.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.440]   Don't like science.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.520]   You know, that's not a great deal.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.200]   So I think, you know, again, it's one of those things where
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.960]   I feel like changes in some of these cases is generational,
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.760]   that you get a new generation of lawmakers,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.160]   or a new generation of people in power, in government, in society.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.280]   And attitudes change along with that.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.960]   But there's always the guys that want to go down
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.440]   kicking and screaming on the way out.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   Yep.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.640]   This is just horrible.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.280]   But it's horrible.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.720]   So Brewster Cale of archive.org,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.200]   Karl Malamud, who is the transparent government activist,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.560]   and others have created an electronic Aaron Schwartz
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.320]   collection on archive.org.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.760]   The web team of the internet archive,
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.280]   writes Brewster have been archiving all the Aaron SW sites they're finding.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   Aaron has quite a few.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.640]   And if you have some digital archives, email photos, code,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   the Aaron Schwartz collection is right now going up on archive.org/details/
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.840]   Aaron SW.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.480]   I think this is a wonderful idea to save all this stuff.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.200]   And interesting things happening on Twitter.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.520]   Have you seen the PDF protest?
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.440]   An anonymous has gotten behind this, which is kind of interesting.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.400]   If you search for-- what is it?
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.840]   PDF.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.760]   Can't remember if it's protest.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.080]   Academics are posting links to PDFs--
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.680]   I'm sorry, PDF tribute is the hashtags.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.480]   Look at PDF tribute.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   The first post is from anonymous.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.600]   Please share academics posting their papers online
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.160]   and tribute to Aaron Schwartz using the hashtag PDF tribute.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.080]   So they're uploading, in some cases, illegally,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.000]   because they don't own the rights to it, academic articles that
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.600]   should be part of the commons, because this is stuff
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.360]   that we all need to know.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.640]   And then they're posting it on Twitter.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   Freeing the information.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:45.120]   I think that's a really wonderful tribute to him, too.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.200]   Good going.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   And if you're a researcher or a scientist
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.640]   and you want to do this in honor of Aaron, please do.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.320]   I never met him.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:56.800]   I don't know him.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.520]   I know many people who did know him, including Corey and Larry
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.800]   Lessig, Dave Weiner.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.040]   Many people, Doc Serrels.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.400]   Doc has a picture of him at 14 with Dave Weiner in the background.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.320]   He's writing RSS, the RSS spec.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.400]   You know what's interesting is he could have just taken what
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.880]   he knew and his talent, and he could have just amassed himself
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.920]   a personal fortune.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.680]   He could have cashed out.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.440]   He could have cashed out.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.720]   He could have totally went like the route
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.800]   that we see today, where people become superstars
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.400]   and they can trade on their name for for all sorts of favors,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.920]   and he didn't.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.080]   He actually became a very proactive in making sure
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.560]   that he held on to his beliefs despite all the stuff that
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.640]   happened to him.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:49.120]   And I think what's so amazing is that what's kind of sad,
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.720]   besides the suicide, is that he is a rather rare individual
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.520]   in that respect.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.760]   I mean, it'd be one thing to say if there were literally thousands
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.920]   of sports around, but they're not.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.680]   Here's a picture that Doc posted from an O'Reilly conference
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.520]   in 2002 when Aaron was 15.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.800]   That's Dave Weiner in the background.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.960]   It was the same year Doc says I booked him for a panel
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.000]   at Comdex in Las Vegas.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.920]   His mom dropped him off.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.880]   His computer was an old Mac laptop with a broken screen
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.440]   that was so dim I couldn't read it, but he could.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.880]   And he rationalized it as a security precaution.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:31.920]   This was a very smart, very precocious kid.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.320]   And we're very sorry to have lost him.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.440]   So I just wanted to--
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.760]   I thought it was really important that we talk about this.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.200]   You can read a lot more if you just search for Aaron Swartz
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.640]   SWARTC on the internet.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.800]   There's just a ton of stuff out there.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.040]   And it's a sad story.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.160]   We had reported on the Jay Store story several times
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.760]   and talked about it.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.800]   But just for it to end this way, two years to the day,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   by the way, of his arrest.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.840]   So imagine, I mean, after two years--
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.520]   he was facing not 50, 30 years in prison.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.560]   It's not a lot better.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.200]   When you're 26, 30 years in prison, he'd be my age
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.080]   when he got out.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.320]   That's like the worst thing that could happen to a 26.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.720]   I'm being leers-a.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.840]   Oh my god.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.160]   I'm practically dead.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.000]   Let's talk about CES.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.120]   It's almost--
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.160]   It seems so trivial, doesn't it?
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.600]   Speaking of practically dead.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.000]   Do you hate CES?
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.600]   I hate CES while I'm at CES.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.520]   It's a love-hate thing.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.440]   It is.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.280]   And I always say, I'm never going to go back.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.760]   And I go back each and every year.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.320]   I hate it.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.760]   I'm never going back.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   If I didn't have to for work, I would never go again.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.120]   This was-- I think this is--
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.440]   first of all, the economy sucks.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.800]   So the innovation flatlined.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.440]   I mean, the stories that we got out of CES
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.480]   were a potty trainer with an iPad stand.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.920]   Everybody reported on that like that was a big deal.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   The haptic fork.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.520]   Happy fork.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.080]   You know why happy fork got so much coverage?
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.720]   And the reason you covered it, I understand.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.160]   The press is lazy, not us.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.240]   But this was your assignment.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   I said, you're going to the very first CES event, CES Unveiled,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.800]   which apparently had a dearth of products.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   It did have Gallagher, though.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.560]   Gallagher.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:19.920]   Great.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.040]   Smashing watermelons.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.520]   One--
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.920]   The best thing at CES Unveiled was the ice sculpture
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.440]   they had that you could pour martinis.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.040]   And you can't report on that.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.640]   That was about it.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.480]   So Sunday night, every media organization in the world
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.000]   goes to CES Unveiled, hoping because you want to get
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.360]   the lead on everybody jumping on it.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.400]   Now, we assigned this to you.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.760]   You had to do it.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.160]   And there's really only one thing there of any interest at all.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.440]   It's a vibrating fork.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.960]   So you covered it, but it's not just you, the Huffington
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.760]   Post, ABC, NBC.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.200]   It's like the biggest thing that ever happened.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.840]   Why does it vibrate?
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.040]   It vibrates if you eat too quickly.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.400]   So--
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.720]   Which I already vibrate if I eat too quickly.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.360]   So I'm not really sure what that's for.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.840]   The idea is it gives you feedback.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.280]   So yeah, it does all the count.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   It has a Bluetooth connection.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   It's $100.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   It's $100.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   It's $100.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.520]   And you need an iPhone or an Android phone.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.360]   You know, I don't know.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.760]   I kind of disagree with you guys.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.200]   I thought CES this year was really good.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.440]   And I thought there were a lot of interesting things.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:17.920]   What?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.400]   Let me ask you.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.520]   How many CESs have you been to?
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.000]   Seven?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.720]   Oh, well, he has.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   He's got standing.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.000]   This was number 12 for me.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.600]   And I can honestly say I was done at number 10.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.040]   Yeah, I was too.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.280]   And I ran into Leo over at the food court.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.160]   And I said this to Leo.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.240]   I went to the LG, the Panasonic, and the Sharp--
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.760]   oh, no, the Toshiba keynotes.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.320]   And one thing that I noticed about all of them
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.240]   is literally half their news presentations
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.440]   were dedicated to new appliances.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.600]   And refrigerators.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.320]   Refrigerators?
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.760]   Microwave.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.200]   Washing machines.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.640]   New convection, microwave.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.960]   Combination ovens.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.760]   And they were all touting some sort of interactive cross
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.640]   platform with Bluetooth or RFID and your phone.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.760]   It's like, you know, you come up to your washing machine,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.480]   pass your phone over by the detector,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.160]   and it'll tell how to wash your clothes.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.040]   It's like, why don't you just set the dials like you normally
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.320]   do and press start?
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.640]   It's-- they're literally finding excuses
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.840]   to literally drop all this R&D and all this stuff
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.960]   that they've developed that they can't really move anymore
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.040]   because everyone's bought the HDTVs.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.880]   Everyone has a title.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.240]   Everyone has a phone.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.120]   And they're trying to drum up excitement
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.680]   to get consumers buying it.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.760]   And people are like, well, look, I'm tapped out.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.240]   I really don't need it.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.640]   And there's really nothing that special about it.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.360]   I mean, 4K TVs look awesome.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.760]   They're great.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.800]   Not enough content.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.880]   I know their movies coming out and their movies were a shot.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.360]   They were shot in 4K that you can put on it.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.560]   But are you going to really spend $12,000 to upgrade
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.320]   from HDTV right now when the amount of content that is in that?
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   But that's not the point.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.640]   You still have to develop the stuff,
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.680]   even without the content.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.160]   I mean, the content's coming down the line.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.640]   The point about CES is that it's the stuff
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.320]   that you're going to see mainstream in 12, 18, 24 months.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.080]   You can't say that there's no content now.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.920]   So it's not that there's no content.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.240]   I think it's stale content.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.600]   Cover story on The Economist this week.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.240]   It's from Britain.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   It's good.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.040]   The Rodan's famous sculpture, The Thinker,
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   sitting with his hand on this chin, he's sitting on a toilet.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.600]   I disagree.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.880]   The headline, "Will we ever invent anything this useful again?"
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.400]   The growing debate about dwindling innovation.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.600]   Now, I am not going to be like that patent inspector in 1920
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.520]   who said everything's been invented.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.160]   That's obviously not the case.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.440]   But it does feel like we're on a plateau.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.160]   Does it not?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.560]   I think maybe you could get that impression maybe
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.840]   if all you were doing was looking at CES.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.080]   I think one of the great things that comes out of CES
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.640]   this year is that increasingly the big companies
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.080]   that have got really big stuff through it.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   They do their own thing.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   They're doing their own thing.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.640]   But if you look at big picture, think about what's happened
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.440]   in the last year.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.480]   You've got SpaceX blasting off into space.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.040]   You've got Tesla delivering the first, all electrics,
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.600]   sedan.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   You've got all--
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.680]   There's lots of--
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.520]   Incredible amount of innovation.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.080]   Interesting stuff.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.000]   You're going to see, yes.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.200]   Mostly what you're seeing is amazing televisions,
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.120]   some nice tablets, some nice laptops,
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.320]   and some fridges with everything.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.080]   But that's why I almost never covered the Central Hall.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   I stay on purpose, stay away from the Central Hall,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.200]   because that's bigger TVs, bigger appliances,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.880]   internet connected toasters.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.760]   I try to go to the innovation pavilion.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.880]   So I spend a lot of time in the Venetian,
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.080]   a lot of time in the South Hall, where I get to see technologies
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.360]   that are in their raw form, flexible displays,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.440]   and curved displays, and haptic feedback,
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.800]   that could be used for something later on.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.760]   That's where the innovation comes.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.080]   Oh, that's the Qualcomm, isn't it?
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   Keep going.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600]   Keep talking.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.800]   Keep talking.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.600]   I'm just going to undermine you later.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.280]   Go ahead.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.240]   So there are-- there were a few diamonds in the rough.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.960]   The problem is this year, it was a really loud CES.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.680]   And so it was incredibly hard to find it.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.440]   In fact, the two that were pushed above all the noise
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.080]   were the happy fork.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.920]   And--
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.640]   Because it was-- my position is because it was the first thing
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.680]   anybody saw.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.640]   And check journalists now have become like ducklings.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.200]   They got imprinted by the first gadget they saw,
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.560]   and that was the story of CES.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.640]   And the Oculus Rift.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.560]   Yeah, but that's--
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.680]   But that's not-- first of all, it's not out.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.200]   It's a Kickstarter project.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.080]   It's in prototype.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   I'm actually going to get one.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.040]   I donated to it.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.840]   But it's-- and by the way, have we not seen virtual reality
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.240]   advisors for the last 20 years?
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.520]   It's nice, but it's still a little heavy.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.480]   It's still a little bulky.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.360]   And there's still a degree of, you're only
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.680]   going to use us if you're a geek.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.520]   Right.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.880]   I think the reason to go to CES, if you go,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.080]   is to see the TVs.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.000]   Because everything else you can read about online.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.360]   And as you say, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung,
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.160]   all announce their big products at their own events, not at CES.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.520]   But you can't see the TVs this year's--
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.240]   and maybe next year's TV--
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.880]   unless you go to CES.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.480]   And I have to say 4K Ultra HD looks great.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.000]   It looks awesome.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.680]   Even better, Ultra HD OLED.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.040]   Yeah, that's Sony OLED.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.360]   Freaking amazing.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.120]   I can't wait to see that.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.320]   So I have to say, I do believe that there is some stuff there
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.160]   that's innovative and interesting.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.080]   And the price came down.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.400]   I think it was only $14,000.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.560]   Did you see--
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.640]   high sense had a 110-inch Ultra HD display for--
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.880]   oh, no, this is Westinghouse.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   High sense had one, too.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   Westinghouse was only $300,000.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.640]   Oh, it's OK.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.160]   Not bad.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.440]   And you have to take the roof off to get it in the door.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.040]   The best thing I saw at the high sense booth
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.800]   was honestly a--
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   a bad way.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.320]   By the way, we should just say high sense
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.880]   was in Microsoft's booth.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.960]   Oh, this is Microsoft's replacement.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.760]   So the thing they had at their booth
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.640]   was like every hour, like on the hour,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.120]   they'd have a band that Jams playing one go on a didgeridoo,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.840]   a girl on violin, a guy with a steel drum, a guy with bongos,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.680]   and all they would do was run around the booth,
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.240]   like, prawns around the booth, having a jam didgeridoo session.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.160]   It was really obnoxious.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.240]   It was absolutely the--
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.680]   [MUMBLING]
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.520]   Right.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.400]   But I imagine that with a little bit of a--
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.760]   OK, I got to play the video.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.280]   Crazy.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.880]   So instead of Microsoft, is this where the video--
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.240]   I want to find the video, the Qualcomm video.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.840]   Do you have that, Chad?
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.640]   So Microsoft, for the first year in a long time, no keynote,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.720]   was Gates for a long time.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.400]   Then it was Bomber.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.000]   It was the first keynote of CES on Monday night,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.480]   leading off the Tuesday opening.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.520]   This time was Qualcomm.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.640]   I mean, you couldn't pick a company as a prop as it could be.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.200]   We don't have to because the Verge did a great cut down
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.000]   of what has to be the strangest--
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.240]   Bizarre.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:37.740]   I didn't go.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.520]   Did you go?
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.360]   No.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   I'm so sad now.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.280]   I watched the highlights on the--
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.680]   Here's the highlights from the Verge.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.320]   I've got a video.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.160]   I don't know if this is the one.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   It was just watching a train wreck.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   It was so bad you just wanted to stay and see what was--
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.200]   You could play my screen.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.160]   I think this is it.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.000]   Brian Bishop, and I can see through space and time.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.880]   This is 90 seconds in the Verge presented by Ford.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.120]   Last night, Qualcomm gave up--
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.200]   was without question the craziest presentation of CES so far.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.360]   No, this isn't it.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.000]   I want to see--
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   I want to see--
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   --in-house, in-online audience.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:05.840]   This isn't it.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.760]   I got to find it.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.260]   I got to find it.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.800]   Maybe it's on YouTube.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.640]   Because the cut down--
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.160]   Chat's got it.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:10.800]   Chat's got it.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.440]   Chat, you got it.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:11.940]   All right.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.240]   The cut down really brings it all together.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.920]   Yeah, I just have to wait for this ad to--
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.520]   Yeah, the YouTube's got a lot of ads these days.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.240]   Somebody's making money.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:19.760]   I love it.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.720]   I need to make money.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.200]   I don't know if Chat can find it with someone--
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.480]   Gift a bomber running across the stage
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.840]   with a digital cake in front of him.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.880]   It was actually pretty good.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.040]   I have to say, Samsung had Bill Clinton at their keynote.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.200]   That's pretty cool.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.680]   And Samsung, by the way, just because
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.280]   we talked about it the week before,
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.760]   they sent out a very cryptic invitation,
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.200]   a new shape for television sets.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.360]   People were speculating maybe it's portrait, maybe it's see-through.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.480]   Turns out to be a freaking TV on an easel.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.000]   On the easel.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:49.640]   Like a blackboard.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.120]   Here we go.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.080]   This is the CES keynote from Paul Clinton.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.880]   Happy New Year.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   I'm part of a new generation of texting.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.680]   Texting?
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.880]   I was better known by Tornado.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.080]   Tornado 92.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:05.600]   These are actors.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.520]   They just pulled back the world from backstage.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.560]   So he eat a volcano on 53.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.400]   Ooh!
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.680]   They have a sweet job and a hot girlfriend.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.840]   And by hot, I'm in like, Fuego!
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.080]   Fuego?
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.960]   My phone is in my conference room.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.560]   Heads up.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.880]   I met a kid like this with a street I'd punch him in the nose.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.440]   Watch, he's going to go boom.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.400]   Boom.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.320]   Can you dig it?
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.480]   Can we stop doing boom?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.680]   We're born mobile.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.320]   We're born mobile.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.240]   You've got to be mobile if you want to be a top dog.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.240]   Or a top dog.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   Nothing but catch traces.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.520]   Super popular.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.960]   I think there was supposed to be applause there.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.720]   A CEO.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   Oh.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.720]   Oh.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   Oh.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.720]   Oh.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.720]   Microsoft took a major step forward.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.720]   And there he goes.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.640]   Steve Palmer runs by Steve.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.240]   It's like your crazy uncle running.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.160]   Watch this because he tries to interrupt Steve.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:03.880]   In the last month alone, CNN, Sony's Crackles, Tongza, Twitter, Expedia, and Fitbit.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.560]   They also have plenty of puffedington poems.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.120]   You don't stop the bummer.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.200]   Don't get in the way of that train wreck.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.760]   We're working with some amazing people.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.760]   Please welcome.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.760]   Yay.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.960]   Here's Guillermo del Toro.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   Alice Eve.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.600]   What's she in?
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   Is she famous?
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.400]   She's the new star trick.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.240]   Everybody's favorite eight foot feathered friend.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.240]   Big Bird.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   All right.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.800]   Big Bird's followed by.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.960]   A guy in like a creepy big bird.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.880]   It's archbishop Desmond Tutu.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   There's a segue.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.520]   That's just, I know, that was like what?
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.240]   I don't roll his voice.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's the pool.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   Oh, wait.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   But wait a minute.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.600]   Something went wrong and Maroon 5 singing, but Daito is playing.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   Hello.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   Hello.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.600]   We're calling Gen M now, the born mobile generation.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   Born mobile.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   Born mobile.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   Born mobile generation.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   Born mobile.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   She has legs.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   You're born mobile.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.600]   Born mobile.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   Exactly.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   Oh, I mean, it's just absolutely awkward.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   It's so awkward.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.160]   I'm so grateful to the Verge for making that cut down.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:27.640]   It's really bizarre, but it also just shows that a lot of companies have spent a lot of
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.760]   money on honing their PR and kind of their presentation, and Qualcomm clearly hasn't.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   It's--
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.360]   Qualcomm doesn't even sell to end users.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   No.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.360]   It's a B2B brand.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.160]   They just put chips in phones.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   They put chips in phones.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.640]   There's nothing to cover here.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.200]   Tornado, guys, not walking into the shop going, give me a Qualcomm phone.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.640]   I got to have Qualcomm.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   I would warm up.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   So I could boom backstage.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.640]   Boom.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.360]   Sashiro, you know what?
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.360]   If anything--
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   Boom.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.600]   If anything, it's actually a very brilliant press move, because think about it.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.600]   We're all talking about it.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.080]   We've got a loop bomber running and following a cake.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   That's good.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.080]   You know, it's--
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.080]   He had to be chasing something.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.640]   It was like a grey hat and a rabbit.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   There was something going on.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   He was really running.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   Well, to it--
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   I love this, too, with the fingers.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   Look at the fingers.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.360]   Well, to it, 3, 8, you don't stop the bomber.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.400]   You can't stop the bomber.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   Don't stop the bomber.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.960]   He never gets any less creepy.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.880]   No, he's so strange.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.200]   It looks like he should be living in a van by the river.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   Oh, no.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.400]   Uncle Fester, they're calling him in the chat room.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.400]   Gosh, he does.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   [SIGHS]
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   I mean, that was just a weird keynote.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   Just a weird way to test.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   It was.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.000]   And it's the old Microsoft keynote, which is why a bomber is there.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   He did it last year.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.400]   And so they just wanted to kind of hand off--
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   the traditional handoff of the cake from one keynote.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   Yeah, some handoff.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   All right, there's got to be some products.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   Look at all this crap that Father Robert Balliscer.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   I think you mean amazing, because you were--
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   This is amazing.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   Actually, wait, wait, wait.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   Let's take a break.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   When we come back--
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   You've also got a bag of crap.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   Where's the bag of--
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.400]   This is-- so if you ever want to know what happens to CES--
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   Well, we're going to show you what's in the bag coming up.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   There's a tease.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   What's in the bag?
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   It's in the bag.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   Audrey, it's Jay.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   Next, on "Twit."
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   I need a lighter.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   OK, he's going to run off like this.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   So this show brought to you by gazelle.com.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   You know, there are products you might want to buy.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   For instance, maybe you want to trade an iPad 3 for an iPad 4.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   You want to get a new phone.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.400]   Maybe you've got an iPhone 5 and you said,
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   "I'd like to get a Galaxy Note.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   You can get cash for your old gadgets."
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.400]   I know a lot of us just throw these gadgets in a drawer.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   Now, here's my iPhone 5.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   It's in flawless condition.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   And it's $430, gazelle.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   Now, this is a beauty thing.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   This is a hard offer from gazelle,
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   as long as it matches the condition that I specified.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   I have 30 days to cash in on it.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   So I can wait.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   In fact, it's a good idea.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   Go to gazelle.com right now.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   Get quotes for your stuff.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   And maybe you're waiting for the next thing to come out.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   You can get that quote and that quote is good.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   30 days.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   Free shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   And then fast payment.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.400]   They'll send you a check.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   You get a PayPal credit.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   Or I like this, the Amazon gift card,
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.400]   which gives you 5% more when you take that.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   The Amazon, if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon,
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   you might as well do that.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   There, data experts will also wipe the data
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   so you don't have to worry about that.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   iPads, iPhones, Android phones, even Blackberries.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   You know, this is an exercise in futility,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   but I'm just wondering if I can get anything
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   for that AT&T Blackberry curve I have.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   You want to take a guess how much that curve is worth?
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   Five bucks?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.400]   Ten bucks?
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   Let's see.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   It's in flawless shape because I never used it.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   Free of water damage.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   Let's just say, "Hey, that's not bad."
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.400]   I'll take 66 bucks.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   So you throw it in a box.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.400]   They pay the postage.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   In fact, what happens is you get all that stuff together
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   and then you say, "Okay, go."
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   They'll mail you the box and the mailing label and everything
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   so you don't have to pay shipping.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:23.400]   iPads, MacBooks, even Mac Minis, Mac Pros and iMacs.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   I actually now have my new iMac.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   Maybe I should send them the old iMac.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   Gazelle.com.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   They have sent out to date more than $50 million
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   to over 300,000 customers.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   That is a great deal.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   Find out what your iPhone or other devices worth.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   Get some cash to buy the next one or just to pay rent.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   Gazelle.com.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   All right, so you have a bag.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.400]   I have a bag.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   This is the distillment of everything you get from the CES
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   Pressroom.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   Is this a -- you got the over-the-shoulder chat so I can
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.400]   show you -- I can dump out the bag.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   What do you got?
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   We need a poo on TV back then.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.400]   All right, here we go.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you got at the Pressroom.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Let's see.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   Oh, my God.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   So this is a year supply of USB-T's.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   Now, are they all teensy-weensy?
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.400]   No, actually Kingston was giving away 32 gigabyte.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   What?
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   Wow.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   And this one is also a bottle opener.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   I'm not really sure what's on these things.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   We used to come back with reams of paper, so this is probably
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   a better -- at least it's usable.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   And you can reuse them.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   Yes.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   This was the booth that had naked women who would come out
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   every 15 minutes.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   Was that the body painted people?
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   Yep.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   That was really -- I mean, I thought booth babes were bad,
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   but this is ridiculous.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.400]   They were wearing panties, right?
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   Yes.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   I didn't look.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.400]   They had bottoms.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.400]   It was actually in the Twit special coverage, but I don't
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   think it made the final cut.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   I hope not.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   So they were wearing -- because I got -- went there early,
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   and I saw them being painted, and I thought, what the hell is
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   this going to be?
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.400]   And then I later saw a picture.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   They were wearing panties, but nothing else, and they were
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   painted.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   And they would go out every 15 minutes.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   They would go out in the middle of the booth.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   They had this little podium stage type thing.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   And they would just stand there.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   And they would just stand there.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   With a glazed look.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   And there was no one in the booth except for that five-minute
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   presentation.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   And what was this product that you were selling?
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   I don't know.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   No.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   No.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.400]   But I guarantee you it had nothing to do with body painting
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   or naked women.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   No.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.400]   And by the way, the most offensive thing I heard was that
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   they called them fembots.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   So there you go.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   Welcome to 2013.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   You know, for a while, there was a brief period when the whole
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   idea of having attractive naked women or semi-naked women to
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   climb.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   But now it's back in force.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   I volunteered to be painted.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.400]   They did not.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   They did not.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   I think a couple of chunky guys like you and me, it would have
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   evened it out.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   That definitely would have gone some attention to the
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   trades.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   And then people would be going, oh, what are you selling?
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.400]   I don't want to look at that, but what else you got?
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.400]   Yeah, it might be more effective.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   It's certainly less offensive.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   Well, maybe not less offensive.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   The booth anti-babe.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   That's what we need.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.400]   I don't know.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   I think they just cut back on it for a while.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   They cut back on it for a couple of years, just because they
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   didn't have the money to pay for them.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.000]   They couldn't afford them.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.400]   But that's not all there was at CES.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   Was there just a last--
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:26.680]   There was a hashtag as a result, by the way, of not buying it
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   hashtag.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.600]   I was probably started by people who were offended by the
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.400]   booth base, but they said, I'm not buying whatever it is you're
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   selling, because I don't--
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   Oh, that particular booth did.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   Oh, really?
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.400]   That's-- oh, fuck.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   You know, maybe I should plug this in and find it what they
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.400]   were actually saying.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.400]   Yeah, hyper-mac.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   Yep.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.400]   What were they selling?
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   Unbelievable.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.400]   So not buying it, because this is an appropriate way to sell
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.400]   hard drives.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   And then, of course, the picture.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   So you know what we're talking about.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.400]   That's it.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.400]   Oh, hyper-mac.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   I know who hyper-mac is.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.400]   That is nothing to do with what they sell.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   That's ridiculous.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.400]   That's ridiculous.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   And there were quite a few not buying it.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   I was just looking for the angle.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   I was looking for the angle.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   Something that-- a five-mac.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.400]   So again?
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   Roll up a couple.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   A CEA behind hyper-- oh, no, you're supposed to-- oh, yeah.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   That's not good.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   What?
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   Do you humanizing women as a CEO behind hyper-mac?
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   Chin Daniel, are you supportive of dehumanizing women,
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.400]   Backlash.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.400]   It was the weirdest presentation ever, because they didn't smile.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.400]   They didn't move--
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   They're robots.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.400]   Exactly.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   They would do this.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   Like, really?
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   They would do that?
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   They would do that.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   They moved their arms like robots?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   Why don't you just get them in robot suits?
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   I'll tell you one thing that I saw that was not there.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   3D TV.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.400]   Well, there was a little bit of it, but not much.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   No, no, no.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   There was some--
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   LG was stuck because they bought that giant 3D display.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   They had to do that.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   But there weren't a lot of glasses put in the lens.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   Well, there was a lot of headlines.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.400]   Actually, it was 3D dead.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   I saw one from Stream TV over at--
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   It was not just for show stoppers.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   Just for show stoppers.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.400]   Oh, my God.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   That thing gave me a migraine.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   Does it work?
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   It works.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.400]   It gives you a migraine, though.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.400]   It's ridiculous.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   So the idea is you're doing some sort of weird diffraction thing
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.400]   so that you don't have to wear glasses, and you can move.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.400]   It's not lenticular, right?
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   You can shift around.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   The thing is, the image is kind of wavy, kind of like if you have too much to drink.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Oh, great.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.400]   And so--
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.400]   For-- for--
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.400]   Grace was with me.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   And she was sick immediately.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   And it took me about two minutes.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   I was sick for the next 10 minutes.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.400]   I was like, not vertigo, but kind of borderline not just--
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   You're like motion sickness.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   Exactly.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   Well, that's a--
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   That's a successful product.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   And it was like, it's great.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   And then two minutes later, I was like, "Huh, I don't feel so well."
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.400]   What happens if you drink whilst you're watching it?
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.400]   Is that then counteract?
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.400]   Maybe.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   Maybe it's the drunk team.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   I have never seen drunk.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400]   There's never so many USB keys in my life.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   I have a--
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.400]   Dude, dude, is it allowed that you took three from I?
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.400]   No, so you wait till Friday.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   You make friends with the owners actually guarding the USB series.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.400]   Oh, these are the leftovers.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.400]   And you open your bag and you just dump a bunch of stuff.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   So you socially engineered your way into X-T USB drives?
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   Well, these are the keys I will use for the next year.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.400]   These are the hot commodities from CES.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   So what they do--
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   It's the power of Jesus.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   It's the power of Jesus.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.400]   That's what he does.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   The power of Jesus compares you to giving that USB drive.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.400]   The multiplication of the USB drives.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.400]   You see the collar?
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.400]   That's right.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   So the idea is that these are their press kits.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.400]   Correct.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.400]   They don't have to give you press kits.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   They just give you these USB keys with the press kit.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   And you might pursue some of these companies.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   Occasionally you might look at them, but usually you just reformat the thunder at the stick.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   Right.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.400]   Whatever family part of the--
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.400]   What this tells you though is how cheap this stuff is.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.400]   It's great.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.400]   I don't trust these.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.400]   Because it's so cheap.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   It's so easy to put an auto script tool on these things so that when you plug in your computer
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   and just infect-- I wipe them.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.400]   They all wiped.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.400]   How do you-- is there a technique so that-- because you can't really stick them in anywhere.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   I have a little mini ITX computer that I--
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   It's made for that.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.400]   You plug a USB device into it and just wipes it out.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   It's called Father Robert Ballister's free USB key wiper.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.400]   That's right.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   Pagerade the jack.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   So you can just plug it into a Linux box.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   You've got one too.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.400]   I just plug them into the--
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   You've got seven hires.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.400]   Wow.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   Are those going to the--
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.400]   Those are solid metals.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   The donation plate.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   Oh, wait.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   Wait.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   Pagerade the chat room says that rather than fembots you should go next to you with some
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   max troll bots.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   Oh, I like that.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   I will bring them.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   I will be there.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.400]   I will bring them.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   All right.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   I've just sorted these out.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   It's like a--
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   It's like Hot Wheels collection.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   12, 13, 14.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   You've got 28 USB keys.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   There's a couple over there.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   It's 31.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   I may have a lot.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   Wow.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   Power of Twit compels you.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   All right.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   What did you see that was cool?
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   It's fembots.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   Coolest thing I saw.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   It got no press, which is why I like talking about it.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   This thing.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   This is actually--
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   Don't tell us.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   Maybe we can let the people--
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   Let's play a little version with Roger and--
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   Chat room, relax.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   And Will.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.400]   Can you tell us what is this?
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   Now, I'll give you a hand.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   It's got a screen on the front.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   It's got little metal thing clips on the side.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   I don't want to hide any information that's written on the back.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   It looks like a fan.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   It looks like a fan.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   It looks like one of these things that you like--
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   Like an air freshener thing that you--
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   It's an air freshener.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.400]   I thought it might be a USB speaker.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   We saw about eight--
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   Yeah, it was a lot of blue speakers.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   We saw about 800 blue speakers.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   It looks like a cooler that's powered through USB.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   Look at that.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   I think Jeff N. got it right.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   He says it's a fuel cell.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   There we go.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   Very, very little--
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.400]   So air goes in here and it gives you power.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   Well, OK, so we've got these.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   These are cartridges which have--
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   It's like sodium polysylicate.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   It's basically a bunch of crystals.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.400]   They call it power trek.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   Power treks.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   And what you do is you have this.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.400]   There's a little water reservoir.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.400]   So I have that filled up with water.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.400]   This is a fresh cartridge.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   That one's expended.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   You put this in like that.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   Take this.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   Take this case.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.400]   This has the proton exchange membrane in it.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   Sorry.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.400]   Sorry.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.400]   What?
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   The proton exchange membrane.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   I might just move this one.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   Now what's happening is it's pumped a little bit of that water
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   into the canister and it's now feeding hydrogen into this.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   And if it's working properly, it'll charge up a phone.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   I should be able to plug in my phone.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   Did you put water in there?
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   Would you want some whiskey?
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.400]   Would that make it work better?
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.400]   It'll work drunk.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   And?
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   I just do this.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.400]   So activate it.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.400]   Make sure it's getting hydrogen.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.400]   And I don't have to be--
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   So the air is--
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.400]   Yeah, now it's charging.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.400]   Is it a chemical reaction from the air or from the water?
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.400]   From the water.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   So the water's the fuel.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.400]   It's actually splitting.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   It's liberating the hydrogen from the water.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.400]   And then burning it?
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.400]   And then it goes-- well, it doesn't burn it.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   It goes into the proton exchange membrane.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   What you get out is water vapor and power.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   We've seen these before that use air.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.400]   Right.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.400]   So how much power do you get from one of these?
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   You get four hours of power from each one of those pucks.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   And a puck costs?
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   A puck costs $2.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.400]   Now here's the beauty part.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   After the puck has been used up, and this one's used up, right?
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   Right.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   So I can open it up?
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.400]   Well, it's sealed.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   We'd have to get burped to open it up.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.400]   But you can use what's left over as toothpaste.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.400]   Right.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   Or shoe polish.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   Or shoe polish.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.400]   Or shoe polish.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.400]   Wait, are those things interchangeable?
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.400]   Or flex?
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.400]   Or wax.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   If I've been cleaning my shoes with the wrong thing.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   How do you open it up?
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   Well, you'd have to get pliers to pop it up.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   So it's not intended to be like the horrible toothpaste.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   It's not a toothpaste.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   It's not a toothpaste.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   It's not a little squeezy thing.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.400]   I wonder if they denature it.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.400]   What does it taste like?
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   Did you try it?
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   Yeah, actually I did.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.400]   It's...
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.400]   No, because...
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.400]   Hey, Burke, can you open this up?
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.400]   Is Burke here?
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   Can you open this up?
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.400]   I want to try whatever this is.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.400]   I don't think he works on Sunday.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.400]   But they did pitch this, right?
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   This is a usable side effect.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   John, do we have any pliers?
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   Here he comes.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   John's called the pliers.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   Oh, you wind up.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   What is it made out of?
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   It's sodium polysylicate.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   It's the abrasive element for toothpaste.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   Oh, well, it's not toothpaste.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   It's something that's in toothpaste.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   Well, because you add flavoring into toothpaste so people don't gag when they...
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.400]   Are they promoting the idea that you might want to use this later?
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.400]   Can we open this?
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.400]   Yeah, sure.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.400]   I should ask you before.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.400]   You might want to be using this for...
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.400]   He's inching away.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   It just creates hydrogen.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   I mean, that's just explosive.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.400]   Oh.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   No, no, no, just kidding.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.400]   It's flammable.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.400]   It's flammable.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.400]   That's right.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.400]   It just burns quickly.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.400]   It's fine.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.400]   We haven't got anything that could say anything alive.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   I mean, oxygen.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   But the other cool thing about this is it's an unlimited shelf life.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.400]   So you could get a bunch of these pucks and they'll sit on the shelf forever until you need them.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.400]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.400]   Until the end of the world.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.400]   Until the zombie apocalypse.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   And so you need no power.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.400]   It creates power from pure plain old water.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   Right.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   It's a company called MyFC, My Fuel Cell.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.400]   We've seen fuel cells a variety of fuel cells before.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.400]   I used to have a hearing aid battery.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.720]   No, I mean, there's been a company called Horizon that's been making fuel cells for a while.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.800]   But this is actually portable and affordable.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:56.080]   The units about 200 to 229, which that's pricey, but still for a fuel cell, that's cheap.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.360]   And the pucks are two to four dollars each, depending on how much capacity you want out
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.360]   of them.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.000]   And each one of these could power up your phone.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.840]   It could power up your lighting.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.080]   If you have emergency LED lighting, your GPS device, they sell it as a sort of a ruggedized
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.080]   outdoor device.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.400]   So camping, that's a, you know, like an emergency thing.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.560]   Safe for aircraft cabins, it says.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.520]   I actually brought this on the bike.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.040]   Whatever, make me nervous.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   They gave me two of them.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.480]   The other one is currently on its way to Seattle, I think, because Delta doesn't like
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   me.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   All right.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   What else did you see of interest?
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.080]   Well, this actually were a lot of headphones.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080]   Yes.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   Oh, celebrity headphones.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   Celebrity.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   Is that all because of Dr. Dre?
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   Is that?
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080]   Can we blame beats for this?
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.520]   I think the mistake of going into the Monster Press event.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   And I have never seen, we're probably never going to get products from them again, I've
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.840]   never seen so much shown with low, with, with absolutely no new technical, you know,
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   advancements.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   And fun.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.600]   It's literally all they did was announce new partnerships.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:06.200]   So they had exhibit, Nick Cannon, Sheila E, Sugar Ray Leonard, all on stage kind of talking
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.600]   about these new headphones.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.680]   And they were, it was funny because I think Sugar Ray wanted to leave as quickly as possible.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.240]   But you could just, it's like, why am I standing here?
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.600]   It's just a bunch of models with like fake rhinestone headphones, prancing around the
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   room.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.880]   I don't want to get sodium silicate all over everything.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.320]   It might, it might, well, don't get them on the thumb drives.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   They could still be useful.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.560]   Yeah, I, the whole celebrity headphone thing is, is very strange.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.240]   And it's, I think it, it says a lot about CES.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.400]   That really CES is about marketing.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.080]   It's about, you know, BS.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.760]   It's not about innovation in any way really.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.840]   It's about, it's about making something attractive enough that Best Buy or whatever electronic
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840]   store is going to get.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840]   Okay.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840]   But let's think about the stuff that was good.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.240]   Did you guys see the steam box?
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   Yes.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.600]   I went to, I went to, this is exciting.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.840]   This is just three I.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   No, the X, the X-I three.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.440]   So that's the company or that's the.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.080]   They've been making these beautiful little mini ITX cases for a while.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.880]   They've been, now this is the thing.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.960]   They will neither confirm nor deny that they have anything to do with the new steam box
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.680]   because of contractual obligations.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680]   Okay.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.920]   But I mean, you can kind of put two and two together.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.560]   But what's so great about it, if you actually haven't seen these things, they're super tiny.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.560]   Beautiful.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.560]   They're, they're about, oh wait, yeah, you have one on screen.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.280]   They are powered by AMD, chipped with embedded GPUs on the core.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.360]   Yeah, I looked, I priced one out just to see about a thousand bucks.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.520]   Is the AMD processors okay in here?
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.280]   Well, that's, that's the big question mark because AMD has traditionally trailed Intel
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.360]   when it's come to out and out performance.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.960]   But one of the things that X-I three was touting was because, you know, it's literally
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.000]   GPU on die and the rest of the, the power usage is so low.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.560]   He was on one of the lower, lower usage models of their entry level unit was about, think
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.080]   13, no 14 watts.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.080]   And then 18 at max.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.040]   They have a Athlon 2000 plus version with eight watts of power use.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.640]   The long 2000 plus.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.320]   The 3400E is 22 watts.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.080]   Lord, that is old school.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.360]   Yeah, it's pretty old, isn't it?
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.240]   So I mean, the, the exciting thing is that whatever this steam box ends up being, valve
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.840]   is trying to develop, you know, basically, you know, steam has become sort of ubiquitous
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.400]   as PC development platform, trying to put that on a little box underneath your TV in
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.360]   the same way that an Xbox or a PlayStation.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.920]   I've been very excited about this for a couple of weeks because I've been playing with
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   the steam.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   What do they call it?
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   Big picture.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   Big, big, big.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920]   It looks great.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.440]   It's a, it's an easy to use, you know, big TV interface.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.200]   But what you'd get is PC games and in theory, for roughly the price of a PS three or an
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.360]   Xbox 360, you'd get PC gaming via steam on your big screen TV.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.760]   And what they're saying is that the, the, the valve software for the new, for the new,
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.000]   whatever it is they develop will actually come on a box that's powerful enough to power
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.600]   multiple screens.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   So you could have multiple player gaming.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:10.720]   No, this, this one was shown with two, uh, uh, wouldn't try that.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   Was three video outputs.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.320]   One, each of them, I think the other one, a digital.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.160]   But really, I don't know how much that is going to be a driver.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.200]   It's the idea that I get a three or $400 box, put it in my living room, HDMI it into my
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.280]   big screen TV, comes with a controller, sit back and play the best quality games.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.320]   Because frankly, console gaming is a little bit stuck in the doldrums because it's been
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.560]   so long since the last update.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.480]   And I think what's so great about it is now you actually do have a very compelling home
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.240]   theater PC device, something that isn't ungainly or awkward deployed.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.720]   This is, these are beautiful.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.960]   They're really small and they're very innocuous.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.760]   I mean, you could literally stay, even if you say you lived in a smallish apartment, you
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.400]   could put one near your HTTP and you could run all your media through it.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.200]   They've got a visa, they've got a visa mounting bracket for it.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.240]   So you could actually mount it on the back of a monitor and you'd never see it.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.800]   So having said that I thought it was really exciting idea, I'm actually, I think it's
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   interesting.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   I think it's innovative.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   I think it's completely useless.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   What?
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.720]   Which is, which is that I just don't see the, if the last decade of home theater PC building
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.760]   is towards anything, is that nobody really cares about building home.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   You're right.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.360]   They like Xboxes, they like PS3.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.160]   Look at the Windows media center.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.120]   There's been killed off in Windows 8.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.200]   The Windows Home Theater PC server thing that sat and served.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.400]   But those were media centers not gaming devices.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   Xbox done fine.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   Playstations are fine.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.520]   But the great thing about gaming on Xbox or PlayStation 3 is that it's one thing you
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.520]   pick a desk, you know it's going to work.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.040]   Steam is already talking about having three tiers of hardware to the level.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.200]   And you're introducing a level of complexity that you just don't need.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   So what's the thing?
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.960]   And yeah, this is all downloaded.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.880]   The nice thing about Steam you buy it, you can play it on your PC and you can play it
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.880]   on your home.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   It's a tight jerk, huh?
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   You're your device.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.200]   I've already bought a lot of games by it.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.520]   I mean, I love Steam and I think yeah, it's a big, I don't know how many members of Steam
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.720]   has, but that's a big player in the PC market.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.440]   Bringing it to the home theater might be a different.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.720]   And you know, it's interesting because they weren't the only ones announcing any kind of
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   a Steam partnership.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.480]   I mean, Nvidia, if you went to Nvidia Press Conference, they unveiled Project Shield,
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:20.760]   which was basically an Android handheld gaming device powered by the new Tegra 4 chip.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.200]   Now yeah, Ho-hum, Android gaming neither here nor there.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.960]   But what was interesting is that they showed off a functionality that allowed you to stream
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:35.040]   from your gaming PC through device to your TV using the controller, Steam big picture.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.640]   So any game that would run off your gaming PC, whether it requires the GPU, whatever,
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.120]   could be streamed like on Live does or did.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.120]   Right.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.440]   Yeah, look how well that worked out.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.720]   Well, but this is locally.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.920]   This is over your home network.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.320]   So you don't need to move your gaming PC anywhere.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.520]   As long as it's plugged into the network, you can run it to your TV no matter where it's
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.520]   at.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.600]   I think that was actually the big story in gaming and it was really centered around the
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.840]   Nvidia booth and the Nvidia grid.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:07.280]   It's a concept that we've been using in Enterprise for a while, the idea of massively
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.360]   distributed power.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.760]   You could have these huge racks of servers.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.360]   In their case, they're using the GPUs to do a lot of calculations incredibly quickly.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.160]   And rather than having games for this platform and games for that platform, you have the
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.160]   game which can then be run to basically any device you have, which I think it kind of
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:30.600]   takes away the importance from really powerful miniature computers when I can now have a
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.840]   tablet or a desktop or a laptop or a Chromebook all have the same gaming experience because
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.000]   all the hard processing is being done upstream somewhere.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.640]   Yeah, I mean, the biggest obstacle has always been latency, right?
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   Connectivity.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.160]   When you do something on the controller, you don't want it to wait even a couple of milliseconds.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.640]   You want it to kill our life.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   I believe.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.920]   But that's what I think what you're talking about being able to do that within your own
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.080]   network.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.840]   So you've got the grid for when you have access to the internet.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.280]   But if you're only within your house, you can use the exact same technology, the exact
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:07.600]   same licensing to run a really high performance game off your PC, but on your television.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.320]   I don't know that people, I mean, again, I'm coming back.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:17.280]   One of my other themes of CES is like the increasing DPCification of PCs and IT and technology,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.280]   right?
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   Right.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   We've seen last quarter.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.840]   I think there was an MPD thing came out last week, which is the first holiday quarter
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.560]   that PC cells have declined.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560]   And we're seeing people buying tablets.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   I think you've got to blame Windows 8.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.960]   People buying tablets, people buying IPOL, you know, people buying stuff to do their computing
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.600]   on that are not PCs.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.280]   And the idea of streaming something from a PC to another device implies that you have
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   the PC in the first place.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.440]   And I think looking out, you know, 18, 24, 36, 48 months, we're just going to see PC cells
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.320]   continue to know the name in favor of tablets.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.800]   I mean, you know, if you think about the, the, the beginning of that was essentially when
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.400]   people started picking up laptops over desktop PCs.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.880]   Because it's a turn key solution.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.120]   Your display is connected.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.320]   You don't need to plug anything.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.680]   It's convenience over power.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   Exactly.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.520]   And, you know, it's, I think it's like home networking.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:11.440]   A lot of devices have become DPCified if that's a correct term and becoming more appliances.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.040]   So why couldn't you have what used to take up a huge server case and just put into a
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.400]   giant box that just stick in the corner, plug in one cord for power, you know, wirelessly
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.280]   connect and have it do the same thing.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.400]   Dr. Morbius in the chat room says, well, you can't play half life three on my pad, though,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   can you?
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.720]   Of course, you can't play half life three on anything.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.800]   Well, actually you could be waiting for that.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.400]   You could play half life three if the processing was not being done locally.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.720]   Well, you know, well, that was the online premise on live premise and I think that that's
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.080]   I never bought it.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.440]   I never debunked by now.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440]   I know.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.840]   No, no, I actually having used online.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.840]   It wasn't a bad experience.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840]   You buying the hype?
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.840]   What?
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   I used it.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.840]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.200]   Even a millisecond or two is too much, right?
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:59.680]   The thing that I think really kind of stuck struck online was just they couldn't carry
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.540]   any kind of first-tier games.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:06.000]   They carried games that were out six months after they've been reased on everything.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   Also, why would you?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.720]   I could run a game for Xbox or PS3 or Wii or Wii U off Gamefly, get in the mail, finish
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.520]   it up in a month, and then send it back.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:20.320]   There were also issues of the economy of these servers side because you build these.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.880]   You have to build up enough server capacity to handle a huge crowd and they said they
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.760]   never had more than 1,500 people using it.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.960]   What killed them was scale.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   It couldn't scale.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.680]   Because they had to build out their own infrastructure.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.680]   But here's the difference.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.840]   Here's the difference between when online started and right now.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.560]   And that is I can actually buy computing power from a colosome.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560]   Right.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.560]   I don't have to build anything.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.560]   Or for me.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.200]   And I can do it on demand.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.520]   I can say, well, I'm going to have from this much to this much needed at any time of the
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.240]   day and you're only going to charge more.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.480]   And it sounds elastic computing and then of course Microsoft and Raxby's and others are
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   doing this too.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.280]   Really does change the equation.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.920]   It's computing power on demand.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.000]   I don't know why online didn't use that.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Because the latency.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.480]   Because Amazon was too far away.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.280]   Because Amazon's software stack is going to be configured delivering web services, not
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.040]   gaming and the whole latency equation is clearly an optimized for latency.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.640]   But imagine if you lived in one of Google's super high bandwidth cities like Kansas City,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.880]   where suddenly you have a super fast connection and access to Raxx and Raxx.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.

[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.

[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880]   And you have a very high bandwidth system.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   Maybe I misspoke.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   I think it does.

[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   Promo code TWIT.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   Very easy to throw a meeting.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   Hold a meeting.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   Very easy to join a meeting.

[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   You have a good TWIT for 30 days.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   Free.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   The difference is you're downloading a job app.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   I mean, Minecraft uses Java.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   But that's fine because you're using an app that you've downloaded and you're going to run it in its Java.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.880]   What the problem is, and what the Department of Homeland Security is warning people about,
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.880]   is Java in your browser.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   Apparently another zero day exploit in Java 7, the latest version of Java,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.880]   that means that a hacker can take over your system.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   You sure DHS isn't just worried about the vast amount of manhouse being wasted in Minecraft.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   It could be.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   It could be.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   They say, this is great.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.880]   They say not to uninstall it, but merely to go into your browser.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   And we've been, Steve gives him to say this on security now for ages and disable browser Java.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.880]   Now, the good news is if you're using Chrome or Safari at least,
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   I don't know how Firefox and IE do it, it will say before it runs Java, it will say,
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   "Hey, this site wants to run Java on your machine.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   Is that okay?"
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   And you have to say, "Allow, explicitly."
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.880]   Of course, a lot of people probably just go, "Yeah, yeah, whatever."
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   "I know whatever."
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   Sure, go ahead.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:34.880]   But there's a weakness in Java 7 that could allow the installation of arbitrary software on a machine.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   The DHS says there's attacks happening right now in the wild,
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   and they're advising you to disable Java in your browser.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   It's kind of complicated to do in Google Chrome, but the good news is,
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.880]   in Chrome, it warns you anyway.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   So I guess the advice to our viewers who are smart and sophisticated is
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   when you get warned that Java is about to run, you might want to think about what from whom and why.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   And if you're playing Minecraft, that's okay.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.880]   If you're doing good at meeting, that's okay, but you might not want to do it on hacker.com.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.880]   (laughter)
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   And all those guys are hack-a-talk.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   Yeah, they're always on there.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   Yeah, they're bad.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.880]   And I don't, Internet Explorer, I think, does not warn you too much about what's going on.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.880]   And Oracle's response says, "Yeah, we're going to update Java."
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   When we feel like it.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.880]   Alex Jones says this is overreaction.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.880]   (laughter)
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   The king of overreaction.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.880]   Is that the same Alex J-pismorgon Alex J-pismorgon Alex J-pismorgon Alex J-pismorgon Alex J-pismorgon.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   The king of overreaction says...
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880]   This is overreaction.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880]   This is overreaction.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   Wow.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   Well, I definitely take that guy seriously.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.880]   (laughter)
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880]   Yeah, I...
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.880]   Homeland Security actually is getting more and more involved in cyber security.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.880]   This is not the first time they've given us a warning about things not to do.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.880]   There's also updates for Flash and Adobe Reader.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   Problems there as well.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.880]   You know, you just turn all that crap off.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   Yes.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.880]   I would think DHS should be more worried about Eric Schmidt going to North Korea.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   I mean, what is that about?
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880]   That's like Jane Fonda riding in a tank.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.880]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880]   (laughter)
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.880]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.880]   So it was a humanitarian mission.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.880]   He's not letting aid and comfort to the enemy.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.880]   No.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   I just think it was a bit...
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.880]   It just looked a bit strange, didn't it?
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   Certainly the US government was very unhappy about it.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.880]   I mean, what was he...
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.880]   What did he officially announce his intention?
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.880]   So, Google, the headline in the WSJ is, "Google Schmidt presses North Korea on web barriers."
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.880]   He told North Korean officials...
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   That's gonna work.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   It must drop barriers to global internet access.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   Kim Jong-Tear this wall down!
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   (laughter)
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   Actually, it's Kim Jong-un.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   Kim Jong-un.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   Uh-oh.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   Kim Jong-un.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.880]   Uh, Tear this...
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:05.880]   Well, you know what? To be honest, North Korea, I think, has a lot more pressing issues than usual access at this point in the middle.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   In a country, most of the people don't have power the full day.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.880]   I think internet access might be kind of low on the priority list.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   Also, I'm just gonna say that he wore the most bizarre sweater I've ever seen a man wear.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   Okay, don't go to Korea in a sweater vest.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   Get in Korea.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   I mean, it's just...
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.880]   It's pink.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   Obnoxious.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.880]   Maybe...
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:24.880]   Susan V. Coleman?
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.880]   There's really no excuse for that sweater.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   It's just press cancer awareness.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.880]   No, no, no.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   You are such a sad man.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   That's outrageous.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.880]   (laughter)
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.880]   Um...
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   Yeah, I don't...
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.880]   I like the spread color.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   That's very British, but I don't understand the pink sweater.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.880]   And it really is pink.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   Sam, it's not even similar.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.880]   And so it's very bizarre sort of two-pronged attack where he brings Bill Rich...
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.880]   Well known for his work in North Korea.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   Um...
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   To say that Pyongyang should temper its nuclear development efforts and advance internet development efforts.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.880]   I think it's reasonable for the State Department to say, you know, we don't think private citizens should be wandering to North Korea.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.880]   (laughter)
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.880]   And asking them to, you know, stop doing anything.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:13.880]   You probably don't want to be responsible for rescuing him somehow in like a month.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880]   There's a picture.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   I don't know.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880]   Is that Richardson?
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.880]   That is strange.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   We know it's interesting that he should say that.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   He looks like he should be running across the stage with llamas.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880]   Chasing a cake.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.880]   Keith in the chat room says just to keep him away from I'm a dinner jacket, which is a flip throwback for many moons ago.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880]   Oh my gosh.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.880]   Well, he totally looks lost.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.880]   It's like grandma.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.880]   (laughter)
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.880]   I got on a bus for Vegas.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.880]   I ended up here.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   By the way, Google implied that Schmidt's not doing this on our time there, and they're dying either.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.880]   He just got bored.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.880]   Wait, is that a public disavowal of Erichment from Google?
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   It's like, well, you know, we don't know.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   He's there.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:50.880]   (laughter)
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.880]   Who knows what Erich does?
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   Maybe they decided to put a new, a node out there somewhere in the interland.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.880]   Gee, he's that guy.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   He's always been kind of a character.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.880]   Maybe he wants to have Google Glasses manufactured in North Korea.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   I have very competitive labor rates.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   (laughter)
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.880]   By the way, I am still waiting for my Google Glasses.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   Yeah, we am number 737.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   I don't know.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.880]   We're supposedly, what, the Pebble Watch is coming out.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880]   I'm going to get mine in a couple of weeks.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.880]   Pebble Watch, the IM Watch, they were both at CES.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   I had the IM Watch terrible.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   It was horrible.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   Couldn't figure out how to use it.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   Oh, they had a press conference at CES.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   And they told the journalists, if you come to the press conference, we will give you an IM Watch.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   And so it packed the room.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880]   It was one of those.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   It was supposed to be 15 minutes.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880]   It went an hour and 15.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.880]   Nice.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880]   And then they told everyone, "Well, we don't have the watches here.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   You all have to come to the booth and we're going to do a sit down with you and guide you through all the features and how you should review it."
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.880]   And so half the people just took us.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.880]   I reviewed it and not was not impressed at all.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.880]   It was very difficult to connect to the phone.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.880]   And you know, the only nice thing about the Pebble Watch is it is e-ink.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   So even if it doesn't work, it will be an interesting watch.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.880]   It's like that sundial watch that was so popular.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   Right.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   I still don't, although I...
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.880]   January 23rd.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.880]   I look at it and it looks lovely.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   I don't get how much, like, the whole idea of it pinging you when you've got like a new email or something.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.880]   Is it more work to like roll your sleeve up and look at your watch than it is just to pull your phone out of your pocket?
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.880]   No.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.880]   I don't see it as a time saver.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.880]   And I saw somebody saying, "It's not a time saver.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   It's a fashion statement."
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.880]   I see it really a fashion statement.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.880]   It is the most fun and kickstarter project of all time.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.880]   More than $10 million in pledges surpassing its initial goal over a hundred times.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.880]   People obviously want it, right?
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.880]   But I just don't get why.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   Well, it's programmable.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.880]   It's cool.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.880]   It doesn't need to have a reason.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.880]   That is absolutely true.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   Sometimes I wonder, you know, everybody, Apple, pretty clearly, certainly Google,
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.880]   Pebble is starting to think about wearable computing, right?
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:02.880]   Google with glasses.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.880]   I bet you Apple is going to do something next year.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880]   What would they do?
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.880]   Well, you know, they took that nano off.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.880]   I think they're going to make another watch.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.880]   Making that a watch.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.880]   Because they need a new product category.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.880]   They need somewhere to grow.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.880]   They're done with the hypergrowth.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.880]   Yeah, that's going to really shut up the critics about having no innovation.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880]   Hey, we got a watch.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   I think, okay, I'll tell you what the next Apple product should be.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.880]   I know it should be an iPhone and iPad mini.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.880]   I'm tired of these little tiny phones.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   I want a Galaxy phone.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880]   Are you on a tablet?
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.880]   You want a note too.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   I want an iPhone in a mini.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   Because then I look at your one device.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.880]   The mini's a nice small enough for a tablet.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.880]   Maybe it's a little bigger than an average phone.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.880]   Hello?
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:47.880]   No, you don't do that, though.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.880]   Nobody really talks on a phone anymore.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.880]   Do you?
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   I talk on my phone all the time.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   What kind of phone do you have?
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:53.880]   iPhone 5.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.880]   Yeah, because I have the Galaxy Note 2.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   It looks kind of dorky if you talk on their phone.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   You know, a year ago at CES, when they released the note, every member of the tech press was
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   like, "Oh, it's too big.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880]   No one ever liked it."
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.880]   Now everyone wants it.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.880]   Is that 4?
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.880]   5.5.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   That's 5.5 because there were quite a lot of 5.5s at the computer.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   That's the hot category.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   It's a Lenovo.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   Right.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   1080p, which is the new hot category of phone.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   Yeah, but I'm telling you, I've had many.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880]   Apple's going to do it this year.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   I've had many with an iPhone in it, and everybody's going to go, "Brilliant idea.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   I just want you to remember."
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   You heard it here.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.880]   The same guy who came up with Dig 4.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   iPad mini phone.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.880]   And they're slogan to be iPad phone home.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880]   I'm not kidding.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880]   You watch.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:46.880]   Ken from Chicago mentioned that Huawei had a 6-inch phone, and yes they did, but also I'd
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.880]   have a great picture of this.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   They were asked by their booth for about two days on that huge screen.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   They had their version of Windows, and it had an error dialog box.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.880]   I guess that no one had access to the room where you had to clear the air.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.880]   It was an all in Mandarin.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.880]   I couldn't read it.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   But right in the center, it looked like that OK dialog box.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880]   Oh my God.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880]   Little sad.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   You're a box at the party.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   Yeah, that's not impressive.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   I like the Chatsco.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]   The Windows 95 now.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.880]   It's good.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:15.880]   We're booting it up.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.880]   It can take a while.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   It'll be booted up by the end of the show.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   I'm sure.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   Oh, I have the connector that you're going to want Leo.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]   What's that?
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   So this is from Energy.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   Energy, I like Energy stuff.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   They make batteries that you can charge your phones with instead.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   This is a 6.8 milliamp hour battery.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.880]   So this could charge your iPhone four and a half times over.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.880]   Cool.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   It can charge up to two iPads at the same time.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880]   All right.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880]   10 watts.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880]   Wow.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   But it also has this.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:44.880]   This is a little cable that they created that each breakout has a different connector.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:46.880]   And so they're going to put the lightning on it.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.880]   You know what connector it doesn't have on it?
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   The lightning.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   Yeah, you know why?
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   They said they're going to do it.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.880]   They're going to do it.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.880]   Yeah, actually.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.880]   I think Dicty Bartolo mentioned this on the Gizwiz.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.880]   So the idea is you've got a 30 pin cable.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.380]   You've got micro USB and you've got mini USB all on this single cable, which is kind of
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.880]   a cool idea.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.480]   But the problem is, and Apple really kind of screwed everybody on this lightning and lightning
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.640]   is proprietary, expensive because it has a protection chip built into it.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   And so far they've kind of shown some reluctance to license it.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.840]   There was a Kickstarter project of a all-in-one battery that had a lightning on it or didn't
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.280]   have it, but they wanted to.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.800]   Apple at first said no, and apparently they've backtracked on that.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.800]   So maybe.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.800]   But it's nice.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   It's neat.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800]   It's clean.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.640]   It's three connectors front to back, almost like a digital centipede.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640]   This is what we've come to.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.000]   This is like the hot product of CES.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.200]   It's the most unassuming that tends to be the most successful.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   Maybe.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.200]   Maybe.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.200]   Yeah, I have to say for me, the thing about looking at all these kind of things and thinking
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:55.200]   about the Lenovo and new categories of note and things is that this year, for me, CES
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.080]   really felt like the first year that other consumer electronics companies really caught
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.080]   up to Apple.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.720]   I seem to remember last year's CES really being lots of also Rand tablets, like lots
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.720]   and lots.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720]   Everyone scrambling after the iPhone.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.160]   Three or four years, the big story at CES was always Apple.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   Apple somewhere else.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   They're releasing an iPad.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.240]   They're releasing the iPhone 4, iPhone 5.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.840]   And that was always the talk of CES, not this year.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.840]   Nobody talked about Apple.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.440]   But this year it actually feels like some, you know, some, just looking at Padre's new
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.000]   Acer notebook, which is gorgeous.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   That's a pretty notebook.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   I mean, it's absolutely gorgeous.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.440]   Yeah, because it's a MacBook Air clone.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.280]   But lots of people don't map a picture on your glass and they've not been any good.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.720]   Whereas this is not only a MacBook Air clone, but has the touchscreen on it as well, which
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.720]   I didn't think I was going to like, but actually I really do.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.720]   I do like the idea of touch.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.280]   I think that Apple should be doing it.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.680]   But I have to say, I'm not saying Apple is still the king of the hill.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.760]   I think there's not much innovation coming out of them either.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.560]   I think we're just in this stagnant period.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.560]   We're in this stagnant period.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.440]   There needs to be another, I mean, you know, innovation never is a linear line.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440]   Right.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.440]   It goes to space.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.440]   You get flat toes.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   I mean, there needs to be another one thing.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   I think that's where we sit.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.040]   A new spark kicks off another round.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.640]   Yeah, I think that's right now.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.800]   Well, I mean, you look at something like Lenovo.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.440]   Lenovo had the horizon, which is that 27 inch.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.080]   That thing is hablin.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   Pretty sweet.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   It's a tablet.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.080]   It's a tablet.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.080]   It's 27 inches.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.080]   What's a PC?
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080]   So it's more than a tablet.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.000]   Yeah, it's a PC, but it's battery powered, but it comes on a cart and it's obviously designed
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   to be used like a tablet.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   What's that?
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.560]   Who wants it, but maybe someone does.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560]   If you can.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:30.360]   Exactly what they said at the board meeting when the guy.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   But maybe.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.840]   Well, Panasonic had a 20 inch, a 20 inch tablet.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.840]   There was 4K.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:38.840]   4K.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:39.840]   I heard about that.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:40.840]   I didn't see it.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.840]   Did you see it?
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.840]   On desktop.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:43.840]   Look gorgeous.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.920]   See, one of the things a lot of people have said, they poo-pooed the idea of 4K because
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.760]   they say, oh, no, you need a giant screen to see the difference or you need to sit very
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.760]   close.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   And I disagree.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:57.160]   I think surprisingly, and you'd only know when you see it, 4K even on a small screen
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.600]   actually is noticeably different.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.600]   I'm not sure why you did.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.320]   It's not like your eyes are just like having a rest in there.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320]   You're on your iPad.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.320]   I think it makes a difference.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.320]   You took that same approach.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.320]   You would never have a high resolution iPad.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.920]   Well, even a 33 or 42 inch screen looks good in 4K.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.080]   And a bigger screen looks even better.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.880]   They had an 8K display.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.040]   That made me a little queasy.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.880]   Did you see, I think it was a Sony's booth.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.880]   And did I?
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.120]   It was a, you were looking at a train first from the top down a switching yard and then
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.320]   the close up.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.960]   And it was, it was, oh, it was too real.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   Wow.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960]   It was really.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   You didn't see that.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   It's incredibly real.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.840]   That part of the Ultra HD spec is both 4 and 8K.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.480]   So I, and I also asked people about whether we're going to get content in 4K.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.520]   And a lot of people I was surprised said, yeah, no, don't worry about it.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.520]   There will be.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.880]   And Netflix did a 4K streaming demo that they did, I think, was sharper LG.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   No, really.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   Wow.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   And I don't know who has that bandwidth yet.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.680]   I was going to say you're going to run through your bandwidth cap in about half a minute.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.680]   In a minute.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.240]   Which is why you need Corning's new advancement, which is all fiber.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:58.240]   Gorilla Glass 3.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.280]   Well, it's, it's using Gorilla Glass technology.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.160]   It's deep, it's deep ion exchange fiber.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.000]   So you could loop it, you can tie it in a knot.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   Wow.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.640]   So you can actually use it in a consumer environment.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   That's cool.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.800]   It's got a crazy amount of bandwidth.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800]   That's cool.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.800]   So maybe we'll just all go fiber.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.800]   Go all fiber.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.800]   Wow.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.160]   Maybe we'll just replace windows with each, you know, 4K, K displays.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.560]   We don't have to look at the window.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.560]   They had that at the higher.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.560]   Oh, it's raining.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.560]   I want to look at something prettier.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.420]   They had a window that had a display that would just come in.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.640]   It looks very real, does it not?
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   Lots of TVs Egon wants the 64K screen.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.800]   Let's start messing around.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.120]   I think, you know, somebody's put in the chat room earlier that CS is sort of fast becoming
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.000]   the conceptual electronica, which I actually agree with.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   I don't mind that.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.040]   It's stuff that we're going to see in five years.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.040]   That doesn't bother me so much.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.400]   I don't mind that.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.480]   If there were interesting conceptions, but I just didn't find it.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.360]   I, it's a lot of this stuff was just like, come on.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.360]   Come on.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.860]   I almost don't want to even Microsoft Silicon Valley office was rated, but they didn't steal
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.220]   any, any Windows machines.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.900]   They just stole the iPads.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:09.260]   That was over the Christmas holidays.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.580]   Only Apple products were stolen.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:12.340]   Why is it a hawk?
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:17.980]   Thieves stole more than $3,000 worth of iPads, five iPads.
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:23.980]   Microsoft had smartphones, surface tablets, untouched.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:29.260]   They had 14 million unsold surface tablets in the back.
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.460]   They're not going to touch on them.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:36.860]   Are they going to be, are they going to be given discounts on those anytime soon?
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.980]   I, you know, surface is not selling like crazy.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:40.980]   Is it?
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.980]   Have you played with the surface?
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:42.980]   I have.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   I have bought one.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:44.980]   I've, it's fine.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:49.020]   I just not a big talent guy, but if the price is right, I could be.
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.780]   I saw my first one in the wild.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.780]   What do you think?
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:52.780]   Um, I know.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:57.580]   I mean, I've seen, I've seen one before, but I have never seen anybody else using one that
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:58.580]   I have never seen.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.980]   I saw somebody, a guy at an airport, he was sat next to the next.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.980]   He looked depressed.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   He didn't look that happy.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:08.300]   I don't know whether that was like the flight, his flight was delayed or what, but he was
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.660]   sat and he had the tablet out on the kickstand on his lap and I was like, I was like, that's
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.340]   that's and by the way, that is not a felicitous arrangement.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:17.860]   The tablet kickstand on your lap.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:18.860]   No, it's not.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:19.860]   It's very wildly.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:20.860]   It's kind of.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:21.860]   Watch, test.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.180]   Lou Mm and the chat room, who does work for Microsoft?
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.180]   I know.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.180]   He made an interesting point.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:30.020]   He said it was a developer's office and in developers office, really the only mobile
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:35.020]   devices they have are the iPads because they develop on lockdown desktops are actually
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:37.020]   bolted to the building.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.540]   I'm, I'm not going to say you're wrong, Lou.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:43.020]   I'm just saying that they reporter from the, uh, Santa's eight.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.380]   No, well, the Guardian reported it, but the Santa's a reporter tweeted.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.780]   No, it's true and there were surfaces there.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.740]   And they were, they, let me, let me find the tweet.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:56.380]   Although Curtis B says that they wouldn't have had this problem if they were using 27 inch
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:57.380]   laptop tablets.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:00.060]   You could carry that thing out the door.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:05.860]   Palo Alto Daily Post reporter Angela Ruggero, who had the story, confirmed it.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.580]   She said, so to everyone out there asking, yes, the story is very real.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:17.060]   Um, there, there were, there were smartphones and tablets.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.540]   I don't think they were locked down, Lou.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.540]   I don't know.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.380]   Maybe, maybe she missed the locks.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:26.820]   Uh, I don't know why they'd lock those down and not lock down their iPads.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.380]   Messenger's going to be retired.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.380]   March 15th.
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:30.380]   You use it.
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:32.500]   You know, I know in Canada, MSN messenger was huge.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:33.500]   Was it beginning?
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.980]   It was huge.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:35.980]   Not anymore.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   No, nobody.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.780]   I mean, does I am anyway?
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:42.980]   Well, a lot of people do I am, but they do Facebook messenger.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.220]   Facebook, or they use, uh, it's like the equivalent of I child BBM.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.220]   Right.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.220]   What do you use?
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:52.860]   I use it mostly G chat and I still use aim because I have a bunch of, uh, aim people.
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:53.860]   That's the people.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:54.860]   That's the people.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.700]   Yeah, because there's just a bunch of people.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:01.500]   There's just, there's literally like 20 people that I still keep in touch with.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.060]   That's the only reason why I still use it.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.060]   But only have aim?
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.540]   Well, it's the only account I know for them.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:11.900]   Oh, Nick, uh, says, Nick with the C says it was huge in the UK until my space came along.
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:12.900]   I really killed it.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:13.900]   Yes.
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.900]   Well, that worked out well.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:22.860]   Um, because I think the, the new use case for instant messenger for most people now is mobile.
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:23.860]   I just think it's interesting.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:26.780]   I mean, they're, they're literally turning off the server March 15th.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:30.300]   So it's, it's, you're not, it's not even legacy support, not even legacy support.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.500]   It's gone.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.500]   But what they're hoping people do is move to Skype.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:39.380]   It's like, well, I was talking very Joe Foley and, uh, she said Microsoft even admitted
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.380]   this.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.300]   The whole strategy is to get people to have Skype launch when they turn on their computer
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.540]   and leave it running all day.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:49.180]   So the Skype really, the idea eventually is you becomes your phone.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.380]   This is, this is Microsoft's kind of stealth in, you know, wedge into telephants.
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:55.380]   27 inch phone.
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:58.420]   Now you're talking.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.860]   I'd leave it on on my phone.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.460]   If I want, don't you want a phone on your iPad mini?
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.500]   Oh, I admit it.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.700]   I know the perfect wallpaper.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.700]   We like you want.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:08.820]   Sir, in the front row, sir, you want a phone on that, don't you?
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:09.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:10.820]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.820]   Tell me the next pro.
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:12.820]   It's the hot product.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:13.820]   That's nice.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:14.820]   You heard it here first.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.820]   It's perfect.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:16.820]   Then you don't have to carry your phone around.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.620]   You got everything you need right there.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.620]   You got apps?
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:21.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.900]   Well, you could put Skype or Tank or Vox or stuff.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.620]   You want it to be an AT&T cell phone or whatever.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:31.540]   I'd like to use data to make phone calls and not use one of them.
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:36.300]   That's what I would get because I want to, um, it's, you hear about the watch thing because
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.340]   I always want to have my phone in my pocket to make a cool, easy.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:39.340]   Well, now you're going to do this.
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:44.780]   If I had the tablet in my man bag, I could have my watch like the little, that's what
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.780]   I'm saying.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:50.020]   I just did the keypad on here and have a little Bluetooth asset on the laptop because they
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.020]   in the man.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:55.020]   The IM watch has a wired headset that comes from the reality into your ear.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.020]   Very dick-tracing.
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.020]   That's not good.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.860]   That's not nice.
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:00.460]   Do you have a MRSA?
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.460]   A man bag?
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.460]   A man bag.
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.460]   A male purse.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:05.460]   I have a...
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:06.460]   Wait, is it an actual MRSA?
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:07.460]   Is it just a...
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.460]   It is a...
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.460]   A burberry...
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   Oh, that doesn't count.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.460]   That's like a shopping bag.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:14.060]   A man bag would be something like a little bit smaller, a little...
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.060]   Well, I have a little...
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.060]   It looks like a purse.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:19.380]   Yeah, I have a little mulberry over the shoulder thing as well.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:20.380]   Wait, do you...
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:22.380]   This is my carry everything everywhere kind of...
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.380]   Piss.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.380]   You know, just slightly larger would be a messenger bag.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:26.380]   Yes.
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:27.380]   Then you would be a real man in this watch show.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:28.380]   The great thing about this one is that it just goes over to...
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:31.660]   You could do like Patrick Norton to have a 40 pound pack on it all.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:32.660]   Yes.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:33.660]   Two.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:34.660]   Two.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:35.660]   You could see him coming forward and backward.
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:36.660]   He's got chis like...
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:38.660]   Because Gee, he needs more help than...
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.660]   He's like a pet-liding Patrick Wilson, right?
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:43.020]   He doesn't stand out enough.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   I saw him coming...
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:47.180]   Like I said, we saw you at CES in the lunch line.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:50.020]   I saw him coming a mile away as Pac proceeds him.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.020]   By the way...
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:52.660]   It's actually his walk.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:55.020]   He has a very distinctive walk because he's carried such everywhere.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.380]   Why does he do that?
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:57.740]   Why is he carrying like a hundred pounds?
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.380]   I think he believes that one of those devices in the bag will be coming useful.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:04.460]   One day it will save his life.
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.460]   That's what's happening.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:06.460]   All right.
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:07.460]   And two Texas.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.660]   Let's feel the testosterone draining from that.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.900]   There is nothing more manly than a man bag.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.380]   It's kind of exercise.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.780]   It's like wearing weights when you go walking.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.780]   Except it's on your back.
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:19.780]   Or a shake weight.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:20.780]   It's like...
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:21.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.780]   Okay.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.780]   Shake weight?
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:27.580]   I can't see a shake weight without thinking a South Park.
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:28.580]   Now you got me thinking about it.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.580]   I just want to get back.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.580]   There was a little...
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.980]   I honestly didn't think that was a real product when I ever saw it.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:34.980]   I know.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.460]   I thought it was a parody.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.460]   I was like, "Really?
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:38.980]   I was watching it at the end."
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:39.980]   I was watching it at the end.
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   Can't make this stuff up.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:43.060]   That room says that thing that Patrick's carrying isn't it?
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.060]   One of his children.
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:47.300]   No, that's up here.
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.300]   That's the second head.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.300]   That's the third head.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:53.020]   He also carries two car batteries in case.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.020]   He actually used to.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.220]   I've driven his truck for a while.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:58.220]   He carried his truck?
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:59.220]   What?
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.220]   He carried two extra deep cycle batteries.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:02.380]   But that's from his Baja experience.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.420]   He should always carry extra stuff.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:05.980]   It's just Patrick.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:08.660]   Always been a character.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:10.460]   And then he wears a kilt.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:12.460]   Actually, I haven't seen him one in a time.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   He hasn't seen him one lately.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:14.460]   He's got out of the kilt.
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.460]   Hey, you know what?
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.460]   Do you miss...
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:17.460]   Do we have a best up?
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:19.460]   Do you know what you missed?
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:23.700]   And then, by the way, I'm just questioning, is Tom Merrick going to do the week ahead?
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.700]   Wow.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:25.700]   Well, let's...
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:26.700]   I'll tell you what.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.660]   Let's do the week ahead and then we'll see what you missed if you missed this week.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:29.660]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.140]   As you can see, I'm still putting things together down here in Los Angeles.
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:35.300]   But in the week ahead, I'll be back in Petaluma for a few shows.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.780]   I'm looking forward to seeing you then.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.460]   Other stories will be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:43.420]   Facebook holding a press event on Tuesday, January 15th.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:48.020]   Also on Tuesday, Disney to unveil a new gaming initiative called Infinity.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:54.020]   Wednesday, January 16th sees eBay's earnings call and Thursday, January 17th sees Intel
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.340]   earnings.
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:58.340]   Those are a few things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.980]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.540]   This is TWET.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.540]   Frame rate.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:04.020]   It's so weird because I go to my parents' place.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:06.260]   My parents never watch anything time shifted.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:11.460]   It's always some cable news station on there in sports at any given or the Hallmark Channel
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:16.060]   playing that whatever that show with Tom Selick is with the alcoholic and the dog.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.460]   Know how.
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.660]   Every week on Twitter, I put up a question.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:23.500]   If you follow me at IAS, that's my name, then here's the question.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:28.660]   What program do you use to find tags and arts to clean up your music library?
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.660]   Security now.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:35.700]   So speaking of same old, same old, we have Adobe who simultaneously issued security fixes
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.100]   for all of their things.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.180]   Also, Acrobat Reader and Flash Player plug-in.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.500]   I write my notes here, I just put blah, blah, blah.
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:47.260]   It's just as they just go and update yourself.
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.260]   Ditto.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.260]   Ditto, ditto.
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.260]   This week in Google.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.700]   Buy some candies, can you risk ban anything like that?
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.700]   You just go ahead.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:57.260]   What's really cool about it is that with permission, the data will be in there.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:03.260]   So when you go up to sleep in beauty, Leo, which I know you will, she'll say, "Oh, Leo,
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.020]   I have to do it, eh?"
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.020]   Twit.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:08.460]   Test drive one today.
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.900]   That's the great device.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.700]   People were asking in the chatroom, "The voice is the great Jim Cutler voice over expert
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:17.700]   extraordinaire."
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.340]   That's how you boot it.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:24.700]   Oh, wait, that's from Night from the Rock's Berry?
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.860]   Oh, no, that's the SNL skit.
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:31.740]   For those who are not watching today, probably best not to.
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.980]   This portion of the show, right?
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.220]   What do you think Facebook is going to announce this on Tuesday?
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:39.220]   What is that all about?
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:40.220]   It's the Facebook phone, surely.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.220]   Mobile.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.220]   It's got to be some sort of mobile announcement.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.780]   Oh, no, Facebook phone in the future, really?
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:46.300]   Facebook Land theme park.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.300]   Ooh.
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.700]   You get to meet all your friends in person.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:52.900]   Actually, it follows the stock price.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:55.100]   It goes way up and then just takes a sharp dive.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:56.740]   That's the roller coaster.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:59.820]   The Facebook stock price roller coaster.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:04.020]   Maybe they're announcing that Zuckerberg's price, the message, has gone up to 200 bucks.
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.620]   Actually, I hear Zuckerberg's going to North Korea.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.660]   He's going to try to friend the leader, the jerk leader.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:12.580]   So it's January 15th at Menlo Park.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.580]   The invite says, "Come see what we're building."
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.260]   So it's a theme park.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.740]   I don't think it's a phone.
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.180]   They've denied it over and over again.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:22.340]   Wouldn't that be ironic though, if after denying it nonstop, they'd just say, "Oh, by
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:23.340]   the way, we lied?"
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.660]   Well, he did learn a lot from Steve Jobs, right?
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.660]   Misdirection.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:29.540]   Maybe they'll just come out with a book.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:33.660]   It's just going to be, "Did you see that Mark's charging?"
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:36.420]   If you want to get an email to Mark Zuckerberg, it'll charge you a hundred bucks and you'll
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:37.420]   read it.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:38.420]   What?
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:39.420]   So Facebook has a...
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.420]   Hey, wait a minute.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.420]   He's selling for cheap?
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:42.420]   No.
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:44.260]   Wait, so if I'm the IRS, can I just like...
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.460]   Well, it's not everybody.
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:52.820]   So Facebook is kind of fooling around with a future that will...
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.820]   They did this before.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:58.860]   If you pay seven bucks, right, you can guarantee that your status update will appear on people's
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860]   timelines.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.260]   So it's all about allowing companies, allowing...
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:07.020]   Well, the more it's about allowing companies to get hold of users and make sure that their
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.780]   messages are really being seen.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:09.780]   Right.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:12.740]   But it's also about allowing people to connect with people in a really sort of emphatic
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.740]   way.
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:16.940]   So if I was holding an event, for example, that I really wanted my friends to definitely
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:20.700]   know they were invited to, I could pay seven bucks and have it pinned to the top of their
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:24.660]   walls that when they next logged into Facebook, they could say, "Hey, Will's got this event
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.700]   and he really, really, really wants you to come to it."
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.740]   Or you could just call them like a normal person saying, "You coming?"
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:35.460]   So not everybody gets this, but this is a screen cap that Mashable got.
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.100]   New message to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.900]   It says, "You aren't connected to Mark on Facebook, so your message would normally get
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.660]   filtered to his other folder.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:47.900]   You can send this message to his inbox for $100 or just send this message to his other
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:48.900]   folder."
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.980]   And then there's a big button that says, "Send to inbox for $100."
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:54.540]   That is so disturbing on so many levels.
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:56.660]   Well, you know you've been hard up for cash.
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:57.660]   It seems low.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:00.220]   I was going to say, "I'm going to charge more."
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.860]   That's surely the best angel investment $100 you could possibly spend, right?
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:05.780]   No, that's the best spam filter ever.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:06.780]   A hundred bucks.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.780]   You know what?
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:08.780]   That would be brilliant.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:13.020]   What if you charged every time someone wanted to email you just charged 50 cents?
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:17.300]   Now, when that reduced the amount of email you got and really time to people that really
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.580]   wanted to get to you?
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:25.540]   The strange thing is you only get it if you're not one of his 16 million followers.
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.580]   So nobody who's going to pay a hundred bucks is going to get this.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.580]   Huh?
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.580]   Revshare.
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:37.380]   Could you pay me a hundred dollars by getting some of that money?
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.820]   It should be, but I don't think there's any revshare involved here.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.980]   I think a member of our live studio audience is suggesting, "How would that work?"
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.060]   So I pay a hundred bucks.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.700]   Who gets the revshare?
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.700]   My friend?
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.700]   Facebook gets 30.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700]   Facebook gets 30 bucks.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.700]   Facebook gets 30.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:52.700]   Facebook gets 30.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:53.700]   And market 70.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:57.620]   Well, I hope Mark gets some.
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:58.620]   Why?
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:00.860]   He doesn't need it.
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:02.620]   You mean Facebook gets the whole hundred bucks?
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:05.100]   No, let's say it's not the founder of Facebook.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:09.820]   Let's say it's Steve Ballmer.
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:11.460]   Another person who's hard up for cash.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.460]   Would you point you-
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.460]   Let's pick someone else.
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.460]   Let's say-
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:15.460]   Let's say it's me.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:18.220]   You, Will Harris.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.580]   Would you get some of it in Facebook or get some of it?
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:21.580]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.900]   I think that's what's not- I don't think that's what's going to happen.
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:30.820]   I think if someone pays a hundred bucks to email me, Facebook takes 100 bucks on the
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.820]   sell table.
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:32.820]   Oh, that's evil.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.820]   Where's like LinkedIn?
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:36.380]   So if you pay for a premium feature on LinkedIn where you can email anybody even if you're
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.460]   not connected to them, you're paying LinkedIn.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.900]   LinkedIn doesn't give a rev share to the person you're trying to connect to.
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:42.900]   So because you're important and need to be connected?
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:43.900]   Well, they've been doing this much.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:47.420]   They already did it for a buck, right?
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.860]   And people did it for a buck?
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.660]   Well, yeah, a buck's cheap.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.660]   Oh, but see, I just said me a buck.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:56.660]   And don't do it to me because I don't read anything.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.660]   How many-
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:58.660]   How many-
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:42:59.660]   How many-
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:00.660]   What was in my inbox?
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:01.660]   49 bucks.
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:02.660]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:03.660]   So you're going to send the hunt?
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.660]   Couldn't you just hire one of those singing telegrams for a park cheaper and the stripper?
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:07.660]   You'll definitely notice it.
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:08.660]   Get a nice dripper.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:10.500]   Are you Mark Zuckerberg?
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:11.940]   I have a message for you.
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:12.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:13.940]   Let me open my mailbag.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.940]   You have a dental appointment next week.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:16.940]   It is Leona coming back again.
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:17.940]   Leona's-
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:18.940]   What the hell?
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.940]   Is this turned into a morning suit?
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.940]   All of a sudden-
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.940]   What are you doing, Chad?
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:27.940]   What is that?
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.940]   It's all flush.
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:29.940]   That was the stripper gram.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:30.940]   Oh, okay.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.940]   That's 100 bucks.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.940]   You know, you could get a singing telegram.
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:35.780]   It'd be so much more useful.
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:36.780]   And it would be more indelible.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:39.580]   Someone would remember the balloons and the dancing.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.940]   I don't know if you want them to associate that memory with you or-
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.260]   As opposed to the schmuck who gave 100 bucks over Facebook to send a message.
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.060]   You know, the drop, Chad?
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.060]   That was the drop.
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.060]   Wait for the drop.
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:56.980]   No, that was- There was a chat realm or sending in suggestions for videos in the background.
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.980]   Oh, you got-
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:58.980]   That's always fun.
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:43:59.980]   That's always fun.
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:00.980]   That's always fun.
[01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:01.980]   It's Metroid right now.
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:02.980]   We've got Super Mario Brothers.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:03.980]   Venture beat says it will be a phone.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:04.980]   I don't think so.
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:05.980]   I want it to be a theme park.
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:08.780]   I love the theme park.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.260]   What else would you have if you had a Facebook theme park?
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:13.260]   Well, think of all the games that are on Facebook or a farm bill.
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:14.260]   Farm fill.
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:15.260]   You could get a ten-jill thing.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.260]   You would get like-
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.220]   Instead of getting money, you would get like, you know, those people.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:23.220]   Paper tokens or things from a carnival and you could turn them in for prizes.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:24.620]   So it's not a poking room.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.940]   It's a theme park that's filled with farms and mobsters just roaming around.
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:28.940]   Poking room.
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:29.940]   I like that.
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:30.940]   Uh-oh.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:31.940]   Sucker land.
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:32.940]   Sucker land.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.940]   You've been suckered.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:37.780]   And just random pokes at any time.
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.780]   $50 a poke.
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:43.540]   Whoa, not that cali.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:47.860]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at carbonite.com online, backup done, right
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:49.940]   Mac or PC.
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:54.300]   If you need to get it back, you need to get carbonite.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:57.660]   Carbonite backup solves the big problem of backing up.
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.380]   First of all, it's got to be automatic, right?
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:01.620]   Because if you have to remember it, you're not going to do it.
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:06.700]   You can have every USB key in the world and you're still not going to remember to do
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.700]   it, right?
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.460]   It all says to be continuous so that if you make it change to a document, it immediately
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:12.460]   gets backed up.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:16.100]   If it only backs up once a week, what happens on day six and your hard drive crashes, you've
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:17.980]   lost six days worth of work.
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:19.540]   So automatic continuous.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:23.380]   Now I would submit it's great to have backups to USB keys.
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:26.620]   If you could find what you're looking for, we're an external hard drive.
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:31.140]   But you also should have offsite backup because if you know the worst happens, a fire, an
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:35.980]   earthquake, somebody steals all your stuff, you got to be able to get back, get it back.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:40.060]   And only offsite's going to solve that.
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:41.460]   You can encrypt it on the way.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:45.780]   Of course, it's automatically encrypted with SSL, but you can even encrypt it privately
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.780]   if you want.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.780]   Trust no one encryption only.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:48.780]   You have the key.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:52.060]   And by the way, one of the things I really like, you can see your data anytime, just
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:56.820]   log on to your carbonite account on any computer, even if you've never used it before, or they
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:59.460]   have the iPad and smartphone apps.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:03.420]   It's $59 a year per computer, less than $5 a month.
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:04.420]   That's real peace of mind.
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.620]   Go to carbonite.com, use our offer code.
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:12.340]   You'll get two bonus months, 14 months of the price of 12, when you decide to buy.

[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.300]   You don't need a credit card, just the offer code.
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:17.300]   Twit.
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.460]   We're big fans of carbonite.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460]   Highly recommended.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460]   Highly recommended.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.940]   All right, last chance.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:28.100]   Anything else from CES that you just have to, you think, has just got to mention?
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:29.780]   The robots over at the Lenovo.
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:31.300]   You know you told me I went over there.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.700]   And were they gone already?
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.700]   It's closed.
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.700]   It said closed for private meetings.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:36.980]   So what were these robots?
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:42.900]   So one was a robotic spider at the size of like a VW Beetle that you could drive.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.900]   Oh, cool.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:44.900]   The guy developed it.
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.820]   It was a Canadian student.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.940]   Developed it for Burning Man.
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.420]   And over the years, originally it was gas powered.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:52.020]   Now it's completely electric.
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:57.220]   And the other one was a very large snake called Titan Boa.
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.620]   And were they driving around the parking lot outside or?
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:02.220]   Yeah, Veronica got into the spider and was driving it around.
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:03.740]   Oh, I've got the video.
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:04.740]   This was on Texas.
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:05.740]   All right.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:07.340]   Giant robot spider.
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:08.340]   CES 2013.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:12.860]   I think they brought that snake to Google I/O this last year.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:13.860]   It's a pretty cool robot.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:14.860]   Wow.
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:15.860]   I mean, it's not really a robot.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:16.860]   It's more of a walking connection.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:17.860]   Oh my golly.
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:18.860]   Look at her go.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:19.860]   All right.
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:20.860]   I'm going to skip the Ford ad.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:21.860]   It's a sponsor.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.660]   It's our sponsor too.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:24.660]   It's OK.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:25.660]   Here she is.
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:26.660]   Veronica Belmont.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.660]   Belmont reporting from CES.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:28.660]   Can I play this?
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:29.660]   Do I have your permission?
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:30.660]   Yes.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:31.660]   Jonathan, here I go.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:33.860]   I know you're the creator of the Mondo Spider standing engineering.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:34.860]   How did it come about?
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:36.660]   I'm skipping ahead because I want to watch your drive.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:37.660]   I'm going to be phosphate batteries.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:38.660]   It's 100% electric.
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:39.660]   Come on, Veronica.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:40.660]   There's schools.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.660]   Three, four, and it's like driving a tank.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:43.660]   Oh my god.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.660]   I don't want to run you over.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:48.140]   Oh my god.
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.980]   And you control it or does he control it?
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:50.980]   Oh no, you can control it.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:52.980]   Can I check him back to my hotel?
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:53.980]   That was absolutely amazing.
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:54.980]   Oh, I want to see more.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:55.980]   That's cool.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.980]   You drive it like a tank.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:57.980]   There's two controls.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:58.980]   Oh, left and right.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:00.460]   It's like battle zone.
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:01.460]   It's not Felicia.
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.460]   Yes.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.180]   She probably hates it when people think she's Felicia there.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:07.660]   I've taken pictures of both of them together.
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:10.020]   Oh, we need one of those in the warehouse.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.020]   Was she good at driving that?
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.660]   Why don't you get the hang of it?
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.660]   It's pretty easy.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:15.300]   Yeah, because so you pull left to go left and you--
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:19.260]   You just got to make sure the feet doesn't step on someone else's foot.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.500]   So that was a burning man.
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.340]   That's caused some nightmares.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:23.340]   Wow.
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.820]   That's 100% power by electric energy.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   No gas motor.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:28.820]   That's kind of impressive.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.820]   And the other thing I thought was kind of cool is pretty pedestrian, but speaking of
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.620]   thumb drives, Kingston was showing off one terabyte thumb drive.
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:36.620]   I heard about that.
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:37.620]   That's a lot.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.620]   Yes.
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620]   And you know how much it costs?
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:41.020]   It was like, what's it, 15?
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:42.020]   Oh, $3,000.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:43.020]   $2,000.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.020]   Wow.
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:46.580]   I think the thing that I saw though I really liked, although I didn't see it, I just saw
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:50.340]   some videos of it, was the Audi Batmobile.
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:51.340]   I did not see the Batmobile.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:52.340]   I'll take one.
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:53.340]   What is it?
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:57.100]   Which is, so Audi's put in into its new S7 cars.
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:02.820]   And it basically is an autonomous system for parking, but for also coming and meeting
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:04.180]   you wherever you are.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:07.980]   So you can be stood like at waiting outside a hotel or waiting at the bottom of a parking
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.420]   lot, press a button and the car will make its way out of the parking spot, drive its
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:15.180]   way to where you are, an idle sat right next to you.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:16.180]   Oh, no.
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:17.740]   Like a little remote whistle for your car.
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.780]   So to self their lay, that's pretty awesome.
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:21.780]   You go pretty much.
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.780]   No, it's obviously a prototype, right?
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.980]   Yes, but they said they aren't going to be bringing it to their next generation of cars.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.460]   It's definitely not just a concept.
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:31.340]   You know, I give a lot of credit to Ford because they kind of introduced the idea of
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:35.580]   going to CES in the first place saying we're consumer electronics device.
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:37.820]   And now every manufacturer is doing this, which is great.
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:44.620]   Here's some video from gtspirit.com piloted driving for parking maneuvers and parking
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:45.620]   garages.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.260]   Wow.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:53.660]   So this car is just going to, you know, is it legal to, I mean, don't you have to have
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.500]   a human in there legally?
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.500]   I'm not sure.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.420]   I know they've approved in many states, including here in California.
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:02.100]   I guess maybe by the time you get on cars, but there's a human.
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:04.100]   When you get on to the hotel property, you don't have to buy the roads.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.100]   You can do anything you want to watch.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.300]   So now she's arrived at the hotel.
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.340]   She's getting out of the car and the car is just going to park itself.
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:12.340]   Wow.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.180]   She's using a smartphone app.
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.340]   It looks like.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.300]   So someone manages to act your phone to get your car.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:24.500]   Do they have really do they have to have infrastructure in the lot to tell the car where
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.500]   to go or.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:28.340]   Oh, it's going to listen to some music.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.340]   It's next.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.860]   It turns on the lights.
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:31.860]   Good.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:32.860]   Not going to need stuff.
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:35.060]   It's a red LED light that goes across the grill.
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:38.060]   Wow.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:41.220]   I don't know how comfortable I'd be in walking.
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.220]   You just walked away.
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.740]   I'm not this park itself.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.340]   Oh, watch out for the.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:46.500]   Oh, whoa, it's not.
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.860]   Okay, it's a little shaky.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.060]   It looks like an eight year old is driving it.
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:55.260]   I just wait for it to hit someone and then you got to loss it.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.620]   By the way, they've edited the hell out of this.
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:00.620]   Probably taken out all the crashes.
[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.620]   It's going really, really slowly.
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.620]   It's really slowly.
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:05.620]   I wonder if they tried entering this.
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:06.620]   Okay, this is at this point.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:07.620]   The type of challenge?
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.620]   At this point, this is totally prototype.
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:11.620]   Right.
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:12.620]   This is not.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.540]   Well, you know, it's actually worked better in the closed off environment because it can
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.540]   sense the walls.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.540]   Right.
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:17.540]   Right.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:19.100]   And it goes slowly so that doesn't.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.100]   Yeah.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:21.100]   Well, there's a spot.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.420]   Wait, will it keep circling if there's no available spots?
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:26.020]   And then the next morning you get it.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.020]   It doesn't matter.
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:28.020]   It didn't park.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:29.020]   It just drove the whole time.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:35.140]   Oh, just what they really, if they want to test this, they got to get four or five more
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.140]   doing it.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:38.140]   And then see what happens.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:40.900]   They got to do it during a busy day at the Costco parking lot.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:44.700]   Can you, is there a selection on the smartphone app to make it park like a D bag and take up
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:45.700]   two spots?
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:52.700]   You understand that the cost of a, you know, an 18 year old kid to do this in a quarter
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.220]   of the time is less than the cost of the technology.
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.020]   And just as liable to damage your car.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:51:59.020]   Right.
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.020]   They're, they're taking the mouth.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:03.020]   I was keeping 18 year old kid.
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.020]   This is just those kind of circumstances.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:07.020]   This is going to put people out of work.
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.100]   Yeah, it is.
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:14.980]   You know, it's, it's really not one of the, one of the few jobs that American kids can
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:15.980]   do and that's it.
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:16.980]   It's gone.
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:22.300]   Especially that, that, that jies with their, their schedule.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:23.660]   We know that Twitter's making money.
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:31.460]   Margaret Wilson says it is according to, according to the Guardian, Twitter UK has posted profits
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:32.860]   of get ready.
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:34.980]   16,000 pounds, 500.
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:35.980]   Wow.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:36.980]   What's that about?
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:37.980]   A few million bucks.
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:38.980]   16,000 pounds.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:39.980]   I don't know.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:40.980]   What is it?
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:41.980]   I was like 20.
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:42.980]   That was an exchange.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.980]   $20,000.
[01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:44.980]   That's a pretty niche.
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:45.980]   It's like a million million dollars or something.
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:46.980]   No, it's nothing.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.980]   It's nothing.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.380]   Well, it's probably one of those things.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:52.740]   So there's been lots of controversy in the UK about global companies, particularly internet
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:56.220]   companies who have UK subsidiaries, which make no money for tax purposes.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.220]   Same in the US.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:01.060]   So I suspect the Dutch sandwich and the French chandover.
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:04.460]   They call it, there's a name for it.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.460]   There's a name for it.
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:07.460]   There's a name for it.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:10.260]   You basically move all the profits to the one R and that's in the least tax.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.260]   It goes to the Irish.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:12.420]   They go to Ireland.
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:14.300]   That's going to be the upside title of Dutch sandwich.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.300]   We're no actually refused it already.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.300]   Oh.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:18.660]   Kickstarter had a great year.
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:22.980]   I got $20 million pledged and I still haven't gotten my freaking dice.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:25.900]   I did get the Joey bra and I got to plywood.
[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:28.940]   Well, we're going to start getting some of those high profile failures.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.940]   The pebble.
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:30.940]   I'll get the pebble.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:31.940]   I'm going to get the pebble.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:34.180]   I did buy, I think an Uya.
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:35.340]   That's supposed to come soon.
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:39.260]   I got, you know, they showed it at CES, the VR helmet.
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.260]   What was that called?
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:41.260]   Arculous.
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:42.460]   Yeah, the Oculus Rift.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.460]   You pledged to that?
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.460]   I pledged to that so I should be getting one of them.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:48.260]   Well, 2013 is going to be the year that you get delivered.
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:52.900]   You should come in to work one day with everything you purchased off Kickstarter and
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:53.900]   just walk in.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.500]   The Joey Bra doesn't fit.
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.140]   It's too small.
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:03.540]   Oh, we had some fans approaches, Twitter fans approaches with something they wanted
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.540]   to give to you.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:07.460]   They're starting a Kickstarter for a standing desk.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.700]   Oh, it was like the dart was called the Darwin, I think.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:13.340]   Because we had a standing desk guy for Kickstarter successful.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.460]   I mean, it was Indiegogo on the Gizwiz.
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:17.460]   Was this week?
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:18.460]   This week.
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.460]   This week.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.460]   The other one.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.460]   We had a coach Chad and I and said, you know, we love Leo.
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:22.460]   Could you show him this?
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.460]   And I said, yes.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:24.860]   And I don't know where I put it.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:29.380]   Father Robert Balasu is the host of this week in Enterprise Tech, which you can catch
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:30.500]   each and every Monday.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:31.500]   What, noon?
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:32.500]   Noon.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.500]   Pacific time.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.980]   Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern.
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.220]   20, 2000 UTC.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.220]   That's right.
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:39.220]   On the Twitter.tv.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:41.340]   What do you got coming up to you?
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:44.980]   Well, tomorrow we're talking all about actually, sit stand.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:48.340]   We've got a representative from Ergotron who's going to explain to us why it's good.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:49.340]   They make things nice.
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.340]   Yes, they do.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.900]   We use an Ergotron on the set.
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:52.900]   That's right.
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.940]   The twi-the twi-the set is an Ergotron desk.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:59.780]   And the info coming back about letting your employees other sit or stand throughout the
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:03.500]   day, it's unequivocally good.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:04.500]   You need to do that.
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.500]   It's good for their health.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:06.900]   Both sit and stand or just stand.
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:07.900]   Sit and stand.
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:08.900]   So that's the keys.
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:09.900]   Move up and down.
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:10.900]   Exactly.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:13.380]   So Ergotron, I, in fact, I saw this at Mackerel last year, has ones that just do it, you
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.180]   know, not want one of those, but they're expensive.
[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.980]   But I would like one of those.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:22.020]   Maybe in the middle of the show, I'd press a button and we don't have to stand down.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.980]   Just have it randomly go up and down.
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.500]   That would be great for courts.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.660]   So I'm telling you, when to all rise.
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:28.660]   All rise.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.500]   Just raise the table.
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.580]   Roger Chang, it's so good to see you again.
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:37.340]   I was really pleased to see you at CES too with the whole Tekzilla gang.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:39.100]   Do you have some Tekzilla CES specials?
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.100]   What are you doing?
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:45.420]   Yes, well, we did our Tekzilla coverage this past week, but we'll have our Monday wrap-up
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:46.420]   episode.
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:47.420]   So check it out.
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:48.420]   So you did it live.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.420]   No, we did not do it live.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.420]   We released it already.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:51.420]   Got it.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:55.860]   You can find it at revisionsfeed.com/tekzilla or youtube.com/techhd.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:01.020]   T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A. Are you working on their new Tekfeed, the Tekfeed channel at all?
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:04.340]   Yes, I'm doing a show called the downloaded with Jim Lauterback.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:05.980]   I can't wait.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:07.540]   So this is youtube.com/techfeed.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:08.540]   Yes.
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.860]   And you're going to do something called the downloaded.
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:12.460]   No, no, I am doing it.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.460]   And what is it about?
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:20.100]   It's basically a pundit show with two guests, Jim and alcohol.
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.100]   That's novel.
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.820]   It's actually pretty fun.
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.820]   We had Dylan Twainy and...
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:25.820]   That's fun.
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:28.900]   Well, I'm glad Jim's doing a show.
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:29.900]   That's great.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:30.900]   Between running the company.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:31.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:33.460]   Busy guy.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:37.740]   And a lot of your coverage is also on that feed, the Tekfeed.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:41.180]   That's the new revision three channel on YouTube.
[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:42.180]   Yes.
[01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:43.180]   Love it.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:44.180]   Love it.
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:47.300]   I know Stubbs is doing a show with Darren Kitchen of Hack 5 called...
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:48.300]   The Threat Wire.
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.300]   Threat Wire.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:50.300]   Threat Wire.
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:56.180]   And of course, somebody who's been a pioneer in internet broadcasting from Channel Flip,
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:58.060]   my old friend Will Harris, how's Channel Flip do?
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:56:59.060]   Are you still there?
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:00.060]   You sold it.
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:01.060]   Oh yeah.
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.060]   But you stick around.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.060]   Oh yeah.
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:04.700]   So we have just, we're doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:05.700]   We're going nuts.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:11.700]   We've just launched a new YouTube channel, cool, which is go to youtube.com/huhaha.
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.180]   Of course, H-U-H-A.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:15.180]   H-U-U-H-A.
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:16.180]   No, H-U-H-A.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:17.180]   H-U-H-A.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:18.180]   H-U-H-A.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.180]   The D-A-S-A.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:20.180]   The D-A-S-A.
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:21.180]   The D-A-S-A.
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:24.580]   I basically describe it as Adult Swim meets Monty Python.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:26.380]   Oh, awesome.
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:27.380]   Lots of funny, stupid...
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:28.380]   Monty Swim.
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:29.380]   Monty Swim.
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:30.380]   This is impressive.
[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:31.380]   Or Adult Python.
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:33.620]   Rightly colored animated flip flapery for adults.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:34.620]   Exactly.
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.620]   So...
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.780]   Now how does this work?
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:39.460]   Do you go out and you hire animators and come up?
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:43.380]   So we have lots of animators working and producing all sorts of funny stuff.
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:45.380]   Do you know a guy called Mr. Webel?
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:46.860]   Mr. Webel produces Webel and Bob.
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:47.860]   He is not funny.
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.940]   Webel's wobble, but they don't fall down.
[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:50.940]   Right.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:55.540]   So we have Mr. Webel's one of our animators and lots of really great fun, cool content.
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:58.100]   And everyone should go there and subscribe.
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:57:59.100]   Beef House.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:00.100]   Beef House.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:02.100]   Which is like the A-Team but with butchers.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:09.100]   I have too many channels to open.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:12.460]   I've got channel flip open in three different...
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.460]   It's a mashup to it.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.460]   It's a mashup.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:16.460]   Mashup Leo's cool.
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:18.260]   Well, I'm so glad to hear that.
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:22.780]   Channelflip.com or youtube.com/channelflip or youtube.com/hooohaxley.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.740]   If you go to any one of them it will link to that.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:25.740]   Oh, you'll get to all of them in the app.
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:27.340]   Look at all the channels you have.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.460]   We have like 140, I want to say.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.460]   Wow.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:34.060]   Even like the YouTube gives you lots of money and then you just...
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:35.060]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:38.460]   So Huha is one of the channels to be created with the YouTube original program.
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:39.460]   That's what it's called.
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:40.460]   Yeah.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:42.020]   Really cool.
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.100]   Congratulations.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.260]   Is that because you got Mr. Webel?
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:47.060]   Was that the selling point?
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:48.460]   Mr. Webel was an intrinsic part.
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:52.900]   The beef house was an intrinsic part of that Google can't get enough beef house.
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:53.900]   Right.
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:54.900]   Cool.
[01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:57.940]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons, 3pm Pacific right after the NFL football.
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:58.940]   Actually, no.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:01.540]   What are you going to do next week?
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:02.540]   I don't know.
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:04.780]   Next week we have the playoffs.
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:06.420]   The Niners will be playing...
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:07.420]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:08.420]   Who won?
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:09.420]   The Seahawks.
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:10.420]   No, no, the Falcons won.
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:11.420]   The Falcons.
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:13.220]   Well, that's why I'm saying the same as the Falcons.
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:14.780]   And then who's winning today?
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:15.780]   Is it New England winning?
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:16.780]   I think New England was beating the snobs.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:19.820]   Last I saw it was New England was winning.
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:20.820]   These guys don't care.
[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:23.420]   See, nobody who actually watches this channel could care less.
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:24.860]   Good care less.
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.420]   Yeah, that's over.
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:30.020]   So no, we do it 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern time.
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:31.940]   11pm UTC.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:32.940]   Is it?
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:33.940]   Yep.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:34.940]   You know, because you watch.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:35.940]   Because I watch it.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:37.660]   You're on British standard time.
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.140]   Is that the same thing as UTC?
[01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:41.140]   BST is not the same as UTC.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.140]   So that's like 16.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.140]   You're off by an hour.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.140]   I think I'm off by an hour.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.140]   It's 11pm UK.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:46.820]   It's plus eight here.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:49.780]   So if we're at 1500 it would be 2300.
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:50.940]   Yeah, it's the same.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:51.940]   Yeah, it's the same.
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:53.940]   Yeah, you are on UTC.
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:59.380]   I don't believe that one hanging.
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:05.260]   Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to Chad Johnson, our producer, who did some yoman job at CES.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.740]   We have a lot of CES coverage to it.tv/specials.
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:12.620]   I'm very tempted to do an experiment.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:16.860]   Last night the NBC Nightly News covered this Java flaw.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:24.380]   And they, without permission, I'm not complaining, used a clip of me explaining it.
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.380]   They just pulled it from our channel.
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:30.340]   They said, you know, nationally syndicated tech journalist Leo LaPorte explained to his
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:34.140]   listeners how to disable Java and they show a little clip of me.
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:39.300]   But what if I play that clip with the surrounding NBC content on this show?
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.300]   Will they pull?
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.300]   Take down notice.
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.980]   Oh, well, I'll get a take down view.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:43.980]   Absolutely.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:44.980]   No question.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:45.980]   He's right somehow.
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:47.980]   You mean a little hypocritical?
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:49.620]   Well, I'm not going to.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:50.460]   I'm not going to take them down.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:51.460]   I think it's great.
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:55.700]   I'm thrilled just as they should be thrilled if I play some of their content on our little
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:57.580]   production here.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:00.220]   I can't if I had a link, I would do it, but I don't.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:02.580]   It's on MSNBC somewhere.
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:03.580]   That Brian Williams.
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.580]   He's such a cat.
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:06.260]   No, no, it was the weekend guy.
[02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:07.620]   Oh, nobody knows him.
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:09.220]   Actually, I wanted to show it.
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:10.220]   Can you find that?
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:11.220]   This is a chair.
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:12.220]   Do you have a link?
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:13.220]   The chair will give you a link.
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:14.220]   Are you in the chair?
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:15.220]   I'm just going to check out the whole time.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:18.340]   I cannot tell you how hard it is to do a show without the chatroom.
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.060]   Oh, where here it is.
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:21.060]   It came back.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:22.060]   Would you chatroom?
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.060]   Would you give me a link to that?
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:24.060]   Here we go.
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:26.540]   I want to show you, because now there's an ad at the beginning, so we won't take it right
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:27.540]   away.
[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:30.020]   But there's another thing I really liked about it.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:34.380]   Television coverage of technology has really improved significantly.
[02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:38.060]   For one thing, I thought that they did that technically an excellent job of covering this
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:39.940]   story, which is not an easy story.
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:43.860]   The difference between the Java and JavaScript and all of that stuff.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:44.860]   There he is.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.860]   Look at that.
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:48.860]   Wait a minute, stop.
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:49.860]   We've done this shot.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:51.420]   Roger, back me up on this.
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:54.700]   You always do this shot of a guy typing and then later of a guy's mousing.
[02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:57.660]   Let's back up a little bit.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:58.660]   This is beautiful.
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:03.300]   It's a wooden keyboard.
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:04.300]   What the hell?
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:09.820]   I mean, still have the clickety-clack keys, but I think technology coverage on the networks
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.980]   has improved considerably.
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:14.060]   It's a wooden keyboard.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:16.020]   There's enough to allow hackers to gain access.
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.020]   Okay, let's watch a little more.
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.020]   I'm doing a little bit of screen.
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.020]   Yeah, the guy they have the code.
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:21.340]   You got to have the word hacker.
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:25.100]   Once you gain control of someone's computer remotely, you can do a lot of mischief.
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:30.020]   The problem is in Java software, a computer language that runs in the background on millions
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:31.460]   of devices.
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.940]   Some say it's become a favorite exploit.
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:39.700]   I think it's got to be just stock footage.
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:41.300]   Yeah, of course.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.300]   From what?
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:43.300]   In the final.
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:44.300]   Wait, here I come.
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:45.860]   More typing.
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:46.860]   That was a hacker, by the way.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:47.860]   He had rings.
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:48.860]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:49.860]   Bling equals hacker.
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:51.660]   Anyone using browsers for PC.
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:53.940]   And you both have a dark room.
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:54.940]   Dark room.
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:56.540]   And they noticed they had her mousing.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:58.700]   Dell hasn't made that computer for 10 years.
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:00.380]   I know it's all stock footage.
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:05.460]   It is aware of the flaw, but that it's limited to the Java for browser's product.
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:07.740]   Adding a fix will be available shortly.
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:10.980]   But the US Department of Homeland Security is not waiting.
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:11.980]   But it's web.
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:12.980]   I think they actually do a good job.
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:14.380]   Well, disabled jobs explaining this.
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:16.260]   The latest security problem is the talk.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:17.740]   That looks like a real office.
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:19.740]   Tech journalist Leo LaPorte explained.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:20.740]   Whoo hoo.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:21.860]   On his weekly radio show.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:27.060]   If you go to the settings of your browser in Safari, I'm not complaining.
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:28.060]   We got a plug.
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:30.460]   They just can check the box.
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:33.740]   They captured the screen from our Twitter site and all that.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:34.740]   More typing.
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.740]   More code going by.
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:37.740]   More typing.
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:46.100]   It's sort of climaxes to this bit where there's got the typing and the overlay and the code
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.100]   is going down inside.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.860]   That's all stock footage.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:51.140]   We could recreate that.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:53.860]   I bet from just the stuff on the other side.
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:55.940]   That they did pick up when I'm talking.
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:56.940]   I'm wiping.
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:58.900]   I'm rubbing my eyes like I just woke up.
[02:03:58.900 --> 02:03:59.900]   Oh yeah.
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:02.260]   I was going to explain this Java thing.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:04.980]   I'm on the freaking radio.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.300]   If you don't, if you close your eyes, I don't sound sleepy.
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:09.580]   It's just anyway.
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:10.780]   So now let's see.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:13.100]   Let's see how long before we get the takedown notice from NBC.
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:14.100]   I guarantee you.
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:15.100]   24 hours.
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:18.660]   Not even probably.
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:21.060]   By the time I come in for quiet tomorrow, it'll be dying.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.980]   They'll be a takedown notice.
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:23.980]   Okay.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.780]   I'm laying down the gauntlet.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:31.020]   NBC, I've got one, two, three, four, five, six higher USB keys.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:32.020]   And a camera.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.300]   And a little camera.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.460]   If you don't take us down.
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:39.740]   I didn't mention actually the story that worries me the most.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.900]   And I almost attempted not to mention this.
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:43.980]   I'm nervous to mention this.
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:45.820]   There is a patent troll out there.
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:47.140]   At least I think they're, I don't know.
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:52.660]   Maybe they're not a patent troll who claims that they have patented podcasting.
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:57.060]   They apparently, I remember this, they sued Apple a little while ago.
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:59.340]   It's called Personal Audio LLC.
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.100]   And they claim they invented podcasting in 1996.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:07.340]   They have a patent, which was granted to them last year.
[02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:14.460]   And a system for disseminating media content representing episodes in serialized sequence.
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:18.740]   They sued and beat Apple, got a judgment of $8 million.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:24.220]   They've entered licensing agreements now with Sirius, Arcos, Kobe, RIM, Samsung, Amazon,
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:25.740]   and Motorola.
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:31.740]   They're now suing two of the biggest podcasters out there, Adam Corolla and how stuff works.
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:36.700]   Now we asked for a comment from either of them and both of them, probably at the advice
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:39.180]   of their lawyers said, "We aren't going to talk about this.
[02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:40.580]   We're not going to say a word."
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:42.780]   And I'm a little nervous about that.
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:47.340]   I would like to say, because I know we'll get a lawsuit next, right?
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.340]   Or channel flip.
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:49.340]   Somebody be on.
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:50.340]   Somebody.
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:54.340]   And what I would like to see the internet, the podcast community do is band together
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.740]   and loudly fight this.
[02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:59.940]   But so it does make me a little bit nervous.
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:04.100]   They sue in East Texas because that supposedly is a place that's quite favorable to these
[02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:06.740]   patent lawsuits.
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:15.420]   Personal audio says they invented this stuff back in 1996 or '95.
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:21.700]   All I can say is it makes, as somebody who does create content for the internet, this
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:26.460]   would be a devastating blow if we had to license this stuff.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:29.900]   If we got sued by these guys, I don't know if we could even afford to defend ourselves.
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:34.300]   And we certainly couldn't pay the kind of money that Apple ended up paying.
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:35.540]   It would put us out of business.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:40.580]   And it could put, frankly, podcasting out of business.
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:42.660]   So I just wanted to raise your awareness about this.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:45.660]   Certainly I think what would happen if we did get sued is we'd come to our audience
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.860]   and ask for your help.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:51.380]   I would love to help Adam and how things work.
[02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:56.020]   But I think they both decided probably their lawyers have decided to be best to stay quiet.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:58.900]   And I hope, and I hope not settle, but perhaps even settle.
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:00.860]   See, that's the temptation.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:02.860]   They're not going to ask $8 million from Adam Corolla.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:06.860]   They're going to say, well, it's going to cost you all $300,000 to fight ask.
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:09.220]   The largest amount they can get away with.
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:10.220]   Yeah.
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:12.660]   That's going to cost you less than the League of Action.
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:13.660]   Yeah.
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:14.660]   Yeah.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:15.660]   And that's why I think we need to all band together.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:19.220]   We need to make it, you know, together we have a chance.
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:20.220]   Singly we don't.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:24.660]   It's a, you know, scrap like this that makes me want to go out and punch people.
[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.660]   I just really am.
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:26.660]   It just, it is.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:28.700]   Can I, will you be an expert?
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:29.700]   I don't know.
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:30.700]   I don't know.
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:34.500]   I've been angry of late, especially this past week, just because I hate crowds.
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.980]   But yeah, it makes my blood boil.
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:38.940]   Well, I know we can count on our audience.
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:40.020]   It makes my blood boil too.
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:43.580]   And also it is exactly what's been wrong.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:46.860]   We've talked about this pattern on since for a long time.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:49.860]   And I can't wait for Roger to get changry.
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:50.860]   Getting changry.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:51.860]   Changer, changer.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:52.860]   Changer behind bars.
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:54.860]   That's what I need.
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:57.460]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:59.060]   We'll keep you up to date on that story.
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:00.060]   Believe me.
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:04.100]   And we do have a request out to both Adam and how things work.
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:09.340]   And by the way, we talked about Aaron Schwartz, who helped write the code for Reddit.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:12.940]   Sometimes is, I think incorrectly credited as being a Reddit co-founder.
[02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:17.140]   Reddit founder Alex O'Hanean joins us Wednesday on triangulation.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.340]   I'll certainly we'll talk about Aaron because I'm sure he'll have much to say.
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:24.940]   That'll be Wednesday at 3 p.m. civics, 6 p.m. Eastern time on Twitch.
[02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:25.940]   Thanks for joining us.
