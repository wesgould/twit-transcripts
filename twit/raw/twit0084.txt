[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   They're back from Vegas.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Our prodigals have returned and now it's time to talk CES
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   on TWIT.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Let's start with somebody who's never been on Twit before
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   but is an old friend from Tech TV Days, Hans Schoy.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Hey, Hans, it's good to talk to you.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   You've got it done a long time.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   It's been ages.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   It's been ages.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And you're doing "Indigital Now."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I know which is really great.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   That's a video podcast on revision 3.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yep.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Keep them busy.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Did you guys do stuff from CES for that show?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Yeah, we actually did two episodes.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   We were there for four days.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Like that whole four days at CES.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And then later I want to talk about your home entertainment
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   contest because that's a great contest.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   That was fun.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And I agreed with your choices.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Well, you got to watch the show to get the results,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   but I was a little disappointed with the results.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You were?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Well, you know, maybe I'll reveal a little bit of it.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I'll get a good point.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Yeah, because when Gregor comes on, he never reveals anything.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Yeah, he's pretty close-mouth.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Anyway, it's great to have you on.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And we'll talk about, I think mostly this show is going to be about CES.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We did so much coverage on the Twit Network for Macworld.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I mean, last count, we've posted 19 podcasts about Macworld in four days.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And I think there are about five or six more.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So we have enough about the iPhone already.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Okay.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Joining us also, Corey Doctorow.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Great to have you there.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Thanks for joining us from Boing Boing.net.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And also the author of a new short story collection called Overclocked.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Overclocked?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Story's the future present.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So is it the present or the future?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Stories of the future present.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   My new writerly gimmick is predicting the present.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So it makes being a science fiction writer a lot easier.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   You take something in the news like, you know, someone announcing that they're using Mexican sweatshops
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   to produce labor for gold farming and multiplayer worlds.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Right.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And then you write a story about it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.600]   And then as that phenomenon grows, every time there's a new story about it, someone writes
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.000]   to you and says, you predicted this, man, you totally predicted this.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Except that it was going on.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yes.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   That's right.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I predicted it after it started.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It was tough, but I did it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.600]   If you think about it, I mean, things like that are so futuristic in science fiction that
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.000]   they make perfect premises for sci-fi.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I mean, people actually working to make gold for people in World of Warcraft.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And this is a booming economy.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Absolutely.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And, you know, whether or not the stories that surround this are a mixture of truth and fiction.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.320]   And the nice thing about writing science fiction about that is that you don't have to worry
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   about which they are.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.480]   Because, you know, this is sort of this kind of dark artist surrounding swirling with rumors
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   and so on.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   So they say that, you know, in parts of China, the rice harvest didn't come in this time.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.000]   Because rice farmers had figured out that they could make more money farming gold.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.600]   I don't even care whether that's true.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   It's so cool.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Right.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   So as a science fiction writer, I don't have to worry about it.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   I don't have to care.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   It's just a great premise.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   I love it.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   I love it.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   John C. Devorek is also here.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.440]   Like Han Shoy John was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.240]   Did you go to Macworld when you got back on Thursday at all, John?
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.600]   For a few minutes, I didn't find the show that entertaining.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   I don't know.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.240]   I mean, of all of the stuff that went on, certainly CES, of course, has always had, you
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.280]   know, thousands of product announcements and a lot to do with high-def TV.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.160]   And in fact, I'm hoping, you know, we were going to have Robert Heronon because he's
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.960]   our high-def TV expert.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.440]   And apparently Patrick and Roger Chang just pulled up in the van from CES about 10 minutes
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   ago.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.120]   And so he's helping them offload and we'll get him on as soon as he's done doing that.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.000]   Maybe all three of them.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.280]   But I have to say to me, if you take all of the announcements put together from CES,
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.480]   none of them got as much press or interest as the iPhone announcement from Apple.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.800]   That's, you know, I've written about this.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.400]   It's always going to be the case because of the number of Mavens out there who just,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.120]   whatever Apple does, they fall over themselves like a bunch of maniacs, you know, just to
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.520]   promote whatever Steve does.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.360]   He's got a bunch of people hypnotized.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.640]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.240]   The, absolutely, the reality of the distortion field was on in full force in San Francisco
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   on Tuesday.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.480]   Not that the phone wasn't interesting or that the phone got more attention at CES.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.120]   In fact, that was kind of the running gag, which is the biggest announcement at CES,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.800]   because Apple's announcement in San Francisco of the iPhone.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.240]   I'm wondering if Apple should start thinking of it as itself as a consumer electronics
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.520]   company and just go to CES, you know, give it up and go to CES next year and the year
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   after both.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.720]   No, I think that'd be crazy, man.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   You think so?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.040]   Well, they've dropped the word computer from the name of the company.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.200]   They're just Apple now.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.960]   But why would they go to CES where they just be one part of the show?
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.080]   They get to be the whole show and they get all the publicity at CES because the entire
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.840]   like, you know, electronics reporting universes has got their ears on that week anyways.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   So.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.080]   And I think a lot of people would rather see Steve talk than Bill Gates talk.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.000]   Maybe that's well, you know, the other thing is is Apple is, you know, that's a more of
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.560]   a, I mean, it's a trade show CES and then Mac world expose a consumer show.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.360]   So you have a, did you go to any keynotes, John?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   I never go to keynotes.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   Never.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   Well, you go next year when it'll be Bill Gates last CES keynote.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.600]   You know what, I'm wondering whether he's going to even do it next year.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.960]   So maybe this was the last one.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.120]   This one should have been the last one.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120]   Boy, what a snooze.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.280]   I didn't go, of course, but I watched it on TV.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.240]   Yeah, you can watch these things on the web and they're crowded.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.560]   They have a whole bunch of these, you know, fanboys, you know, that show up to these
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   keynotes.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.440]   They listen to these guys drone on and on.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.080]   It's just mazes me that these people put up with it.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.800]   It's usually a big giant advertisement for the company.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.600]   Han, did you go to the Bill Gates?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.360]   I feel the same with John.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   I don't go to the keynotes because it's, whenever they, any kind of major press conference
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.520]   like that, I just find it, well, you're not really showing anything.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   Right.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.400]   They just hide all the stuff that we're going to uncover anyway.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   So why bother?
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.880]   There were a couple of things interesting, I thought about what, I mean, you're trying
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.040]   to read tea leaves, but one thing, I mean, they mentioned the zoom, but very briefly,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.400]   and what was really surprising is that they said, and place for sure is alive and well.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.560]   Remember the zoom doesn't support Microsoft's place for sure DRM.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.840]   It looks like Microsoft now has two DRM platforms competing with one another.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.680]   Yeah, I think Microsoft may have a big mistake, but not allowing the other to support it because,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.000]   you know, they're picking off a lot of...
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Computers.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.280]   Yeah, a lot of users, that companies are making the hardware that does work for play for sure.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.760]   Now you don't have their marketing dollars really pushing it.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   No, I wonder.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.840]   I got the feeling that Microsoft was saying to these companies, don't worry, the zoom is
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.880]   just a little experiment.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.280]   I mean, Bill's been downplaying the zoom since before it came out.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.400]   Well, it was a big risk.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.080]   Was there a lot of zoom stuff at the show?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.920]   The funny thing is I walked by the Microsoft booth and they just have a big corner of the
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   zoom.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.120]   Like, you know, they have a bunch of partners lined up to show the board.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.080]   Microsoft had a huge booth that was the size of one of the old, it's old Comdex booths,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.160]   huge with all these, you know, these strategic partners.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.040]   I didn't notice any zoom stuff.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.440]   I suppose it was stuff in there.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   No, it was in the corner, but no one was there.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.000]   The empty corner of the booth was where zoomed in.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Wow.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.720]   Yeah, it was pretty funny because it was actually on the big side of the hall, but it was empty.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   No one was...
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   I think that's how two people were thinking of them.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.800]   Is this surprise anyone?
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.600]   I mean, like, should we be shocked that we discovered once again that no one out there
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.320]   is looking for a device that will let them do less with their music?
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.320]   It's so hobbled.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.040]   It's hard to believe that they even...
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.320]   Totally stunned, Corey, that this would happen.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.200]   You know, and like, yeah, maybe plays for sure as alive and well.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.480]   I mean, that is to say it's no more dead than it was before they launched the zoom.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.840]   It wasn't particularly a success beforehand.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.040]   The thing that gets me is the CE companies that are like, you know, if Microsoft is
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.680]   Lucy in the football, the CE companies like Toshiba, they're the Charlie Browns who keep
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.120]   running for it and Microsoft keeps yanking it away.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.560]   They fool them every time.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   I've actually got a theory about DRM, which is that it's basically impossible to get people
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.240]   to accept something more restrictive than what they've got.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:10.840]   So if you've got a stake in what happens to the device or the platform, you can't afford
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.560]   to make it super, super restrictive because you might make it so restrictive that no one
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.200]   wants it and then you're just out, right?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.080]   On the other hand, if you can get someone else to take all the risk, then your optimal
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.400]   strategy is to take the most restrictive platform and add one quantum of liberty to it.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.600]   See if the market will take it.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   If they won't add one more, this only works if you can get someone else to take all the
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640]   risk for it.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.360]   So you have like the recording industry looking at, say, DVD and going, well, there's a platform.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.280]   You know, we couldn't sell it by the viewing.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.480]   We couldn't rent it.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.840]   We couldn't charge you extra if you were watching it on two players instead of one.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   We couldn't make it no loan and then charge more for one that you were allowed to loan
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.200]   and all that stuff.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.040]   Maybe we can add those features to music, but we're going to have to do it.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.240]   Like one drop at a time and we don't want to be down or out when the market says, no,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   we don't want that.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.000]   So we'll just get everyone else like Microsoft and Toshiba to take the risk.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.360]   And so we keep seeing these like crumbs of liberty being added to DRM.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.880]   Is it an opportunity for Apple at this point to say, hey, we'll take the lead and back
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   off a little bit?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Oh, no.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.400]   Apple doesn't want Apple doesn't care about DRM.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.440]   The thing Apple likes about DRM, isn't that it keeps you from copying music?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.120]   It's that it raises the cost of switching to a competitor's product.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.800]   Yeah, that's the most valuable asset.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.120]   If you buy tunes for the iPod, you're stuck with the iPod.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.280]   Yeah, if you buy 10 tunes a year for 10 years, that's a hundred bucks that it costs you when
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.320]   you throw away your iPod and buy a competitor's product.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.160]   I mean, that's all they care about.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.080]   You got the head of Apple's iTunes project saying that they would keep DRM even if the
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.560]   labels didn't want it.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   And when musicians show up and say, like, I'm an indie artist, I don't want any DRM on
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   my music.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.520]   Can you sell it through the iTunes music store without the DRM?
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.840]   Apple says, no.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.280]   Some record labels like Warner's show up, you know, Bronfen turns up and says, you
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.880]   know, we want you to open this up for interoperability.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.280]   Apple rebuffs them.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.960]   Apple's doing DRM because it's good for Apple.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.600]   It has nothing to do with the music.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Good point, Han.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   Were there other?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.360]   I mean, was there a flourishing MP3 player market minus the iPod?
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.600]   I mean, there must have been.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   I would.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   I would.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   And Sansa and all of these.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   You would.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   Sanders is really the second biggest player in the heart.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   I like to send his stuff.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   I like to send this one myself.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.240]   Yeah, well, it's affordable too.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.240]   That's the big thing.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.800]   I think they've done the affordable with the capability.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.440]   They have lost features and it comes at a good price.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.560]   But the real thing is when I was walking around looking at MP3 players, I was like,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.960]   I feel like MP3s are like so 10 years ago.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.560]   It feels like it's like you do add a new feature, but it still plays MP3, you know?
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   Right.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.800]   You know, there wasn't a lot of, you know, in a few years ago, there was a lot more MP3
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   stuff.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.440]   And Sansa is going to couple of these other guys who brought out these pretty remarkable
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   players for very low prices, maybe killed the market off.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   I saw a lot of what I did see was a lot of whack job USB devices.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.800]   You know, they have, they have a pen that's an actual pen that has a USB device.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   And it's like something, the spies in the 40s would love.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.720]   And there's all kinds of weird stuff like that.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   I noticed.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.200]   And you know, this, the one thing about CES that we probably should mention right off
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.120]   the top is that the show sucks.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.560]   It's a huge miserable show.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   It's unmanageable.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.640]   You mean for as a unmanageable, the town is deteriorated and it's terrible and as traffic
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.120]   is ridiculous.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.920]   And they're, they're building more now ever since when put up this new building and then
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   filled it up.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.400]   They all these other one, I'd say followers that, you know, whatever Steve Wind does,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   let's do that after he, you know, he succeeds or fails.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.880]   And then that's where the whole town's being built up again, like never before.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.080]   There's a thing being built across from the Latin Hotel called Project City Center, which
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:55.360]   is a, which is a city, a literal city they're going to build with condos, its own fire department,
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.000]   its own police department, $9 billion project.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.160]   I mean, it's just completely out of control.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.400]   And what has to happen at CES more than anything else is they've got the spin off the computer
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.440]   stuff and make a second show because this show is completely useless as it exists.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.840]   And the point of view of a computer trade show or just as a consumer show.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.040]   Oh, no, it's a, why spin off the computers?
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.120]   That seems like the smallest part of it.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   Computer stuff added there.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.360]   It is on we'll be, but this year I'm not saying that they did the one thing they did, which
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.280]   was they moved to the high end audio stuff.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.880]   They used to be at a hotel, a hotel called Lexus Park and it was really far away.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.000]   And I never, I, in five years, I never made it there because it was just too far, but
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.680]   they should because the other convention was starting later in the week.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.560]   I guess they took the Venetian.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.360]   So it was a little bit more convenient the way you managed to cover some of that.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.000]   Did you go to the high end on you?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.320]   I didn't make it, but my team made it over there.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.560]   They had some pretty, you know, they always have insane stuff over there.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   $200,000 speaker.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.080]   Well, that's, it always blows me away.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.120]   Who is buying $200,000 speakers?
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.200]   I mean, what the problem with it, the reason I'm glad I didn't go was because when I
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.320]   leave those places, I want to destroy my own stereo equipment because it sounds so bad.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.120]   It spoils you.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:16.960]   Yeah, if you look at what the trend is, I mean, the very real trend now is thanks to the iPod
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.760]   and MP3s, it starts crappy audio.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.360]   I mean, most people aren't listening to high fidelity anymore.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   They're listening to MP3s.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.480]   You know, I had a couple of years ago, in fact, I had a meeting with Mission Electronics
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.120]   about this exact same issue and they were like moaning and groaning about, you know, they
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   have to make their money selling computers for computer systems because their normal
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   high-end stuff, the regular big speakers that we used to like to, you know, we kind of
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.280]   lusted after when we were in college.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.520]   Nobody's using these things anymore.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.760]   These kids are listening to crap and make it worse as there's all these little devices
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.040]   that you can plug an iPod into, which have two crappy speakers hooked to it.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.560]   Sounds like just some, like somebody killing a duck.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   It's unbelievable.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.560]   Nobody cares.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   They're happy with it.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   They're gaffed.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.560]   That's why.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.120]   Do you think, do you think that demographics have anything to do with this?
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.720]   I hear that, you know, now more than half the world lives in cities and we're all living
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   in tighter quarters.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.040]   I know that when someone asks me, would you like somewhere to, actually, I'm doing a talk
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.920]   for a hardware manufacturer and they asked me if they could pay me in hardware and, you
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.600]   know, they make big, rack-mounted servers.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.520]   I don't have anywhere to put a big rack-mounted server, you know.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.920]   Hey, they're cheap, Corey.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.720]   They use rack mounts.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.080]   Yeah, but I mean, but when you say if you're listening to--
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.320]   Oh, let's-- if Cliff's offered to give you a big pair of clipshorns, you couldn't use
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   those either.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   Where the hell would I put them?
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   I can-- I can use them.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.720]   Yeah, you live in a mansion.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   You live in a state--
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   Yeah, you own the island of Port Angeles.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.880]   I mean, I live in London most of the time, right?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.720]   And you know, when I left, there were three of us living in three adults living in about
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.320]   480 square feet.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.120]   We all listen to headphones now, really.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   I'm a nomad, man.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.280]   I don't even buy three and a half-inch hard drives anymore.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   There was at CES, I understand, a subwoofer that was so, so strong and actually had to
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.720]   be bolted to the floor, otherwise it would start to walk across the floor.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.080]   Well, you know, you're-- I mean, that's not a new thing.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.120]   Years ago, they used to have these things-- in fact, they did again this year.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.120]   But what--
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   Kicker or whatever they call it?
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.280]   Well, no, yeah, there's-- but they have these car speakers that they bring in.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.760]   You know, Foz Gain, one of these companies, they got like 30,000 watts in a car and they
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.280]   turn out and blows the windows out of the car and the car's jumping around.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.720]   Well, and you can hear these guys coming down the street when they use those.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   What is the appeal of that?
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   I don't understand.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   It doesn't it deafening?
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   I think they're deaf.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.320]   Isn't there internal organ damage that would be caused by something like that?
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320]   I don't know.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.120]   I put a subwoofer on my car.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.120]   I don't know.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.120]   I don't like it, but--
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.320]   Do you drive down the street going--
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.520]   Well, no, I tried to be good about it.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.720]   I mean, on the freeway, I will, but not in--
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   Interesting.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.840]   Like, legendary, because it keeps me nice.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.400]   I think it might be-- I think it might be the Atkins diet, right?
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.480]   Like, if you eat a very, very high meat diet and you really got to keep your colon moving
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.080]   and you need a technical assist, you need the bowel loosener.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   That'll do it.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   That's--
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   Let me write that down.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.360]   I got to trademark that bowel loosener.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   That's an all loosener.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   It's a good name for a speaker.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   The bowel loosener.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   It is a good name for a speaker.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.200]   You thought the butt taker was tougher.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.160]   You need the bowel loosener.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.080]   I've had a friend grow up.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.400]   I've had a friend grow up from that because I--
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   She really--
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.760]   Yeah, the subwoofer was against the back seat.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   Oh, my God.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760]   And he was getting in the back.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.080]   He was running his stomach all day for a few hours.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   It's awful.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   It's a little much.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   Yeah, I'd estimate it's a little much.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.840]   The people are the amount of good money.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.000]   One of the big stories--
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Yeah, the talk.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   One of the big stories, of course.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.440]   In fact, maybe the bigger story at CES this year is HD, particularly HD DVD versus Blu-ray.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.320]   LG Electronics announced a dual format player, one of the best it showed from CES.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.560]   Was that the most important device there, John?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.880]   Well, I think most people would think so.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.880]   I mean, the one thing--
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   Did you see it?
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.880]   Do they have one?
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   No, it was there.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.720]   It looked like it was, but who knows?
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.400]   I mean, we've been to these shows before.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   You never know what's really going on.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   But it seemed to be working.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.680]   And they had a huge--
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.080]   I mean, it was just a big-- it had a-- basically, it was the showcase piece at the LG booth,
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   which is a large booth.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.760]   But the thing is, I'm still skeptical.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.840]   I'm not seeing-- until I actually see one in my hands, I'm not going to make any--
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.560]   I'm not going to believe it, because I still think there's licensing issues.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   Did they announce a price, Han?
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.360]   Did they say how much it was going to be?
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.360]   It was $1,200.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.360]   $1,200.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   OK.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.680]   So basically, you can buy both.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.520]   You can buy the Blu-ray and the HD DVD separately, and they do the same price.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.520]   That's right.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.240]   Well, do you think we'll come down, or is that kind of the--
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   All right.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.040]   Yeah, it will eventually come down, but it's just--
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   That's right.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.520]   I hate the two formats.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.360]   I just think it's stupid.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.600]   I think they've been-- we've been down this road before.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   And they should get rid of it.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.760]   And on the flip, Warner Brothers, I heard, was working on making a disc that plays in
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.760]   both.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   Right.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   So what's going to happen when that comes down?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.360]   I was a clear winner.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.160]   Remember earlier, I declared that HD DVD was going to pull ahead this year.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   That was my prediction for the year.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.280]   And now, boy, here we are 12 days in, and I am right, because the porn industry has
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.240]   just announced that it's going to use HD DVD, that they don't feel welcome on the Sony platform.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.240]   That's a huge platform.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240]   That's all over, baby.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   Is that a huge, brother?
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   Was that a huge, brother?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:49.600]   Was that a
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.480]   that to me. I mean, that one stroke, so to speak, could do it.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.860]   Yeah, here's what the problem is, though. We need some new device for our computers,
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.380]   and Blu-Ray is more appropriate.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:07.540]   I'm reluctant to bring this up, because I know Corey will start steaming out of his ears,
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:12.580]   but that's what you're seeing with these VISTs. We just talked about it on Windows Weekly,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.200]   and security, now, is the Peter Gutman article about what they've done to VISTA to make it
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.480]   capable of playing back premium content. I presume everybody's going to end up having
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   to do this.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   Just really crippled.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.160]   Yeah, I think you've nailed it there. I think that the thing to remember about both
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.720]   of these is that implementing either of them requires that you go and get a license from
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:38.320]   the folks who run AACS. Those people don't want computers that can do anything their
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:44.040]   owners ask them to do. They want computers that only do things within some realm of permitted
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.680]   activities, and they want to be sure that you can't modify your computer. As a result,
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.640]   they're raising the cost of computers astronomically, introducing lots and lots of new failure modes,
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   sucking up huge amounts of CPU cycles just to make sure that you're not doing anything
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.200]   naughty with your own computer, and making them harder and harder to use in connection
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.840]   with free and open-source software.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.080]   Which one should people pick? I sincerely hope that they pick YouTube.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.200]   The swing box is getting a lot of traction. YouTube gets crazy traffic. A lot of people
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.440]   are still okay with watching lower quality, in a way lower quality than broadcast.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:28.680]   Apple TV sports high def. I think you're a C device that supports high def. Of course,
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.760]   that's through Apple's DRM and through Apple's own iTunes. You're not really getting away
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.120]   from the content protection.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.200]   We just got through having this discussion about how people are more than willing to accept
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:48.680]   lower quality MP3s for higher flexibility. I was at conferences 10 years ago, where the
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.520]   every music executive in the room said exactly the same thing. MP3 will die because the music
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.960]   quality isn't high enough. They were 100% wrong. It turns out that freedom is more valuable
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.240]   than bit density. People may go out and buy an HD DVD player.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.000]   Right now, I have an HD DVD player, but it's a 1/100 of the content I can see.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.840]   Wait, hold on a second on this debate. One of the things, they did say that. There was
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.600]   a bunch of people, but there were also a lot of audio files saying this too. From the get-go,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.400]   especially if you went to a bit rate that was just a little bit higher than 96, the
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:35.040]   quality wasn't that bad on MP3s. I think that from the get-go, the quality of MP3s was surprisingly
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.840]   good. Especially when you consider the fact that most of the source material people would
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.120]   be playing would be stuff like a Rolling Stones album, which has crappy quality. Anyway, the
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.600]   music impressed. It sounds like garbage.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.840]   The current state of DVD, if you have good upscaling, looks pretty good on a high deficit. HD looks
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.600]   better, but is it enough better for people to... Yeah, I think it is.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.920]   It is enough better.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.080]   I think it depends on the movie, because Sony's favorite demo of Blu-ray is always "How to
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:13.720]   Flying Daggers." The way it's shot, most of the background is out of focus anyway. It's
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   a sharper blurriness. I don't like well... Who cares?
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.880]   Exactly. It doesn't really... The way the movie's made, I think, play a big part.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.160]   I think it's a projector. When you blow it up to 100 inches, you end up...
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.760]   Oh, you see it there. You see the difference.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.600]   Yeah, but how many people are blowing it up that big?
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.640]   Well, there's enough of them. But the fact is that you can blow it up pretty big. I'm
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:40.240]   not even running 1920 stuff. It's just a 720p kind of a thing. It looks really good at 100
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.000]   inches, but I suppose if it did 200 inches, it wouldn't look as good.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.640]   I guess the question is, are the manufacturers selling lots more tiny screens or lots more
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.040]   giant screens?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.000]   I think you're asking the answer is lots more tiny screens.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.320]   Interesting. Well, I think they're selling a lot. I think big ones, because rear projection
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.520]   and all that stuff is huge and the prices are pretty affordable.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.760]   I think a lot of them... I think you all you have to do is to see the real trend in the
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.640]   country is to go to Costco. I mean, that's pretty much... They don't even have any,
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.200]   except for some small LCDs that are like 20,000 inches.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.320]   Well, but I would also say people are buying all kinds. I mean, they're watching video on
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.160]   their phones, they're watching video on their computers.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.600]   Yeah, that's what I mean. Everybody sitting down and watching...
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.280]   Well, there's different experiences. My name is Earl on their phone. I don't think it's
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.320]   hidden or not. Well, they're not, but that's just bad news for people to make feature films,
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.160]   because what they are doing, it's kind of like the debate about ebooks, right?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.920]   People say, "Well, no one reads off of screens." Well, that's empirically untrue.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.360]   You, me and everyone we know spend every hour godsend sitting in front of a screen
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.040]   and we're still reading novels on screen. We're not more on the day.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.120]   That's right. We read shorter form works, and it's not that all those works are factual,
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.640]   or none of them are entertaining. But a medium that is as multi-purpose, as a computer,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.840]   demands things that require shorter attention spans to consume.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.920]   I have to say that. In the same way that a handheld device does.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   Looking at the iPhone, and if Apple comes out with a, and I'm sure they will, an iPod in the
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.000]   same form factor, that looks pretty good. I'd watch a movie on that. In a lot of situations,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.200]   not at all. But Leo, I think you're making a mistake. You're mistaking the screen quality for
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.560]   the thing that affects your viewing experience, and it's not. It's the context. So when you've got a
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.080]   room or a TV, by definition, you have a room with a table on it, with a TV on top of it,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.040]   and a sofa. People don't walk into that room and just start talking to you. Whereas an iPod is
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.840]   something you hold in your hand while you move through the world. So yeah, maybe you would. But
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.360]   if you were in a place where you could just sit down and watch a screen apart from an airplane or
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   the occasional hotel room, chances are you're at home. You already have a room where you can
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.520]   watch on a screen. In the same way that people say, "Oh, well, I'm really pointing out that we
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.000]   all want a palette of screens. We don't want just one screen. We want the screen that fits what
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.960]   we're doing right now." And sometimes it's all the ones already. We already have the palette of
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.480]   screens, but I'm not going to be watching movies on some little handheld device, unless it's an
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.560]   emergency. I will. And I say that, Leo, but you won't. Oh, I do all the time. I just bought two more
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.640]   movies in the iTunes movie store. Well, I believe that you won't, John, but I don't think that
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.400]   that's to say that you won't be watching video on little screens. Oh, I watch quite a bit of
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.440]   TV. Well, I know you're right, Corey. And in fact, I do occasionally watch a clip
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.040]   or something on a little screen. It's always kind of fascinating. It's kind of cool.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.200]   But I'm not going to sit there for two hours. And in fact, here's an example. I think I've told
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.360]   this anecdote before on the show here, which is I was on an airplane recently. And there's
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.600]   everybody up and down the aisle is one of those people. Everybody had a laptop. And there were
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.440]   a lot of them were watching movies, a lot of them were playing "Solitare." But you could just go up
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.560]   and down. It's amazing the number of people who still play "Solitare," but you're absolutely right.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.160]   Yeah, I know it's especially the lousy "Solitare." But anyway, so I saw all these people. And there
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.320]   were some dweeb in the back holding a little bitty video iPod, watching a movie. And he looked
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:55.120]   like an idiot. That was probably me. I watch the current iPod. I'm talking about a newer large screen
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:00.480]   iPod. It still looks stupid. If I were in the entertainment industry, the thing that I'd be
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.240]   worried about now is not whether or not people are ripping off movies to watch some on iPods.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.560]   It's whether or not in a world where most of the screens that we interact with are that small.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.680]   There's any room for a feature film anymore. It's not that people don't watch a lot of video.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.960]   I mean, I figured out when I got a Tivo that most of the stuff I've been watching, I've been
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.360]   watching because nothing else was on. And so now I got to just good stuff. And then after a few
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.000]   years with a Tivo, I realized I didn't even want to watch Tivo anymore. Now nine out of 10 video
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.120]   moments I have are in front of a computer and they're tiny little clips.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.960]   I think there's lots of people want to see feature films. Look at how many big screen TVs
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.360]   you're selling. I mean, that's the point I think we have to, Corey has to answer. Yeah, if you're
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:45.200]   stuck in a apartment with 400 square feet, three people. But if you have like, and which makes me
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.760]   wonder what you're doing with all your money, the living in London. Oh, yeah. Never mind. Never mind.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.680]   You know, it costs four pounds to ride the subway in London. Can you believe that? No, we call it
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.920]   the tube. Four pounds to ride the tube. Yes. Yes. Like a couple hundred bucks. What is that?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.200]   But they throw in about 73 portrait photos while you're on it with all those CCTV's.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.320]   So it's kind of a deal if you think about like deducting the cost of going to the Sears
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.120]   Portrait Studio. So I believe it. Oh my god. But anyway, so everything's really a
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.960]   chip over there. But the point is that if you do have a big room that you could put a projector
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.520]   in or a large screen TV, you will watch movies. I watch them all the time. I love it. It looks
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   great on a big screen. Maybe it's just because I got too much on my plate. But I find that like
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:37.200]   the 90 minute uninterrupted time blocks are times that I don't usually have in the house. Like,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.600]   even if I set 90 minutes aside, the phones ringing, there's always, you know, the sense that there's
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.680]   some email coming in and I should go attend to it. I love going to the cinema. You know, now that
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.440]   I'm spending a year in Los Angeles, and this is the land of giant movie palaces and
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.400]   going to Grownman's Chinese and seeing a movie on that giant screen is totally awesome. Yeah,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.560]   even crummy movies are awesome on that screen. But not in the house anymore.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.920]   Better screens in London, but they have big giant screens there.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.000]   Well, but John, here's the question. Do you ever like bring your laptop into the living room while
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.440]   you're watching TV? Never. What? Really? I do. Wow. I live with my laptop and my lap.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.640]   No, I don't. I don't know anyone who doesn't anymore pretty much except you.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.560]   Like my, I was a guy. I was in Florida seeing my grandparents at Christmas and my grandmother's
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.280]   boyfriend watches TV. It replaced, it's replaced the TV tray now. Yeah, I just have the laptop.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:30.160]   You know, it's not that I've never had the laptop in the in the family room watching TV.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.200]   It's just that I generally don't. I have, in fact, I usually don't even use my laptop.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.000]   I mean, I've got big machines all over the house. And if I, you know, if I come up to the
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.400]   office for the where the computers are, I'm going to be doing work on these computers.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.880]   Or geeks. I mean, I don't know if we are a bellwether for what America is going to be doing.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.200]   I mean, maybe your grandparents are. You don't think short and attention spans are like a
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.280]   trend in America? I kind of think about, you know, the ring cycle, right? People going to a three
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.400]   day opera. That's not only with you on that, there's no doubt about it that the shorter
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.560]   attention spans a big trend. Well, I don't think that means I have to be having to have a laptop in
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:12.400]   the. It's good for YouTube. So speaking of speaking of big screens, a sharp got a lot of
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.680]   attention with the world's largest LCD. I've seen reports that was 100 inches and 108 inches.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.880]   Well, how big was it? 108. That's huge. 100 eight.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:27.440]   It was good. I stood next to you. It was absolute. It was bad.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.280]   It's like I got a sunburn on my left arm. Right standing next to the thing.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.480]   It's literally priceless. I mean, they didn't, they didn't come up with a price for.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.920]   That's $70,000 there. Oh, you could buy it. All right. Hey, let me add Robert
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.960]   Harris. We're going to start talking about TVs. I mean, there's nobody who knows better
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   than Robert Heron about this stuff. And I know he was probably covering it.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.200]   But the point is that now they can do LCD screens that are much, I mean, I know for a long time,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.240]   we thought you couldn't make them that big. Hey, Robert Heron. Welcome to a twit.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.160]   Hey, can you guys hear me? We can hear you. Great. Corey, John,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.280]   C to Vorak and Hey, Han, Joy from Indigital. And since we got Robert Heron here,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   because I remember him being on cranky geeks once and he brought, we came up with this little
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.440]   argument about the SED television. What happened? Supposedly.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.800]   It's shifting any man. Now somebody sent me an email and said it's a lawsuit. It's not dead,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.600]   but that a Canon and Toshiba are being sued by somebody. Right. And John probably knows something
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.560]   about the company that has a patent related to the either the carbon nanotube technology or the
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.000]   field in missive technology. There's something there's a company I believe in the Midwest.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.840]   That is. So isn't that why the SED wasn't at CES? Yeah, right. It could very well be. But in my
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.520]   opinion, after what I've seen in terms of what the plasma guys are doing and in terms of the
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.800]   LED or the LCD guys, it's too late. It is simply too late at this point.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.640]   It's a nano proprietary, a perfect name for a company that's suing over nanotube technology.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.160]   It sounds more like a licensing issue, really. It sure does. If you name a company,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.760]   hi, we're nano proprietary. That's pretty much there to be to sue people, don't you think?
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.000]   Are they patent trolls? Are they just people? They actually look no, no, they have technologies
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.560]   actually believe it or not. It had something to do with Canon having Canon. It's a sheba. They split
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:20.400]   the SED incorporated 59% and or a 50 49% and 51% and it turned out that the party that had the
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.240]   49% had licensing agreement with this company. And because of the way the agreement worked out,
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.200]   they just didn't feel like it was a legit use of their patent. Canon wasn't supposed to share it
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.680]   with Toshiba. Exactly. Right. Right. Right. Something weird like that. Yeah, they have a
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   but it doesn't tell like a deal killer, but I'll be on like I say, though, some of the
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.480]   new TV technologies. So in particular, the plasma guys, uh, kind of are pioneer in particular was
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.200]   just doing wonderful things and they were shown off technology that literally when it's released
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.680]   the summer, it'll come as close as it needs to. You know why that is? You know why that is because
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.480]   I just bought a pioneer plasma TV. That's exactly for you. That's exactly for you, Leo. They say,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.600]   oh, by the way, you got to buy more stuff so we can move technology along.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.440]   Don't feel so bad. I can't believe what'd you buy? I just bought the, uh, what is it? 46 inch
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:14.320]   sharp 1080p and I just saw the new 120 Hertz models and the next generation after that. It's no
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.920]   longer how many P's it is. It's how many Hertz it is. Yep. And for the, for the LCD guys, yes,
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   you can't win. We were talking about the, uh, the sharp 108 inch LCD. I mean, obviously that's
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.560]   outrageous, but does it mean that they've gotten better at making big panels? Yeah, that's, that's
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.760]   really the showcase piece for their new eighth generation plant in Japan right now. It's remarkable.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.480]   They actually had a good comparison showing the quote unquote motherglass of their eighth
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.640]   generation plant where they can cut, I believe it's a 652 inch panels. Did they say how many they
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.520]   had to throw out to get 108 inch that worked? Yeah, they had three of them there. I don't think
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.360]   they had compared to like the plasma guys in terms of shipping and logistics of moving a panel
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.160]   like that. They were able to have three there, whereas with Panasonic and their launch of the 103
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.680]   inch plasma had a single panel at the show. Right. And yeah, you know, I was at the, um,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.640]   they had a dog and pony show in San Francisco with a Panasonic with one of those big,
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.560]   they had a hundred inch, uh, a plasma and you know, it's just beautiful. Uh, it's not really that
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.720]   much better than the projector, but it is has its moments in the, in the bright light. That's for
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   sure. But I asked the guys about this. I just thought of, you know, well, how do you get, how do
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.400]   you install one of these things? He says, for one thing you have to have if you don't have to,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.200]   you don't take off the roof. Is that you? You don't have access of forklift access
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.800]   for starters. You can't install it. That's why Bill Gates's house has had special double door in the
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:44.880]   back. You drive a forklift right in. You say, cause these things weigh 10, it has to be professionally
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.320]   installed. Actually, you know, anything over 50 inches is becomes a problem. Yeah. Panasonic
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.800]   gave it told me a story about how one, one famous basketball player who had put on, was put on the
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.880]   prelist and ordered one ahead of time. They were trying to figure out the exact weight of the
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   103 inch panel so they could figure out how they were going to, they were going to basically mount
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.080]   it in the ceiling. So it would come down on a motorized lift and that has to be at least four,
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:14.880]   500 pounds of weight. So you know what the precursor to all of this stuff is the, um, the
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.720]   haunted mansion in Disneyland, there's that ballroom scene where there are all the ghosts dancing
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.000]   in the middle of the ballroom. That's accomplished with a thing called Peppers Ghost and they have
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.960]   a sheet of glass that you can't see, very polished glass that divides the ballroom horizontally
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.040]   right in front of you and the ghosts are reflected in it and they had to build the haunted mansion
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.560]   around it. So that's like the world's biggest T uh, you know, LCD. Yeah. And, and someone shot a
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:43.520]   BB through it in the 70s and, um, there's a spider web there now. They put a spider web over the cracks.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.200]   You couldn't, they couldn't put a new one in. They would have had to open the roots.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.920]   Allerias. Oh, yeah. I'll have to, this is shot of TV. So, so,
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.480]   if you can't TV a OLED technology though, that's on me. We're showing off. That was beautiful.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:02.880]   Million to one contrast ratio, something crazy. It just means the black was unmeasurable, but I
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   got OLED faded over time. That was the, over a few months. Well, that's remains to be seen.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.640]   It was blue that would wear up before all the other colors are red, blue and green. The blue
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.360]   would wear out soonest. So Sony had no information in terms of, you know, exactly what they're showing
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.280]   off art in terms of when it would be available or if it would be available this year even,
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.240]   but they did show off a 27 inch panel that was 1080p and arguably one of the most delicious
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.360]   looking displays there. Full motion video, very well saturated colors that that black
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:39.680]   little gives the million to one contrast ratio. Say again, say again on it. It was a centimeter.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:46.320]   Think of something. Exactly. A centimeter thick, the whole thing. Yeah. 27, either 22 or 27 inches
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.800]   play with a similar. How big can they get OLEDs? I mean, I'd only seen little ones up to now.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.080]   I swear. I will. I'm only in the mid-cell phone. So, I think we're getting as big as anything.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.040]   There's no reason they can't make them huge. As big as anything. Well, not as big as the
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:06.320]   Ritz hotel, but you could make them pretty big. I thought Samsung had a prototype at 40 inches
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.960]   already, but that wasn't at the show. But Sony's was just delicious. It was really one of the
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.800]   neatest looking displays there. And they had a dozen of the smaller 11 inch displays surrounding
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.880]   that 27 inch version. I always like to tell LED. Before the show, last week on
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.680]   Twit, Bill McCrone was singing the praises of Velkos. He said he really liked the JVC,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.720]   D-I-L-A, Elkos. What's the state of Elkos at the show, Robert?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.960]   No signs of slowing down. That and DLP are the two prominent micro display technologies that
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.000]   are used in projection systems, either rear projection or front projection.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.200]   So, when you're talking about OE-L-E-D and LCD and plasma,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:47.760]   it's really, right now, it's DLP, Elkos, LCD and plasma that are kind of the dominant.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.520]   Exactly. One of the two main display types, as far as flat panels go, the only two really are
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.040]   the LCD and the plasma. And then for your rear projection stuff,
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:04.400]   LCD rear projection isn't nearly as strong as DLP. DLP has that market pretty much cornered.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:10.080]   And with Elkos coming up behind. And from the studies I've seen and from my own eyes,
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.800]   I would say that Elkos has an advantage in terms of cinema quality, but DLP is able to hit great
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.920]   pricing right now. And neither side is slowing down in terms of innovation. My local movie theater
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.600]   just put in DLP projectors and they look fantastic, even on giant movie screens.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:29.760]   I had a chance to see that final Star Wars movie in 1080p or the new 2K DLP projectors.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.960]   And that was arguably one of the most beautiful looking screens I'd ever seen.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.120]   I've heard with Star Wars movies, the best thing is to turn the audio over to Italian and pretend
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.840]   they're opera. Or just start playing the Wizard of Oz at the same time and see if it syncs up.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.920]   So your local movie theater, are they doing that thing where they're adjusting what is on
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   which screen dynamically, now that they've got digital projectors? What do you mean?
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.360]   I don't understand. Because that's kind of the big promise, right? People like you just keep a
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.680]   couple of screens as floaters. You don't schedule anything in them. And then if you oversell
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:08.000]   Police Academy 17, you stick it on screen 7. And you just suddenly have another cinema that can do
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.960]   it. Or you change the reels, you know, you do a showing at one of movie one.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.760]   Since it's all digital, yeah, you don't have to carry these big film reels around.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.200]   Just change what reel you're showing.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.520]   It's easy to do. Yeah. I haven't gone enough to notice whether they're moving the
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.960]   hopping the theaters around. But I guess they could. And you, of course, as with all
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.280]   Cineplexes now, they have some little ones, some big ones. But there have been almost all of them
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.560]   are deal piece screens now. That's something brand new. They just started doing.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:37.440]   So for so any any, you know, go ahead, I'm just to say that's probably the screens was probably
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.240]   the main thing going on at that show. I mean, there are some interesting junk that was in the back
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.480]   of the US. Tell them to tell me about some of these USB devices. No, I mean, there's just a bunch
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.600]   of USB and you know, sushi that looks like you. Yeah, we end up. But they had a bunch. There
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.960]   were some weird trend that was that there was at least three of these things I saw. And some
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.760]   people saw some other ones. There were a slew and I guess there's a new circuit out or there must
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:06.400]   be some new chip or there might be a mem or something of breathalyzers for drunk drivers.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:13.200]   There was a there was a combination iPod player breathalyzer. There was a coin operated breathalyzer
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.360]   that you could put at your bar. There's just a bunch of them. I was just going, what did they
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.760]   get? How accurate these handheld breathalyzers are though? I mean, I don't know. But that seemed
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.040]   like one of the weird little things in the US. How about GPS? Was there a lot of GPS stuff there?
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:31.600]   Anything new in GPS? I thought couple. I thought couple things. I love this. We talked about the
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:37.520]   new V. David Prager got the 680 or yeah. And that's a that's pretty slick. It's pretty
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:44.640]   like there's a new one from Dash navigation has one that's it's got a GPRS and and Wi-Fi built in.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:50.480]   So you can actually search Yahoo. They have Yahoo search built into it. And then it communicates
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.680]   both ways. So if your car slows down, apparently they locked out any kind of way to identify who's
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.960]   doing what. But if your traffic slows out, send it to the network so that other people will know
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.880]   that there's traffic. So you're screwed. You're stuck in traffic. But the people behind you would
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:11.360]   be okay. Or they know there's something going on. So it's kind of an interesting way of using the
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:18.160]   two-way communication. So all you need to do if you want to reserve highway 101 down Silicon Valley
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.720]   for your own personal use is to set a beacon at one end that says my speed is five miles per hour.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.120]   And then everyone else is directed away from the road. Yeah, exactly. That's good idea. Send
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.520]   someone ahead of you to go really slow. Hack them. If there's a system, it will be hacked.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:41.280]   We talked already about SED Robert and the conclusion was that the fact that SED wasn't at CES didn't
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.720]   have much to do with the lawsuit had more to do with the fact that the technology just lost Robert.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.160]   Shoot. Just as I was asking a question to you.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.920]   You such an SED promoter that he had to hang up. Maybe that was it. I was going to put him on the
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.600]   spot while I'm trying to reconnect with him. Well, we're taking a break. I like to thank a few
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.000]   people out there for sending me some Appalachian. Did you get some stuff? Yeah, I got it. I got
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.240]   I wanted Greg Guffi sent me one really good one. One of the better ones actually has the back-to-back
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:15.600]   stuff on it. He's at sent point dot com. And then Brad Cochran, who was wanting me to promote his
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:25.120]   site. He's pushing a French singer named Ali Zay. And he's got Ali Zay, USA dot com as a website.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.440]   He says, if I plugged that, it would send me a shirt. He sent me the classic Appalachian state
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.320]   one. Oh, yeah. Oh, so you already got a shirt. That's good. All right. I was going to say. Yeah.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.880]   Leo McKenzie, the third whom solo computer services I want to thank him to and also this.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.560]   There's maybe one more that Corey, you missed all this, but John has a new scam now where he's
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.760]   basically getting all his clothing from a list of free clothing. We can't take free equipment.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.480]   You know, we can't take one of those Acer laptops from Microsoft. Did Boing Boing get
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:58.240]   offered an Acer laptop? No, well, not as far as I know. I didn't. Did you, John? Did you know?
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.840]   No, I never, nobody even mentioned him. That was a big scandal. Although, I don't know if it is a
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.680]   scandal. I mean, it's for bloggers. Wasn't it for like bloggers? Yeah. Well, you got a blog,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.040]   isn't that? Don't you have a blog? Yes. Oh, by the way, there's one more guy, Sean,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.240]   Sean Moore at homegauge.com. He needs it. Thanks. Boy, John, you must be liking this stuff because
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.920]   you missed a completely great opportunity to say devorect.org/blog. Oh, you mean, I didn't say
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:27.040]   devorect.org/blog. I was plugging somebody else's blog. Yes. That's unusual. I don't know. I'm sick.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.880]   I'm going to have to be having some kitchen, something. But I'll tell you two days in Las Vegas
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.800]   and you get chapped lips. I tell you, I am so glad not to go to Las Vegas. I used to get sick
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.920]   every single day. Amen, brother. Oh, hallelujah. Did you used to go Corey to cover that? Oh, yeah.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:47.520]   I used to go for EFF and we still have a booth. I used to go for EFF. God, it was brutal. And,
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.760]   of course, when you go for a booth duty, I mean, that's the worst. Oh, yeah. And you end up staying
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   in places like that. What was it called? Like the concrete bunker motel near the circus circus
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   that was just one interesting thing in Vegas that you use the star dust is boarded up now.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.360]   What? They said, thanks for 45 years and they're going to blow it up. Well, they've got to find
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.080]   a Hollywood movie that needs a casino blown up. And once they make oceans 14, they'll be,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.480]   they can blow it up. Unbelievable. We got Robert back. Welcome back, Robert. I was going to put
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.680]   you on the spot here. Thank you. Please do so. You've been a big supporter of SED televisions.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.440]   SED conspicuously absence from CES this year. Is it the lawsuit or is it the fact that John as
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.520]   John Avers that the SED is dead? D E D? In my opinion, after what I've seen this year,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.040]   I agree with John. It's simply too late. I don't believe that they'll ever be able to catch up at
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.440]   this point to what the plans are doing or the LCD guys are doing. That's one of the things,
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:50.000]   but you know, I have not seen one of these displays, but everyone who's seen them, they go on and on
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.240]   about how great it was like a painting on the wall. I find that hard to believe.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.040]   Not really was, but after what's the best picture out there right now? I mean,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.680]   any technology, just the best look in picture.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.240]   Tough to say for general all around do everything right. It would be
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:14.640]   El cos in terms of the big screens at high performance. Second would be plasma.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.600]   And how about these LEDs? So they look as good as El cos.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.720]   OLDs in a whole other class. I mean, that just that was amazing. It was like perfect black,
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.800]   which is what the big advantage that SED has in terms of extremely high contrast ratios,
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.200]   very well saturated color. But it's there's just too many unknowns. I mean, we don't even know how
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.640]   much they're going to cost when they'll be available. It would be nice if Sony gives a hint. But
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.960]   and as John pointed out earlier, it was the longevity issue with certain colors involved in
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:48.160]   pen and in particular blue. If blue wears out after a thousand hours, nobody's going for that.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.760]   But I imagine that was like a year ago.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.640]   When they're having something that the camera, you know, this is a chemistry issue that these
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.680]   guys have with these OLDs. And I have heard nothing that indicates that they've solved this
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.880]   problem. But the who's in Oz and it was a solid crowd at the Sony booth just to stare at those
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:11.440]   13 displays they had on. That's yet another reason not to go to CES is because they show off
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.600]   stuff that they either can't make or can't make it a reasonable cost and everybody who's in Oz.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.000]   But you're seeing stuff that's just not going to happen.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.440]   That's true. But they also showed off some fairly impressive 70 inch bros.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.480]   Yeah. You go to a car show and you see stuff that never is going to go on a car show.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.760]   People who in all but yet I went to Mac world Expo and boy there it was the iPhone man.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:39.680]   That is incredible. And which will come out in which will come out in June if the FCC approves it.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:44.000]   I have to say the funniest thing and they had two iPhones in Bell jars, right? That's it.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.760]   And you can't touch it. And to see the geeks lined around in a circle with literally with
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.600]   their mouths open just gaping. Yeah, you think it was Einstein's brain or Lenin's tomb.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:02.560]   Yeah, maybe that's a more apt description. Paul Thoreau of Windows Weekly said it was like when
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.160]   he stood behind the Venus de Milo and took a picture of the tourists looking at that.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:14.320]   It's that same kind of slack jawed appreciation. Hey, is there any truth to that story I saw
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.160]   briefly? It was either through Associated Press or Newsvine where they were saying Apple was forced
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.400]   to rename the iPhone to the iTouch mobile. You know, is that just complete B.S. or?
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.280]   I saw a number of stories which were then yanked about that. Of course, Cisco is suing them.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:33.600]   And I have to say I don't see any reason why they can't rename it to something else like the
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.080]   Apple phone. Look, they took the ITV and made it the Apple TV. Why not take the iPhone and make it
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   the Apple phone? The J phone. The J phone. Why J? J phone because it's what comes after i.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.480]   It's one more than i. Well, I thought it had something to do with jerking off.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.720]   How about the now I'm going to have to bleep that John. Come on now.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:59.840]   I think somebody actually owns J phone. Probably every letter in the alphabet is the
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:05.600]   all of the phones switch switch alphabats man the Omega phone. There you go. We got to go Greek.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:12.240]   Olive the first phone in the alphabet. I don't know. Do some memos of feet.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:18.400]   Do they see the power cast technology that they were showing off? John, you said that was good.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.280]   That was one of the things in our last week's episode that you said you wanted to look at.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.240]   Well, was it again? I'm sorry. The power the HD power technology.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.640]   I don't remember. Power line networking. Oh, yeah.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.680]   There I saw nothing. I couldn't find it. So what were you talking about then, Han?
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.720]   Oh, this is the ability to send power over our over our over our over our
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   ass. Oh, yeah. There's that. I apologize out there. Did you get to see somebody? Did you get to
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.280]   see somebody doing it? Yeah, I actually went to the Mandalay Bay and they had to do their
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.560]   working with Phillips on it, but they didn't have a space for me to see it. So I went to
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:00.800]   Mandalay Bay and saw it in other suites. Unbelievable technology. I couldn't believe it. It's 900
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.920]   megahertz frequency. This guy, Nikolai Tesla was demonstrating his hair was standing on it. It was
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.840]   actually a number of years ago to tell you right technology festival. There was somebody using
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:17.120]   Tesla's old technique for doing that. And it was in the street and they had a guy across the street
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.240]   and they had this light bulb sitting there on one side of the street and then it would light up
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.080]   for some, you know, it wasn't hooked to anything and it wasn't a magic trick that I could tell.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.520]   That's a good graph. And they had this guy beaming over the juice from across the street.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.760]   So there must be some, you know, killer problem with this though, that's keeping it from.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.320]   Yes, Tom Edison didn't like it. Really? Is that it? Well, supposedly, that's it, right?
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.720]   Supposedly it was all like Tom Edison. Well, Tom Edison arranged to burn it.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:47.440]   That was a lab and that was DC versus DC. Yeah, Edison's been dead for a while. Let's,
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.720]   you know, maybe we can revisit this. Well, Edison didn't like any of this.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.640]   Tom, it worked. Does it look like it was working?
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.000]   Yeah, basically, you know, it's not going to, like say, your cell phone, it won't charge your
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.920]   phone necessarily, but what they'll do is they'll stop it from draining. So you, if you have a
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.240]   charger, they'll just maintain it at that level type of thing. There are FCC regulations on how
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:11.440]   much power they can send. But they're basically harvesting the 900, 900 megatort spectrum.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:18.560]   They have a receiver and a transmitter and they convert 50% of the waves into energy.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.600]   And the idea is to integrate this up into mobile devices. So that, and like things like wireless
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.800]   keyboard, you know, and you just have a transmitter right next to your desk and they'll just charge
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.640]   it. And you know, they're, they're, they have to see the rules apparently are kind of strange.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:39.440]   Like it's like one milliwatt up to a meter. But if you shield it as in like, put it in a desk,
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.480]   you can put, you can put more power up. So you can have like a metal desk and have a lot of power
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.240]   rolling around in the drawer and you just put stuff in there and slam the door closed.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.280]   One example was an electronic toy box for like little, you know, kids toys. They just open up
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.000]   the box, drop their toys and they'll charge it. I think Corey, this is a premise for another
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.480]   short story, Corey. That's right. We do accept that people have been predicting this for too long.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:11.200]   Oh yeah. It's like flying cars. Oh, the demo. The demonstration was impressive. You know,
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:16.320]   they just, they turned on that they had a lamp with a, with a transmitter in it and a bunch of
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.200]   LEDs around and with this, their, the receiver chip. And basically you turn on the lamp and these
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.600]   things light up. Now if it turns out that these things jam arfits, that would be a great science
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:32.480]   fiction story. Suddenly, yeah, if you have two competing technologies in different camps that
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.440]   really want this to succeed and eat both equally powerful in Congress, now you've got something.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.240]   Maybe that's all you I see. Sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say I did manage to get my hands on a
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.640]   company's product called Wild Charger, a company called Wild Charger and they were doing wire-free
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.360]   power delivery into their demo was with cell phones. And basically it's a pad you just lay your
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:57.040]   devices on and it connects to that without any, any hard connection. Yeah.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:02.400]   Electric toothbrushes that do that. This was not using. Yeah, this wasn't using a field or
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.640]   anything like that. Like my toothbrush does the same thing, but this was actually just a, it was a,
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.680]   it was a kind of proprietary connection, but it wasn't actually using a wire per se. And it was
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.440]   working actually. Yeah, they saw that running just fine. Yeah, they had been fed through like
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:19.600]   something, a chip or something in the battery and then you just dropped down the mat. But
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.360]   they, you know, we, we'd seen, I'd seen something like that like a few years ago and it never
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.240]   came to market, but this thing was no mat, nothing else. It's like, wow. Like I, one of the
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.120]   examples they should show to the Christmas tree, you just put the Christmas tree.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:37.360]   Just put it in the field and scramble your eggs too. If you just put a little play to eggs right
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:43.840]   there. Yeah. It was amazing. It's in the spectrum. They're using 900. So technically if you're on
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:49.200]   say on a cordless phone, you would actually add energy to the field. It's kind of weird.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:55.760]   Right. So bizarre. So there's a lot of better, there's some battery technologies that were kind
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:02.240]   of interesting. There was, I saw a hybrid nickel metal hydride that would actually hold the charge.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.280]   So you could actually sell batteries and you could actually sell them at the store charge
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.360]   because you know, they, they normally. That's been a big problem with nickel,
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:14.160]   metal hydride. They leak. Yeah, they drain fast. And this seems to protect against that.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.200]   And then the other one, which I couldn't get much information out of because I went to the
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.880]   Chinese pavilions. There was a couple of them there. There was one from Taiwan and there was the
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:26.240]   PRC pavilions. And nobody spoke any English. I mean to an extreme itself, almost as though,
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.760]   I know they speak good. There's a lot of Chinese that speak really good English in China, but they
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.640]   didn't ship any of those people over here because it's a boondoggle apparently. And so you didn't
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:40.080]   get any information. So you have party hacks that came out. These guys could say yes, okay.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:46.800]   And best price. And then they could say many patents. That was it for the vocabulary.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.680]   That's funny. That's what Steve Jobs said too. Many patents.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.920]   Many patents. But anyway, so it was an important tagline to his keynote speech was, and we've got
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:59.520]   200 patents to stay away from the iPhone. They had a water battery. Somehow it was a double
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:04.000]   A battery that you put water into it and it would act. Wow. Wow. But it didn't mean that
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.640]   patents. I didn't know how it worked. I couldn't find any patents. Yes, we sell it cheap. Any other
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.480]   translation service at the beginning at the front entrance of the North Hall. I think there's
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.680]   actually a translation booth. Maybe you have to hire somebody and take them over there.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.680]   They wouldn't help. How on a scale on a scale of one to five in terms of excitement and and
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   stuff you learned was how was this CES? Robert Heron was it a big five or was it kind of a hand?
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:34.720]   I'd say it was a four. It also just it seemed awfully crowded though this year. And even though
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.640]   I guess attendance wasn't quite as big as predicted, but it sure felt that way.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:45.200]   And even though they had 35 football fields worth of stuff. I'm I'm stuff. I question the
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.000]   attendance figures. You thought it was bigger than they were saying?
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.400]   Yeah, I don't know why. But I would not undersell it. That's true. I get to suspect. I'm
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:58.560]   I suspect that they're lying on the on the low side for their attendance figures because I'm
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.280]   in totally agreement with Robert. This place was jammed. And I've seen big shows before and they're
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.360]   telling us 140,000. This had to be at least 200, 300,000 even. Wow. And I think it's for you
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:14.000]   because of the unions or there's some something that we don't know about that they're giving these
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.280]   low numbers. I really don't believe these numbers. Breaks to every every blogger on the planet was
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.400]   there as far as I could tell. Yes, they let that's because this year they loosened up their
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:29.760]   requirements. Anyone who wanted to get a press. I want to get my press pass. I showed no idea
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:35.200]   whatsoever. If you show up if you showed up, you would have gotten in well, that's complete
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.280]   opposite of Mac world, which was hardly crowded at all. And you could in many, many people were
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:44.800]   turned away. Many bloggers. I don't know. On Sunday, there happened to be a series of press
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.080]   conferences that were being held by some of the high definition folks. And in particular,
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.640]   the Toshiba conference was the one that just went ballistic. I estimated just to get into the
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.440]   meeting room for this this public show, there was at least 1000 people in line for this room that
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:02.560]   might have held half that many. And I never saw so many upset people and just almost bordering on
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:07.280]   chaos. And it really it's really getting to the point where any company that's going to plan on
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:12.000]   doing that in the future really has to consider doing it by invitation only because it was too much.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.720]   Okay, giving some picks for unusual and cool things that you saw there, Han Shui. What was
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.880]   your favorite thing that you saw? My favorite thing. I don't know.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:30.240]   PC for your car. And usually people make these boxes that make fun. This thing with a built in,
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   like self enclosed unit fits into your dashboard. They have a little kit keyboard that would come
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.160]   out. And so you could be like night rider and.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.720]   Well, they're a touchscreen, but as Bluetooth Wi-Fi and all that, so you can use it with the
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.920]   Wi-Fi Bluetooth keyboard. But obviously, you know, it all gets walked out if you're going over
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:53.600]   three miles per hour, which makes them. Were you impressed by the Ford announcement that Microsoft
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:59.040]   were going to sync with Ford or something like that? Yeah, that syncs the technology is that
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:04.000]   by voice recognition stuff, right? And to control navigation, all that. And you know,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.960]   Microsoft has been talking about for a long time. And personally, I've never had much success with
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.920]   voice recognition. The speech to the recognition stuff doesn't work for me.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.720]   You talk funny. Yeah, I do talk funny and things got to learn. You know, maybe,
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:26.240]   you say I'm Ford and not people talk. I understand. I don't know about that.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:31.040]   Yeah, I think a lot of it. I have to do with your range where your frequencies
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:37.360]   are in your voice. People that have a, that are tenors that have a lot of mid range and high end
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.240]   in their voices. The voice recognition works great. Jerry Parnell, he's got like kind of a high
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   pitch voice and he has no problem. I have a kind of a basic voice that has funny overtones and I
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.080]   have nothing but trouble. Jerry told us that the reason the handwriting recognition works so well
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:57.120]   on tablet PC is it's based on his handwriting. Maybe they did the same thing with the voice recognition.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   Oh yeah, tablet PC never works for me. But Jerry, they literally used his handwriting as a template
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:09.440]   and he says, "Oh, it recognizes me, right?" I think there might be a generation gap thing too
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.320]   because like, I just, I basically was typing around the time I was learning to write cursively.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:20.720]   You know, we had a terminal, a teletype terminal in the house in '77. I was like six and so I was
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.560]   typing and writing cursively and I just stopped writing cursively and went back to typing.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.720]   And I can't read my own handwriting. And you know, whereas Jerry probably got to start writing
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:35.360]   manuscripts long hand. You're right. Exactly. Like, you know, with Stevenson. With one of those
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:40.320]   birds, right, hammering the thing into the stone tablet looking up going, "That's a living!"
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:48.320]   Very flintstones. How about, how about you, John? What would you say was the coolest thing you saw at
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:53.280]   CSA? It's a good lot of stuff. But you know, the water battery was kind of cool. The breathalyzer
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:59.680]   MP3 player was kind of funny. There was a very unique, I thought it was kind of an interesting
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:04.240]   guy who had set up for a disc jockey. I'm going to probably write this up. I don't have
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.640]   any company name handy, but it's another one of these things from Taiwan. It was an apple
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.840]   iPod thing. It slipped into this little box and on the box there was all these scratch pads and
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:20.560]   all these things that DJs use at discos that created that you could use the iPod to like run the disco
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.600]   music. And then you could have all this ancillary stuff and, you know, sliders and all these weird
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.120]   things that these guys use. And DJs actually kind of need it. I would love to bring a couple of
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:34.640]   iPods instead of 800 pounds of records, I'm sure. Yep. Well, most of the yeah, like I was
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.880]   bringing hard. Robert, you got it. You got to pick? You know what, this might sound kind of odd,
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.160]   but I'd have to say it's part of the spec of HDMI. It started with version 1.2 and it's called
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.520]   consumer electronic control, CEC. And you're going to see this on a lot of new TVs and set top
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:56.240]   devices. Pretty much if you can connect the TV to a CEC enabled, say DVD player and your CEC
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.080]   enabled set top box be a cable or satellite, you need one remote control that can then communicate
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.240]   through those through those connections and control all of those devices at once rather than
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.240]   having to program a universal remote to do that. That was just one little usability thing that
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.640]   just struck me as finally seeing products that are taking advantage of the features of that spec.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.800]   Will it be in a TV, you think? Or where do they put it? But it's just, but it's part of the spec
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.400]   and as long as the device supports that, they can then communicate with each other. And then
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.320]   that way, if you if your remote already has those controls for other devices on there,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.720]   it's literally an open standard. It doesn't require direct support, although the manufacturers would
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.360]   tell you that last. It's like, well, of course, it'll work with our, you know, brand X player and
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.080]   brand X TV, but it'll also work with brand Y as well. But, you know, but that was just nice.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.920]   It was something coming up that it'll just make it easier for everyone to say, hey, you know what,
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.240]   I hooked up my DVD player and my TV. And I don't need two remotes to control them both.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.720]   How about you, Han? Anything you'd like to end with?
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.840]   Well, I want to say something because I'm going to add this as one of my favorite products because
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:04.320]   John hated it. I was about cranky geeks and he hate, I brought it on. He hated it. It was a
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.960]   karaoke thing for you like, I thought it was cool. Oh, so you say, well, yeah, sure. Yeah.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:15.600]   Well, you got the amplifier. Yeah. It's not cool. I don't know. I just, I just, you actually, you
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.520]   could use the CDs, like the karaoke disc that you buy. But, you know, it actually also acts as
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.960]   a pass through. So you can pass your video on to and your audio on to the screen. So you dock it and,
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:33.200]   you know, that way you can kind of serve two purposes. And I enjoyed it. I had a lot of fun with this.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.240]   Corey, you and I were blessedly away from Las Vegas. So I'm not going to put you on the spot unless
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:45.120]   you saw something in the news that you thought was worth. No, no, no, you know, I like had my, my
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:50.240]   great technology moment last year when I got to Singapore and I went to Simlin Square and found all
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.720]   this great stuff that like wasn't actually for sale anywhere. I couldn't find it on the web later.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.680]   It was just, just stuff that I guess little outfits were trying out in the stalls markets there.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.280]   And that stuff was really badass. All these crazy MP3 players that were going on.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.440]   Forget CES. Let's all go to Singapore next year.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.920]   Now let's go to Simlin Square. Sounds good to me.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.880]   Yeah, I agree. That area's got all kinds of cool stuff. And you can actually in Malaysia and all
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.720]   those areas have like these kinds of places with all this weird stuff that's made in them in the
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.680]   Southeast Asia and Taiwan. I thought a big announcement, although I wonder if you guys saw anything,
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.360]   was a sling media's announcement of the sling catcher, which sounded like that was cool.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.680]   A very cool box, a $200 box that basically took any kind of media. It's kind of the reverse of a
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.000]   sling box. Instead of the sling box takes your media puts it out on the net so you can see
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.960]   wherever you are. This would take media off the net and put it on your TV locally.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.400]   I thought that was really cool. But apparently you can take that box and travel with it too,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.040]   so you're the hotel. Give both. Yeah. Oh, hey, I got it. Yeah.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.840]   I got it. That's without the PC. So I thought that was pretty cool. And then the other thing I
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:57.760]   actually saw, I really like it was this company called the Mo-Gill mouth. It's a PC car. It's a
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.800]   little tiny mouth that fits into your PC card slot and charges Bluetooth mouth. Oh, that's cool.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:08.000]   And you pull it out and you use it. Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's a little stand. You know,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.760]   obviously it's so flat and you know, it's uncomfortable, but they have a little stand to
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.000]   kind of prop it up and make it feel like a mouth. But if you're not into touch pads and stuff,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.600]   like, you know, using it constantly, especially if you're doing spreadsheets and stuff, it's
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.360]   kind of complicated. So I like to throw a mic for that. Yeah, I like that too.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.360]   It has a little bit of mechanism, didn't it? Just to give it a little height. Nice.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.440]   You could give it a little height in your palm. It's a on the PC express card version. It's like
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:42.960]   scroll pad in the middle and left and right. So I really liked it. That was really cool. Cool
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   use of a small like, I guess, it's an old technology in a way. It's just a mouth,
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.800]   let's face it, but I like it. So I had there was one cultural thing I should report. Yes.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.200]   They, you know, I there was a press room and there was also a thing called the blog house
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:07.360]   H. H. H. H. H. S. That was the and the blog house was for bloggers and the press room was
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.600]   for obviously normal press all their, you know, there was a mixture. And who did you hang out
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:17.680]   with Mr. Dohorak? I had we PC magazine, we had our own room and so I hung out with them.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:22.080]   But I did visit both of these things and the which one smell better. Yeah, that's the real
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:29.680]   question. You know what the blog house smells probably. It wasn't like, but you see this all.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.880]   No, that's actually there was interesting because you had a,
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.720]   that was, let's just put it this way, the energy in the blog house compared to the energy in the
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:44.720]   press room was a lot more dynamic. It was better because they were just happy to be out of the
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   house. They were. And it was open 24/7. Wow. The press room was only open until six o'clock.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.840]   And so I mean, you see, you know, I mean, it was a very interesting cultural difference and
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.400]   the people just at the blog room, even though a lot of them were just goofing around, it was,
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:03.120]   it was just seemed like a much more energetic group. Very cool. Well, there's one other story
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:08.480]   that wasn't a CES or Mac world story, but I have to bring it up. Pirate Bay is trying to buy an
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.960]   island so they can be a sovereign nation. And I have to worry about the RIAA. Corey,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.360]   I saw this in Boing Boing.net. Yeah, they're offering citizenship too.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.320]   Oh, let's move, baby. Well, first you have to donate to them and then you can, then you could be
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.920]   a citizen. That's right. Well, I kicked in some money. I think that's a hilarious idea. I don't
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:35.440]   know. I mean, ultimately, other nations have discovered that no nation is an island. You know,
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.720]   Somalia, one point at the urging of the State Department, their entire internet connection
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.920]   was just switched off one day because it because they wanted to do something to do with terrorists.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.640]   I remember the Bahamas were putting in a fiber line from the mainland because they wanted to be a
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:56.960]   data haven, much as much the way they were a pirate haven in the last century or the last two centuries.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.160]   I mean, lots of people try this. I guess Sea Land would have the advantage that it wouldn't have
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:09.360]   any exports except for bits. So the big issue right now with nations is that if you have any
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:14.240]   exports, chances are you remember the World Trade Organization. And if you remember the WTO and you
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.720]   don't adopt Americans' top copyright rules, they can block your exports of everything else.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.480]   If you're a Burundi, you've got to pay market price for pharmaceuticals and not make your own
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.000]   AIDS drugs or you won't be able to export your sorghum. So that's more or less, well,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.880]   you know, the kind of world as it is today. And I think the thing that as a science
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.160]   fiction writer, this holds out the possibility of a country that just exports bits.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:46.800]   So this is actually a platform. It's not even an island. It's a gunning platform,
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.760]   gunnery platform out in the middle of the... There's tons of islands, like they're evacuating
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.560]   all these islands in the South Pacific that are disappearing because of rising oceans,
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.880]   because of global warming. And if all you need is a patch of sovereign dirt, I mean,
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.880]   like those islands, they kind of have two assets now. They have their top-level domains,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:12.240]   so like 2volu.tv. And then they have their sovereignty, which I guess someone might want
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.800]   to buy and use for this kind of thing.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.880]   Dot S-E-A. I'm liking it.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.720]   Sea Land.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.520]   But buysealand.com if you'd like to help.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.880]   It would have to be two letters though. So I don't know if SL is taken.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.160]   SL is the...
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.840]   S-E we know is taken.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   SL is F-U-Taken.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.840]   F-U, that's good.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.320]   Or dot PB for Pirate Bay.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.120]   There you go. All right. I like the... This is... You know, it's like those old pirate radio stations
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.560]   that floated around like Radio Caroline and on ships off the coast of England.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.480]   I like the idea.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:48.960]   I hope they do it.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.280]   Just cut off their connection. There's no way that they can manage.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.040]   I mean, even if these guys have got...
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.960]   They just take an axe to the fiber, right?
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.280]   But they don't need to actually have to come from there, right?
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.520]   Is that... Would they have to actually put their servers on the planet?
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.760]   Well, that's the idea is to just have physical jurisdiction questions that are hard.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.520]   I mean, as I understand it, right now after the Pirate Bay's servers got taken down,
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:14.960]   when the MPA had a member of prevalence, we didn't illegally intervene to have their servers taken down,
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.680]   they relocated mirrored servers in three jurisdictions.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   I think one is in the former Soviet Union, one is somewhere in the European lowlands,
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.000]   and one is in Scandinavia, and they can just change the DNS.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.080]   And so the idea is to have hard jurisdictional questions
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.960]   that would confront anyone trying to affect a takedown notice.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.200]   But if you can affect a takedown notice on the ISP, then you've got another question entirely.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.000]   Well, I guess that...
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.880]   I guess that's what they can target their advertisers.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.920]   What I would expect to see is a big giant gunboat with the Sony logo on the side,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.880]   just sitting off the shore, they're blasting away at these guys and declaring a war and
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.480]   putting people that have the passports on this operation like yourself in an internment camp.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.880]   That would be an interesting turn of events, wouldn't it?
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.520]   Now, I see a story coming on.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.880]   This might be part of the next collection.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.680]   Corey Doctorow's new short story collection just out.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.400]   Overclock stories of the future present.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.440]   You're going to be doing a book tour, a little mini book tour, starting in Toronto, February 1st.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.560]   That's right.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.120]   At Baca Books, the science fiction bookstore on Queen Street,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.400]   and then I'm going to be doing one at Borderlands in San Francisco on the 8th.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:39.920]   Also, details TBD, Vancouver, San Diego, Duke University, and I'm leaving one out, but that's okay.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.000]   So, yeah, a bunch of places that I'm going to be anyways,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.120]   and so I've got local booksellers who are going to run a little launch for me,
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.560]   and so that's going to be really fun.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.640]   I love Borderlands. I'm not Borderlands.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.600]   Well, actually, I love Borderlands.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.160]   Baca too.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.080]   I go to Baca every time I'm in Toronto.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.480]   I love it.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.040]   You know, and so many science fiction writers have worked there over the years,
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.520]   as me and Tanya Haff and Michelle Sagara and many other SF writers now,
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.680]   Alahawkanson, who work there over the years.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.840]   So, it's really cool to be able to continue doing stuff with them.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.840]   There's actually a great photo of me at 12 with a little 12-year-old Mohawk
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.440]   and giant cheeks at the book signing for Charles Delint and Steve Sterling in 1983.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.960]   Where's that picture? I want to see that.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.480]   It's hanging on the wall at Baca.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.760]   Oh, I'm going to go in next week.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.120]   Ask it to show it to you next time you're there.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.880]   Yeah, I'm going to be there next week.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.000]   And of course, the book is free for download, as always,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.400]   and the stories, you know, won lots of awards and up for more awards.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.000]   When was up for the Hugo Award last year?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.560]   One's just got picked for the year's best science fiction, so I think they're good stories.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.440]   I've podcast all of them so you can download the audio too.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:43.520]   So, it's multimedia extravaganza over there at Crafthound.com/overclock/
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.760]   What's your earl again, John?
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.040]   It's @block.org/blockup.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040]   That's her right.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.760]   I can't wait to see the book and I wish you luck with the launch.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.520]   I'm going to head over to revision3.com because that's where the home theater showdown is going on
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   within digital. Jessica and Will Wheaton and of course, Han Choi.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.400]   Fighting it out over there.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.440]   You had $5,000 right, Han, to make the ideal home.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.240]   Yeah, $5,000 each.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.080]   And you went with plasma, I think, yes?
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.920]   No, I went with the LCD.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.480]   LCD, that's right.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:18.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.240]   But you were the only reason the plasma and 1080p plazas are so expensive and they're the LCD.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.840]   So, that's why I went that way.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   And then you did your results, sir, isn't it?
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.160]   The results are in?
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.680]   Yes.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.960]   But he's not happy about them.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.600]   Yeah, you don't.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.000]   All right.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:34.400]   Reveal.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.160]   Well, yeah, I'm not happy with that, though.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.200]   That wasn't good.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.160]   You know where I am now.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.120]   Was Patrick, my decision, the one that won?
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.040]   Did we pick the winner?
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.360]   Well, you have to watch the show to see.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:49.600]   Okay.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.280]   But all I know is it unfair.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.600]   I did make the recount.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.600]   There's a definitely a hanging chat issue here.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.320]   I'm telling you.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.000]   I love the cross-pollination here.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.640]   So, Robert, you and Patrick were judges in this?
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.120]   And we selected a winner.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.720]   But I'm not sure if that's the final winner.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.640]   If there were additional judges involved,
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.600]   we'll have to see, I guess.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.960]   We'll just have to watch and see.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   Yeah. So, Patrick and Robert said what they thought
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.360]   were the best and then the viewer got to vote
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.280]   and also entered out to win the system.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.880]   And so, those two, those tallies came in.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.680]   And the person that won,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.080]   the person that won my advice system,
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.840]   the thing, what bothered me was the fact
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.920]   that we gave all these three systems away.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.760]   And the people that voted,
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.360]   not one of them or the runner-ups had voted for me.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.600]   I voted for you.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.560]   And I'm like, that's not fair.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.440]   I liked you, sir.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.960]   I thought it looked spectacular.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.360]   It was genius, but no, I evidently have won.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.640]   The worst stuff, but it wasn't you.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.680]   Well, all I could say is that just shows you
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.840]   what you can do with $8 million in venture funding.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.800]   I think that's more than we ever gave away on tech.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.400]   TV, revision3.com.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.280]   If you want to watch Robert and Patrick at work,
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.480]   dl.tv, that's where you'll find Robert Herron.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.000]   It's great to get you back on Twitch, Robert.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.200]   It's good to hear from you again.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.080]   It's good to be back.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:06.880]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.320]   JohnC.Divorak.org/blog, of course, to read John's postings.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.080]   And if you want to see him on camera,
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.560]   crankygeeks.com is his--
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.520]   I'm also on CNBC on Wednesday about quarter to 12.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.080]   How could that?
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.440]   Is that a new thing or is it?
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.000]   Ooh, I've been doing it for about two or three months.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.920]   They put me on as a regular now,
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.440]   just kind of making analysis.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.720]   I'm on for like a minute.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.840]   Well, I'm going to call you Robert,
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.840]   because I'm doing Regis and Kelly at the end of the month.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.360]   And I'm going to show him big screen TVs.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.000]   I want to get--
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.640]   see if I get that sharp 108 inch LCD.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.560]   Make Regis really--
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.520]   Are you someone to move it?
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.000]   Need a forklift, right?
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:42.800]   It's too massive.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.880]   It's so big for you, Reg.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.520]   It's literally-- it's bigger than a queen-sized bed.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.240]   It's not so.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.400]   I want to get that one and then get the giant plasma,
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.000]   and it will just take up the whole set.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.920]   There'll be no room for anything else.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.560]   Matthew McConaughey will just have to leave that day.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.440]   The plasma guys are really making 1080p displays.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.120]   It's the largest size is affordable,
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.440]   and that's what's really coming up here in the next six months.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.120]   Now, when I bought that Pioneer, it's not--
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:07.840]   it's 1080i.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.120]   Did I make a big mistake?
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.000]   No, no.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.320]   Pioneer makes the best looking plasma
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.440]   displays in the world right now.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.480]   They don't make the biggest thing.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.280]   They don't make the cheapest.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.400]   They just simply make the best,
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.000]   and they've been doing it longer than anyone.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.280]   I like how it looks, I got to say.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.120]   I didn't get the Elite Edition,
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.000]   because I don't feel Elite.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.280]   I got the Ploebi Edition.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.480]   It's still great.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.520]   It's still great.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.720]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.080]   We'll see you guys.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.680]   Another twin is in the can.
