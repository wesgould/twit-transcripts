[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   fresh from his kimchi exposure in Korea.

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   on the fine revision 3.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   >> Is there something about that particular spot that just attracts a certain type?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   >> Mostly, in fact, it's too pendously expensive.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, that could be it.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> John C. Devorect, we're talking about this before the show starts and says,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "Brunch, why don't they get rid of that?"
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   That's a classic, John.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   What do you got against brunch?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's Mother's Day, people are going to brunch.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   >> You know, it's about time that we gave up on brunch.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We don't need another meal during the day.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And brunch is just like...
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   >> It's not just other meal, but it's just like a few meal replacements.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   >> It's fewer meals.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   >> At least I used to.

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I never come out before and I may lose a lot of my fans.

[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   >> You know, I'm not a big fan of that either.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I do have a burrito once and a while from them, but it's not really a burrito.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's more just beans and tortilla.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, Taco Bell's not exactly Mexican food.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> No, but anyway, the point is, yeah, no, I've always found brunch to be annoying.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> Here's a great story where there's no brunch involved because you never get out of bed.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> But is there tech?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> Yes, it's NASA.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   NASA's technology.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   This is from, and it's from the Wired blog.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It says, "Pack your bags for Houston because NASA wants to pay you $17,000 to stay in bed for 90 days."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's the bedrest experiment at the Human Test Subject Facility.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Isn't that a little aperture science, the Human Test Subject Facility at the Johnson Space Center?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   >> It sounds a bit cryptic, doesn't it?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I'm not sure entirely that I'd want to go anywhere near.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> This is the best part.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So Wired Magazine asks the questions we all want to know.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   They said, "Can you play World of Warcraft while you're lying in bed?"
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   >> No, that's a good question.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> I mean, if you could do that, it wouldn't be so bad.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> I can imagine a lot of guys going for that.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> It says, "Can you bring a PS3 or Xbox 360?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   There's already a game system in the TV unit.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's a bad sign.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   That means it's like a Nintendo."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And Super NES or something.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> A game system?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah, that sounds like a--
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   >> There are no conjugal visits.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You can take visitors, but you may not--
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   They don't want you to do anything because they're testing, I guess, lack of activity.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   >> Sorry.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   NASA, conjugal visits.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's just a little bit of code.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> Hey, next time you're at the brunch, you might want to mention this.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> Yeah, I'm be staying over at the human test subject facility.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Come on by.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Say hi.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> No conjugation, though.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> No conjugation allowed.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   You do have to pass an Air Force medical examination, take a blood test, and you must lie prone for
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   2,160 hours.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   There may be some bone loss.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> I'm going straight.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> When you get 17 grand, $5,000 a month, baby!
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   >> Seven some bone loss.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> That's great.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> But there may be some bone loss.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's for really lazy people.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> My bone!
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Gone!
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   >> Let's see.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You're in Korea.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   What were you doing in Korea, John?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   >> I was at the Seoul Digital Forum, 2008.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   >> Is that a trade show?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   >> No, it's like a-- it's a Gabfest.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You know, it's like one of those things where they put a bunch of people up on the stage and ask stupid questions, and they have--
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   but they have a lot of heavy hitters.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Sumner Redstone was one of the keynoters, and I got the chat with him.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   >> Sumner Redstone, the crazy guy that owns Viacom.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   >> Koot.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   >> Koot is the word that leaps to mind.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   He probably enjoys brunch.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> A fine show.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   >> You know, he probably does.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   >> He's a mimosa drinker.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   >> Also, like the head of the guy was the head of the Methuselah Project.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   That guy says you're going to live to be 1,500 years old.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   >> That's not-- you're not taking Ray Kurzweil, another guy?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> No, that was a guy with a long beard.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   He's British.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   >> He has a long beard.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Of course he does.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   >> He's got this beard.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I swear to God, it's done.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It was ankles.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   >> He looks like he's trying to look like Methuselah.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   >> Is that part of the secret?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   >> And you know what?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   There's a whole bunch of people that were there, our friend from Chuck E. Cheese and--
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> Nolan Bushnell.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   >> Game.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Nolan Bushnell was there with Al-Alcorn, who was also there.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Who was interesting.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   >> Who's Al-Alcorn?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That's familiar.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.520]   >> Al-Alcorn was the co-founder of Atari and also worked with Nolan on a bunch of different
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   things.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.760]   And anyone who became an Apple Fellow, he's largely responsible for the development of
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760]   QuickTime.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   >> Oh.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   >> Very nice guy.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   I don't think I've ever met him.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.440]   I mean, maybe I did, but I don't remember.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.680]   And we kind of hung out together and got along fine.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.400]   And Gina Smith was there.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.480]   >> Oh, Gina, what's she doing there?
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   >> She was there to head a panel on Genomics or some crap.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.920]   >> Oh, yeah, because she wrote a book on Genomics.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.480]   >> And I guess who was there that was a real shocker, Mark Edo.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   >> Mark Edo.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.480]   >> Yeah, Mark Edo.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.040]   >> Used to work at Tech TV.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.840]   >> Yeah, that Mark Edo.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.240]   >> He had a British accent.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   >> Big thinkers.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240]   >> Big thinkers.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   What was he doing there?
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.520]   >> Of course, then I took over the show.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.080]   It became big stinkers.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.680]   >> You know what we've got to set in the new Twit Cottage, just for you.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   It's a fireplace.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.320]   We've got wing chairs, we've got a little flickering fire light, you and a big thinker.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.280]   It'll be great.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.320]   If you ever want to, I don't bring back that triangulation or big thinkers, you just come
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   up here.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.520]   >> Yeah, well, like we can do that.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.920]   We can do some stuff.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.440]   Anyway, and there's a bunch of, it was just, it was a fun event.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.520]   It was very interesting.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:49.720]   And I also got to go into Seoul and I've got some tailor-made suit and they--
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   >> How much did that go?
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.920]   >> I just got to go into some tailor-made shirt.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.360]   >> Turn yourself up a little, Patrick, so that you can overwhelm John.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.240]   >> And the one thing that's interesting, I have this shirt design that I've been working
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.880]   on for years because every time I go to Asia, I get some more shirts made.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.560]   And now I've decided I've got the pockets.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.840]   They're huge.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.320]   They're designed for this, they have two pockets and each one of them is just big enough to
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.880]   perfectly hold a jewel case with a CD in it.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.800]   Everybody thinks it's so nerdy.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   >> The suits.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.040]   >> The suits were 300 and the sport coat was 250.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.200]   >> Wow, so they're actually getting expensive over there.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.880]   >> And how much for the shirts with the giant pockets?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.640]   >> The shirt, well, you had the shirt made any way you want with dinky pockets, giant
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.240]   pockets, whatever, but the shirts are at $35.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.560]   >> Well, that's not bad.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.840]   >> No, they used to be 18 and the suit used to be 200.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.320]   >> So, so do they give you an option for giant pockets?
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.040]   >> No, you just tell them exactly what you want.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.880]   I got like, you know, specific things and you have a sample shirt.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.560]   And then I take the sample shirt and I say, here's what, you know, which is modified every
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   time I go.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.400]   And then I say, here I want these pockets to be, you know, bigger now because I want them
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.480]   to hold this, you know, jewel case and make the pockets bigger.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.280]   And then the next time I do it out, that pocket will be done deal.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280]   I'll make some other modifications.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.200]   >> Yeah, next time you'll go, I want to big enough to hold an EPC.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.400]   >> Is there a wife says, "This holds a bowling ball."
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.520]   >> So, anyway, so everybody thinks I'm like really nerdy for getting these big giant pockets,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   but you know, looks kind of cool, actually.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   >> Does it?
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   I'd like to see how that looks.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.960]   >> Yeah, you'd be surprised.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.840]   >> Have you cut your hair yet, John?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.400]   I cut my hair if I went to Korea so I didn't get, you know, dead.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   >> Because I saw last week's cranky geeks and it was looking at menstruation.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.720]   >> You had some serious hair on cranky geeks.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   >> Crank, it was a mullet.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   >> It was a mullet.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.560]   >> It was almost thick.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.360]   >> I think mullet's are-- >> First, I thought when that opening sequence
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.720]   came on and I was just like, holy muck, mullets.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.160]   >> I think mullets are great.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.000]   I think everyone should have a mullet.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.280]   Anyway, I'll post the name of the tailor I went.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   >> I think that sounds pretty cool.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   >> It is cool.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.880]   In fact, if you're going to be there, why not?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.480]   I mean, you know, somebody's flying over somewhere they can get a suit.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.680]   >> So, I don't get why they fly these people to Korea to do this event.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   I don't even understand.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   And the choices they made were interesting.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.280]   >> Well, there's a whole bunch of people.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.800]   You can usually see that list that's online.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.880]   >> Is this kind of to promote the notion of Korea as a tech republic or?
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.120]   And the ideas that we're supposed to be talking to the Koreans saying, hey, you can do this,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120]   you can do that.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.120]   And the president from Korea showed up.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.840]   And I got to shake his hand, which I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.120]   But what was funny, when he sat down, I was sitting with Gina Smith and I had this great
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.600]   idea for Gina for a publicity stunt.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   She wouldn't do it though.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.720]   But anyway, she was sitting there and he was sitting where on the other side of the room.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.920]   I told her what she should do is get up and run toward the president, pass his bodyguards
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.280]   as fast as she could, screaming free to bet.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.200]   >> You're confused.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.480]   That's out the other way.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.720]   >> Oh, how funny.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   >> I see.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   >> That would have been fun.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.560]   >> It's always good to get a picture.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   >> She wouldn't do it.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   >> Shot.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.640]   >> Say again, say again, Patrick?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   >> So it's always good to get a business acquaintance shot.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.360]   >> We got on the news.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.480]   >> Yeah, the problem is the whole idea of publicity is you're going to be alive to benefit
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.680]   from it afterwards.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   >> Confused.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.000]   >> Or at least not imprisoned.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.360]   >> A confused tech reporter causes international incident.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.200]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.560]   >> Actually, that was one that really, I had quite a good one of those a while ago, where
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.800]   I was at an Intel event, and Intel had this big thing where they had the CEO and they
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.520]   were inviting in, really being pleased.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.760]   It was the first major Chinese delegation that they'd had to one of their conferences.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.360]   And so the CEO of Intel was taking these questions afterwards.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.520]   And I stood up and I went on the wireless that they had and I found like Intel's corporate
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   ethics policy.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.440]   And it was all about how Intel approves of free speech and how Intel embraces the rights
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   of self-determination for its employees and all these kind of things.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.800]   Like I said to the CEO of Intel, how do you feel that your esteemed guests from China
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.320]   measure up to your own corporate policies?
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.600]   And you asked that?
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.560]   You have some guts, man.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   >> Troublemaker.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   >> And it was hilarious because every of the journalists in the press room was shaking
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   my hand.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.120]   I was like, oh, that was awesome.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.520]   >> Yes, because you got the question.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.920]   >> You asked the question.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.400]   >> I didn't get invited to the next event.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.840]   Did they un-evite you or did you just not get invited?
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.040]   >> No, I was quite pointedly left off the list.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:43.000]   >> I have a policy of assuming that whatever I get invited to, I'll never get invited back.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.640]   >> That's good.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.040]   >> And with that policy in mind, you can do whatever you feel like because if anything
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.640]   is whether you do anything or not, you generally don't get invited back anyway.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.520]   >> Well, they already had their fill of view, now they're going to move on.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   >> Right.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.040]   >> Is that a place like your neighbor's barbecue and stuff?
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   John just turns up.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.280]   >> Hey, you were about that fence.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.360]   >> Hey, brunch, can I have some bacon?
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.000]   >> As long as it's not brunch, I will show up.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.040]   >> There's an interesting, somebody put this on our delicious feed.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.160]   And if you want to submit stories for Twit, God knows we need them.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   Just bookmark something on delicious.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160]   Good.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   >> I'm yet a few.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.040]   >> Just bookmark something on delicious and use the tag for colon Twit and that way I
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.720]   will see it.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   And we can add it.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.400]   But here's an interesting article.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.960]   I don't know what to think of this.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.840]   The Gem Report, J-E-M.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.360]   I don't know this guy, Gem Matt Zann.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.440]   But he is complaining about the ethics of O'Reilly.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.720]   >> Oh yeah.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.160]   >> Did you see this, John?
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.720]   So he says that here's this is a tech book called Subject to Change.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.680]   It's written by four people from Adaptive Path, which is a very well-known web design
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.440]   company in San Francisco.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.560]   Apparently the logo is everywhere.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.600]   The author speaks in first person.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.880]   And basically the content is a pitch for Adaptive Path.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.520]   It's basically a brochure in the guise of a book.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:21.560]   >> Now that may be a subjective opinion from this guy.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.600]   I haven't read the book.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   But it's an interesting question.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.560]   I mean, in a way that's what 37 Signals did with their book.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.280]   It was called Getting Real or Stay Real or Keeping It Real or I can't remember what it
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   was called.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   >> So what the--
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.400]   >> The problem is, well they're trying to sell this as an editorial book and it's an
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.120]   ad for Adaptive Path.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.680]   >> Well, there's other issues going on with O'Reilly too, which is suing everybody over
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.360]   this web 2.0 moniker.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   >> Well, that's another story that's kind of interesting.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.240]   I don't think this is Tim.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.600]   It may not even be O'Reilly proper, it might just be their attorneys, but they're trying
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.520]   to protect the word web 2.0 because they have a web 2.0 conference.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.760]   And if anybody tries to do a web 2.0 anything, they say, "You can't.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.600]   We own it."
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:15.720]   It's like Walt Mossberg saying, "We own the letter D. You can't have it."
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.440]   Walt has never done that, by the way.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.000]   >> He could have it.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.360]   >> The letter D brought to you by Walt.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.680]   All right, well I just thought I'd raise that.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   That's one of the--
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   >> I don't know.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.560]   I mean, it's this guy disappointed that it's O'Reilly?
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.080]   >> Well, do you think that happens in books a lot?
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   The books become--
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   >> That does happen in books a lot.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   >> Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   >> That much?
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.200]   Give me some examples where it happens a lot.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   You said a lot to me maybe it happens a lot.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.040]   >> It's been a lot of time in fiction section of library, or not library.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.240]   >> Well, yeah, when Gil Emelio writes a book, it's Gil Emelio advert.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.440]   >> I mean, there's a lot.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   >> Gil Emelio, dog, on it, that's the name.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   >> Why were you trying to remember his name?
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.320]   >> We were-- I was sitting-- it's a long story, but there's a group of us talking and we
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.800]   couldn't remember his name and I thought I'd come up with it.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.320]   >> Well, that's a sad statement.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.960]   >> Who was that guy who ran Apple for a couple of years?
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.920]   >> No, it's because when I was talking to Al Alcorn, he was-- we were reminiscing about
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.160]   some weird scrap that happened at Apple.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.480]   And I got a lot of good stories, let me tell you.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.280]   >> Here's some interesting stuff.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   Do you tell me what this means?
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.840]   TechCrunch is saying that you cannot find iPhones.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.200]   Even the Apple store has stopped selling iPhones completely saying they're currently unavailable.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.520]   >> How are they coming?
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.880]   >> Yeah, usually that means when that happens--
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.400]   >> -- means they-- at some point in there, they may have screwed up.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.600]   At some point, they decided not to make anymore because a new one was coming.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.400]   They usually try to time it that they run out right before the announcement.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.520]   I would guess the announcement won't be until June.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.640]   >> All the guesses for the announcement are there's going to be a WWDC, right, to go with
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.800]   the newer software and stuff.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.720]   So it sounds like they may be-- you know, if it's true, I haven't tried it for myself,
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.680]   I might go into time tomorrow to actually pick one.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.520]   >> I'll try it online right now.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.240]   >> But it can be that, you know, they just messed it up because you'd expect them to not,
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.640]   you know, make it for a week or so before.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.360]   >> Yeah, tricky thing to do, though, get that supply changes right.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.560]   And I guess they-- yeah, currently unavailable.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.040]   You can't buy it.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.640]   >> One site, go to--
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.960]   >> Store.apple.com.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.440]   Click the iPhone, currently unavailable.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.760]   Both 12 to 8 gig and the 16 gig.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.000]   >> It's available on AT&T.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.760]   Somebody better tell AT&T.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   >> Whoops.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.600]   >> AT&T is fine.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.600]   >> Well, it was a good-- one of the websites, I think it was like Boy Genius Report posted
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:48.880]   that AT&T employees got a memo saying they're not allowed to take any holiday the week of
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   WWDC.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.080]   And the last time they-- because of the large sales event that's expected.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   The last major event that they weren't allowed to take holiday off for was the iPhone launch.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.640]   >> Yeah, no, it's-- I mean, Apple said that the iPhone Store and the new iPhone 2.0 launches
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.200]   in June, WWDC is in June.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.760]   I mean, it's pretty obvious that's when it's going to be.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.800]   So it sounds like they screwed up the supply channel, but that's not till June 9th.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.720]   So they've got another month of no iPhone sales.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Whoops.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.760]   >> Yeah, I don't know if I buy that because with Apple, I mean, they just keep-- it doesn't
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   make sense.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.480]   They keep booking the sales and they give you whatever the updated model is.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.480]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.760]   >> That's what they do with-- you know, that-- I just don't think it makes sense.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.760]   >> That's interesting.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.960]   So you say they should just take your money.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   >> They should be running the-- yeah.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.640]   I mean, running the supply out as much as possible before--
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.640]   >> That makes sense.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.120]   >> Auto release makes sense.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.240]   But I think Apple would still keep-- unless the Apple doesn't sell that many iPhones to
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.600]   their website, I think they just keep taking orders and then ship the new phones when
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   they arrive.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.000]   >> That's a good point.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.280]   >> It seems to screw up at some point.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.040]   >> It sounds something's fishy.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   >> Google's going to--
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   >> I guess the plus side that you can't cheese off customers that buy the phone like the
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.760]   week before the new one comes out if you can't sell them the phone.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   >> Maybe that's it.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.680]   Maybe they're so gun shy after this $100 price cut and all that.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.960]   >> You can still buy the phones on AT&T, you know what I mean?
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.880]   I don't think somebody's going to be any less pissed.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   >> Or order off.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.160]   >> Maybe you can't-- maybe you think you can and you just try to order it.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.760]   Go ahead and order it and buy one and see what happens.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.000]   >> Oh, I hit a quarter-five.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.040]   >> It let me hit the order button and put me into a final purchase.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.760]   >> Oh, all right.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.160]   Maybe they do have them.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.040]   I'll run down to my AT&T store after the show.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   >> Excellent.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.360]   >> Because you know what I buy it, that's the minute they'll announce the new one.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.960]   >> I love that thought.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.760]   >> Does anybody know anything about Friend Connect?
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.040]   Google's going to announce this Monday.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.380]   It's a quote according to TechCrunch, a new set of APIs for open social participants
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.940]   to pull profile information from social networks into third-party websites.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:03.720]   In other words, scrape your data out of Facebook and put it on all your other social networks,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.040]   which is a great idea, frankly.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.740]   Of course, people would have to cooperate.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.320]   Facebook would have to let you do that and I don't think it's in Facebook's interest,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   is it?
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.920]   Actually, TechCrunch, Mike makes an interesting point.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.140]   He says, "In truth, you want to be the guy where this stuff is stored because you're
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.100]   going to get the most eyeball, so it's in your interest to allow people to scrape it.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.340]   You want to be the home for this data, though."
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.260]   >> Yeah, it's almost like a password manager for your social networking day.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.860]   >> Anybody like me who's a joiner, and that's what John--
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.860]   >> Yeah, no kidding.
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.260]   >> This is what John calls me.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.420]   "No, is it every time I join one of these things, I got to go through the increasingly
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.460]   laborious process of adding all my links and sites and stuff.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.080]   I joined Friend Feed and it takes you an hour to put everything in there."
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:58.200]   >> Now Google is now competing with Facebook, who is now competing with MySpace over you
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.320]   basically different user data-porting specs.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.480]   There's only three different specs.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   >> Only.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.720]   >> Don't count the Yahoo Open strategy, which is the MySpace version.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.400]   >> That was the Google Open strategy.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.800]   >> No, no, no.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.440]   Basically, Facebook, there's Facebook Connect, and then there's DataVib, but it's not a
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:24.020]   MySpace calls it Data Availability, which is working with Yahoo and eBay in Photo Bucket,
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:29.460]   Yahoo calls it the Open Strategy, and then Google's supposed to launch on Monday with
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.460]   Friend Connect.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.060]   Basically, there's like three major competing strategies.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.020]   >> Seems like Facebook would own this one, just because they've got 70 million people
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.780]   in there.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.780]   Maybe MySpace would be--
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.020]   >> I don't know, MySpace plus Yahoo is a lot of eyeballs.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.900]   >> What is the Yahoo social site, though?
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   Is there--
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.580]   >> If Yahoo is partnered with MySpace using the same strategy for data sharing, it doesn't
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.580]   matter.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.580]   >> But you know, very few people are on both MySpace and Facebook, right?
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.140]   It's kind of-- there's a cultural divide.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.140]   You're either on what might like that.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.580]   >> Well, let's stop for a second.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.780]   Leo, are you on both MySpace and Facebook?
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.180]   >> I was, but not anymore.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.260]   I'm only on Facebook.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:14.060]   But my son, my 13-year-olds on MySpace, as are most of his friends, my 16-year-old
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.860]   daughters on Facebook is most of her friends.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.020]   And I think there is a divide.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.740]   There's a place where you switch.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.260]   I don't know if Facebook's younger.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:29.100]   I've seen studies that say Facebook is more-- it's the Hillary Clinton crowd.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.940]   >> Facebook, as far as I can tell, is like just everybody over the age of 20, like anybody
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.340]   that has a social network, is Facebook.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.380]   Because it's so like it's just become like a workplace thing.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.380]   It's the thing everybody--
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.020]   >> I think your move completely out of touch.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.020]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.020]   What's the new thing, or could--?
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.740]   >> No, I don't know if any of them are the new thing.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.740]   I just think there's still a bazillion people on MySpace.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.180]   There's a lot of older people on MySpace.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.380]   >> Well, there are far more people on MySpace than they're on Facebook.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.380]   You're absolutely right.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.380]   But I wonder how many of them are active.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.180]   >> I don't know.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.300]   How many people are really active on Facebook?
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.220]   What consists of active, you know?
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.220]   >> I go in there--
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.620]   >> I ended it just three years ago.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.940]   >> Oh, you're the antithesis of me, though.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.780]   You start-- although I say-- I do see you're finally posting on Twitter.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.660]   But in general, you start a blog and you never post again.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.660]   >> Absolutely.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.420]   I've posted one blog.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   I've posted one.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.900]   So I got you and Kevin off my back for about eight months.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.660]   >> He's the public.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.580]   He hates the public.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.580]   >> What is it?
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.580]   He's the public.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.580]   >> He's very private.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.580]   >> No, it's not even that.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.060]   It's just more of like, you know, what am I going to do in my downtime?
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.340]   Work on the, you know, two shows a week I have to do.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.780]   Apparently Twitter now is becoming a big part of it.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.780]   >> You do the babe.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   >> You do two shows a week?
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.020]   >> Yeah, we do system in TEXILLA.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.420]   >> Oh, but how many episodes of each do you do?
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.060]   >> One, that's more than enough.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.060]   Thank you.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.060]   >> Two shows a week.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.900]   How many shows a week do I do, Dane?
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.900]   >> 10.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.900]   >> 10.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.900]   Hey, you know what?
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.140]   Why don't I get eight people and we'll sit around and record a conversation for them?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.140]   >> That's true.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.140]   I don't do the hard stuff.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.140]   You guys all do the lifting.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.140]   >> Don't get me wrong.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.620]   I'm not taking-- what you do is amazing.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.420]   I don't know how you do the volume of content you do in a weekly day, but like--
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.140]   >> Because of you guys, that's it.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.420]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   I just sit here.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.620]   >> You know, and it's a brilliant strategy.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.620]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.820]   I'm just saying it doesn't really work for what we're doing right now.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   >> I guess not.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:29.180]   Although I am going to be doing 25 hours of video a week, so not all of it will be consumed
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.180]   by podcasts.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.980]   >> So what are you doing?
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   25 hours of video of what?
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.980]   >> There's--
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   >> No, no, no.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.540]   I'm like, that's a lot of video.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.380]   Leo, what have you signed yourself up for?
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.960]   11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   Five days a week.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.620]   >> Okay, so you're going to be doing the crisp, perrillo thing.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.620]   >> Yeah, but I'm not going--
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   >> What are you up for?
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.620]   >> Yeah, kind of.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.620]   >> Before you drop trial, I'm so excited.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.620]   Who wants to start the pool?
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.620]   >> I'm not going to drop trial.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.860]   >> I'm not going to drop trial.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.860]   >> I'm not going to drop trial.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.180]   I think that I can create enough content to fill that time.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.180]   I really do.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.180]   >> That's awesome.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.740]   But I mean, aren't you going to be burnt out for the radio show on the weekends?
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   >> I don't know.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.740]   You might be right.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.740]   >> Yeah, so I'm just like--
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.740]   >> Yes.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.900]   >> All I need is a shirt with really big pockets and I'm set.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.980]   >> The pockets are great.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.500]   >> I can't wait.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.540]   That's my new look on the show is going to be Mr. Big Pockets.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.540]   >> Open the pocket TV.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.900]   We're going to spend four hours a day waiting to find out what's inside Leo, LaPort's pocket.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.680]   It's the latest in an online 2.0 web social interactive and we use the Google Open Front
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.180]   Exchange strategy.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.180]   >> It's a kind of crazy notion.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.460]   I mean, I've got the switcher.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.460]   I've got the cameras.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.940]   I've got the lights.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   What more do I need?
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:47.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:48.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:02.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.

[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:22.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:28.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.940]   >> I'm not going to do that.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.940]   >> I bet it was.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940]   >> I don't know.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   We're ignorant.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.940]   >> Please dinky little screens in these megaplexes.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.940]   You don't get that.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.940]   >> I mean, I'm actually using it for special effects.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.940]   >> Well, my megaplex has DLP projection.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.940]   Now digital projection looks fantastic.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.940]   >> Right.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.940]   >> Looks great.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   Anyway, this is really more for this week in media.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   I think we're not experts in this, but we'll get -- they will talk about this in
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   greater detail.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   >> Cool.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.940]   >> It cares.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.940]   >> Comcast says they're going to go maybe.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.940]   >> Maybe.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.940]   This is granted DSL reports.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   250 gigs.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.940]   They're probably floating this to see what people say.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.500]   You'd get one free slip up in a 12 month period after which you pay an extra 15 bucks for
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.940]   each 10 gigs over the cap.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.940]   Initial testing will begin in a month or two.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.940]   >> Now this is what speed?
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.940]   >> And all of them.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:30.940]   >> Basically Comcast has an unofficial or basically a 200 gigabyte cap.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.540]   >> Yeah, they have an unstated cap of around 200 gigabytes.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.420]   >> This is about making it explicit.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.940]   >> Which I think is a good thing.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.940]   >> This coming week I'm supposed to get upgraded to 16 megabits down and --
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.940]   >> The burst.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.940]   >> megabits up.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.940]   >> I got the burst right now.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.940]   >> It's not as impressive as it should be.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.460]   >> No, it's not actually.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.020]   Maybe it's my neighborhood out here, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 10 bucks a
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.020]   month.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.020]   >> We got it.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.220]   >> I'm getting it cheaper than what I'm paying now.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.220]   >> Really?
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   Did you say you were going to cancel?
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.260]   >> No, I bitched and moaned.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.220]   In fact, what I did with Twitter, this is interesting for anybody.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.220]   I hate to say this because I'm poor guy is going to get swamped.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.420]   But I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:17.620]   I was moaning about it on Twitter and people should follow me on the real Dvorak.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.220]   And mainly because anyway, I was --
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.460]   >> And some people just go to Comcast.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.220]   >> Even he can't plug himself anymore.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.220]   He's like, "I just swear."
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.220]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.220]   Comcast cares.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   >> You can follow Comcast cares?
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.540]   >> Comcast cares is Frank.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.140]   And Frank set me up with this guy who's doing these deals.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.180]   And what can I say?
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.220]   >> If I Twitter Frank and say, "Kill G4 and bring back tech TV, Comcast will care."
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.580]   >> I don't think they care that much.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.340]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.580]   >> Everybody should Twitter Comcast cares.
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:36:01.340]   Because over here, to have an ISP with a five or ten gig limit is really normal.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.380]   Almost every package that you'll -- if you're an average student, you'll go to the high
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.380]   street and you just sign up for broadband.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.380]   It'll be like ten gig.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.380]   >> Yeah, but you guys, please.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.420]   >> And if you want unlimited downloads, you've got to pay double the cost usually.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.060]   But that doesn't really solve the problem because the problem is not really so much like --
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.140]   if the problem is clogging up the tubes, it's not so much like the fact the tubes are
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   turned on for a long time.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.260]   It's the fact that the tubes aren't wide enough.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.260]   You need more.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.260]   >> It's the peak.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.260]   It's the peak usage.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.260]   >> Well, thank you, Frank.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.580]   >> So I don't see how stopping people from downloading loads is going to solve the problem
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.380]   of peak time users.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:42.380]   >> Well, it's partially about hammering the most expensive customers out of the system,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:49.420]   which is essentially making additional money off of the customers that use the service.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.660]   >> And you know, that doesn't seem unreasonable.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.100]   >> Basically, they're going after it.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.860]   >> They're trying to protect their network, though.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.620]   I mean, I don't like the idea of going after BitTorrent necessarily.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:05.420]   But if somebody is really a hog, if you're using more than eight gigabytes a day, shouldn't
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.820]   you -- I mean, aren't you eating all of that bandwidth at the expense of everybody else
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820]   on the network?
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.100]   >> Well, they've spent lots and lots of money for lots and lots of servers that do nothing
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.740]   but allocate and control bandwidth.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.740]   >> I know.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.740]   Those are stand fine.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:24.700]   So really, there's a really funny hack out there that people, there's one particular
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.820]   guy's like, you got to show people how to hack their cable model because it basically
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.460]   takes the cap off of your connection.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.860]   The problem is that it's almost instantly detectable by servers.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:40.420]   And then the first thing they do is they basically ban you forever from using Comcast
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.540]   services.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.580]   >> You will get disconnected after four letters for, you know.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:52.260]   >> Whatever happened to Internet 2 was not supposed to save us.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.500]   >> That's only for educational systems, and it is running.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.060]   >> Yeah, it's saving at universities, so they don't have to soil themselves with our
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.060]   bits.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.780]   >> Well, it's -- yeah, I mean, the problem, Will, is that basically you have a huge amount
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.620]   of invest in infrastructure.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:13.340]   And companies like AT&T who have a lot of money, basically, it's more profitable for
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.220]   them to not upgrade their system and to not deliver the bandwidth that customers think
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.220]   they're getting.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:24.100]   The funniest conversation you can get into is with an AT&T rep at the corporate level,
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.820]   you know, when they're like, well, nobody anticipated anybody would be using X megabits
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.620]   per second continuously.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:35.460]   It's like, okay, so nobody -- the next thing AT&T is talking about how basically if you
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:41.420]   want to actually use your bandwidth for more than, say, a 15K page at a pop, you know,
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.860]   they cannot afford the infrastructure.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.460]   >> You'll have to go to a professional account.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.700]   >> I'll tell you why I care about this.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.700]   If you watch my five hours of day of video streaming, it's a couple of gigabytes.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.060]   So those of us who create content that eats up bandwidth --
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.940]   >> How about this for an idea?
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.980]   Substitute quality content for just a picture of you sitting there watching the television
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.980]   set.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.300]   >> I plan to.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.420]   You are the one who said I'm going to do the parallel thing.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.420]   I am not going to sit there.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   I am going to put out quality content.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:17.780]   25 hours a week of quality content.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.780]   That's 12 and a half gigabytes a week.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.420]   >> What are you going to do?
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.420]   Tell us.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.420]   >> You'll see.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.420]   Just watch.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.420]   >> Are you going to --
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   >> Are you going to --
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   >> Stop.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.420]   Are you going to be naked?
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   >> No, I'm not going to be --
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.820]   >> I already started the pants off pool.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.780]   >> I am not doing that.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.780]   >> If we pay you?
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   >> No.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.780]   >> No.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.780]   >> No, I'm not parillo.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.700]   You're confusing me with someone else shorter and curlier.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.700]   >> I am going to have --
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.420]   >> We'll have lots of different things going on.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:52.580]   I'm hoping that I can entice some of you guys up once a month.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.220]   But I have a lot of friends.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.140]   Steve Gibson comes up once a month.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   Alex Lindsey comes up once a month.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.940]   I think we can fill up some content here.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.540]   I plan to do how to's answer questions.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.540]   >> I'm going to be socializing happy at night.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.540]   >> It is.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   That's all Twitter's ever been.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.540]   It's my party.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.940]   >> Hey, I have an idea.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.940]   >> I'm not going to say --
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.940]   >> What?
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.940]   >> Martin Sargent will come up too.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   We can have a little mud wrestling.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.940]   I'm not going to say with the name of the company.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:23.780]   I've been talking to a number of different streaming providers.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.740]   One of them told me that the biggest -- in fact, wait a minute.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.060]   Didn't the installer, the T1 installer also tell us this?
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.780]   The biggest market for this is porn.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.940]   That a lot of the streaming -- the stuff that we're doing here without porn, a lot of the
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:44.180]   streaming -- this T1 guy said, oh, yeah, we're installing a lot of these for porno.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.180]   Live porno.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.180]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.620]   >> But what you're doing, Leo, is you're taking emails and questions from readers that
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.820]   want you to talk about or do particular things.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.700]   You're doing it live on camera.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   >> Yes.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   >> Instantaneously.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.700]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.700]   Wait a minute.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.700]   Hold on.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   It's tech porn.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.700]   That's what you're saying.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.700]   >> Porn.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.700]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700]   We're going to show products.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   I'm going to demonstrate product.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.300]   I'm going to do the same stuff I've always done with call for help in the screen savers.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.180]   I'm going to show people how to use stuff, but instead of it being packaged an hour,
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.220]   a week, or whatever, it's going to be continuous.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.140]   That's all I ever did anyway.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.220]   We did two hours a day on tech TV.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.980]   This is just doubling it.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.980]   >> Oh, boy.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.620]   What have I done?
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.620]   >> So, yes.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.420]   Say, how about all those devices?
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.420]   >> Yeah, like 12 producers between the two shows.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.500]   >> Yeah, but they didn't do anything.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.500]   We just took calls.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.340]   We just took calls.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.260]   Don't you know that was really ultimately all that filled the show was being put in
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.900]   people taking calls and then they'd have a few segments.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.300]   So, anyway, you owe ye of little faith.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   We'll see.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.780]   I may have a fire sale on LED lights any in a couple of months.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.380]   Just get some cameras cheap, a tricaster cheap.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:57.060]   >> It's an awesome experiment, but it's just a lot of airtime to film, man.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.060]   >> It is for you because you do two hours a week.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.260]   I do six hours on the radio alone.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.180]   >> I'm not arguing, man.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.420]   I'm not arguing.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:11.060]   I'm not a jam a lot of nothing into a sack.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.060]   I am the king.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.540]   >> I'm not saying you can't do it.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.060]   I'm just saying like, wow, man, that's huge.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.060]   >> I'm saying why?
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.500]   >> Well, how many people do you have to have watching?
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.500]   >> It makes no money.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.100]   It makes no money.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.660]   There's 2,000 people watching now.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.420]   That's right now we jam the servers.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.060]   We're going to get a dedicated server cluster this week.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.940]   So I'm hoping that that will increase the...
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.540]   >> I just think it's an epic experiment.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   I just can't admit.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.340]   Like, don't get me wrong, dude.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.020]   You can talk all day.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.620]   I mean, give you a cup of coffee in a few hours and you'll fill it, but it's just like,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.620]   oh my God.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.620]   Now it's like filling all day with a dead one.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.620]   >> Yeah, you're doing...
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.980]   Actually, being able to do it is one thing, but why?
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.860]   >> I've been asking myself that late at night.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.660]   I wake up at four in the morning.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.500]   I go, why?
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   Why?
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.660]   >> Because you know what?
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.420]   People need high quality tech content from people that they love.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.700]   >> That's what you're saying and you're right on, man.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.380]   >> At the end of the day, that is why we are here.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.380]   >> That's right.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.380]   >> We like talking about this stuff.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.980]   >> That is why I was watching "Taxzilla" while I asked my dinner this evening.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.980]   >> Thank you.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.780]   >> There's a big market for this stuff, I think.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:17.940]   >> So let's do it.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.420]   Get you back on "Crankey Geeks."
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.220]   >> No, no, I'm too busy.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.060]   >> Do you have it?
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.020]   >> Hey, I watched it.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.620]   You know, Rob Enerly was very impressive.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.620]   I thought I did a very good job.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.620]   >> On what?
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.620]   >> On "Crankey Geeks."
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.620]   >> On "Crankey Geeks."
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.780]   >> Oh, the one, the show that I had in my last...
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.260]   That was the last of my long hair.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.100]   >> Yes, the last long hair show, you had "Rina Slutsky."
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.140]   She just pronounces her name that way so you don't pronounce it the way you think it's pronounced.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.140]   >> Slutsky?
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.140]   >> Slutsky, right?
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.180]   >> Yeah, I know most people really think it's pronounced "Slutsky."
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.180]   >> Slutskya.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.580]   >> So, "Hina Slutskya," Rob Enerly, Sebastian and you, and that was a good show.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   I enjoyed it.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.780]   "Crankey Geeks."TV, right?
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.620]   >> Yeah, "Crankey Geeks."com, actually.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.900]   >> The comm, sorry.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.100]   >> So, let me get back to Comcast.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.220]   The other thing they did, which I think is really interesting, is a core...
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.220]   Again, this is a source.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.300]   This is a DSL report.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.220]   This is not official.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.100]   But they are going to start paying attention to these DMCA letters.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:25.420]   Up to now, the record industry sends these letters saying, you know, they contact your
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   ISP.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.940]   They say, "This guy's downloading all this stuff."
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.220]   And the ISP sends you a letter.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.420]   Up to now, apparently, I didn't know this.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.300]   Comcast hasn't been tracking the DMCA letters.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.700]   They just forwarded along and they don't even pay attention.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.140]   So now, after four letters, you're going to lose your account.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.580]   If four letters in a month, you lose your...
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.380]   In a year, I'm sorry, you lose your account.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.380]   So that's...
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.940]   I didn't realize this, but according to this guy, they haven't been enforcing these.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.940]   They've just been passing them from...
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.220]   >> That's an idea then.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.940]   How about let's just take a group of us and spread us around and then send in these
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.580]   complaint letters to people we don't like, whether they're doing any violations at all
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.020]   or not and get them the four letters and they get cut off and then we do the same thing
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.340]   with AT&T and then it would take the person completely off the net.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.660]   >> How long do you think before somebody does that to me?
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.620]   >> Well, now that I mention it...
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.260]   >> Thanks, John.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.020]   So I got the burst, by the way, the Comcast Burst.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.940]   I have a business class account.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:27.340]   It's when I go to speedtest.net, 22 megabits down, 3 megabits up, but it's burst, remember.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.860]   So it slows down on the downstream after a while.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.540]   You don't get continuous 22 megs.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.940]   But it's still pretty fast.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.860]   I've been able to download...
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.020]   Well, the Godfather, that's a good example.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.580]   All three movies in...
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.540]   Oh, wait a minute, did I say that?
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.780]   In just a matter of hours.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.180]   >> That are number one.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.140]   >> No, I'm not using it to download movies.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.780]   I'm using it to stream and all that stuff.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.980]   But it's a business account, so they can't give me a hard time on that because we have
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.260]   five people using it.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.940]   >> So you have a business account?
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.260]   What does that cost a month?
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.260]   >> 160 a month.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.260]   Yeah, you pay more.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.260]   160 a month.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.260]   >> Kind of high.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.020]   >> That's actually pretty cheap for a business account.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.540]   >> For 22 megabits down, 3 megabits up, it's great.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.540]   I'm happy.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.540]   >> No, I mean, compared to like what AT&T would do.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.540]   >> Yeah, and it includes TV.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.540]   I get CNN too.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.900]   >> Oh, well.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.460]   >> Yeah, okay.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.980]   >> So the Comcast Cares guy now has...
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.940]   Before this podcast goes out, has 906 followers.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.980]   Let's see how long that account stays open.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.580]   >> He'll keep it open.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.580]   The guys are...
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.580]   He's one of those guys.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.780]   I don't think he's going to answer anything in real time because I think he was one of
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.140]   those guys, because I get all the...
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:36.300]   My correspondence with him on over Twitter was all after midnight.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.660]   He's like one of those, you know.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.900]   >> Is Frank Elyason from Comcast customer outreach fake name?
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   You think that's his real name?
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:42.900]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.900]   Well, Frank, I think is.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.900]   >> That's pretty cool.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:45.900]   >> It's very cool.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.660]   >> I think more companies should do that.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.660]   That's a great idea.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.380]   >> No, and in fact, there may be companies on Twitter that do it.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.380]   I'm not sure.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.220]   Somebody just mentioned it to me and said, "Go to, you know, send the complaint."
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.100]   Instead of complaining to us, your followers complained to this guy, you know, kind of
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.100]   like a little bit of a joke.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.380]   >> Oh, Steve Gilmore says he's listening and he cares too.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.380]   >> Just so you know.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.380]   He cares.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.940]   >> He cares about what?
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.940]   >> I don't know.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.460]   If Comcast cares, so can Steve.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.420]   >> So I was reading a post on them.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:22.140]   I think it was on TechCrunch about how PR is going like microPR and how things like...
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.580]   Everyone gets journalists and things get so fed up and press releases these days and massive
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:30.060]   blasts that it's all about like now, like what they call microPR, like little networks
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.100]   and little Twitterings and stuff like that and how it's much more efficient.
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.100]   >> Scoville has been complaining.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.460]   Scoville's been complaining because he's just getting all of this kind of constant chatter
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.460]   from PR.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.460]   >> Yeah, it's like...
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.580]   >> If your job is to be a journalist, then press releases just come with the territory.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.460]   That's like part of the thing that you do.
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.580]   That's like complaining, you know, that you're a shire.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.580]   >> You want to hear the irony?
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.580]   >> Suddenly, everyone wants you to make food, you know?
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.380]   >> There's an irony to this.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.020]   >> Well, basically, yeah, I'm with you on the irony.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.020]   >> What's the irony?
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.820]   >> The irony is the real journalists aren't getting bothered at all, they're not getting
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.740]   any press releases.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.740]   It's unbelievable.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.140]   My press release count is falling almost off the mat.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.140]   I don't get anything.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.500]   >> They're going to bloggers instead because bloggers are more effective.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.140]   >> No, because bloggers will do what they say.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.140]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.140]   >> They're less selective.
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:20.060]   >> Yeah, no, boy, like, somebody's giving me some attention.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   I'm a blogger.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   >> Right.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.060]   It's not even that they're less selective.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.060]   It's a lot of cases.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.060]   And there's actually...
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.060]   >> They're lonely.
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.980]   >> Well, it means first of all, highly critical bloggers that do some pretty...
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980]   >> That would be good investigation.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.620]   But there's a lot of blogs that basically just repost press releases.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.620]   >> Right.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.620]   >> You know, and that's...
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.220]   >> I think that's actually an effective strategy.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.620]   I'm sure that's, you know, from an evolutionary point of view, that's why it's happening because
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.620]   it works.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.620]   >> Well...
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.220]   >> But the thing is, it's not, you know what I mean?
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:50.180]   It's not evolutionary and it's not new and it's not a new complaint.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.980]   I mean, you know, having effective...
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:56.180]   Basically, the whole point of hiring a good PR company is knowing that they will have excellent
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.660]   relationships with people who are in your targeted demographic, people you're looking
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.660]   for.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.660]   >> The last PR person I spy...
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.580]   I don't talk to PR at all.
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.140]   The last PR person I talk to is Amy Crichit.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.260]   Remember her from Tech TV?
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.500]   She was our web woman.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.260]   She's now doing PR for Louis Roseto, the guy who started Wired Magazine.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.500]   You know what Louis' new venture is?
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.500]   >> Chocolate.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.500]   >> Yes!
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   And it's really good chocolate.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.060]   >> Yeah, that's what he says.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.060]   >> I get...
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.060]   He's shit that well...
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:30.500]   >> No, he says they're just remelters.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.260]   They just remelt.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.260]   He sent me some.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.260]   Did you not get any?
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.260]   >> No, I didn't get any.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.260]   He's not going to send me anything.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.260]   >> I'm a blogger.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.260]   >> So John...
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.500]   >> Amy sent me some in a cold pack.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.260]   It is the best...
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.300]   Bear with me.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.300]   Dane, am I right?
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.300]   The best chocolate.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   It was incredible.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   >> I doubt it.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.740]   >> No, it was really good.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.260]   Anyway, that's the kind of PR I respond to.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.260]   Send me chocolate.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.900]   >> So I was talking to a PR person the other day about this trend in this phenomenon.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.460]   And I mentioned you.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.860]   And she said to me, "Well, I guess Leo must get swamped with stuff."
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:07.860]   I said, "Leo doesn't get any."
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   >> I don't get anything.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   And I don't want anything.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.900]   >> Well, I know you don't want anything, but you don't get anything.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.500]   And there's not a lot of direction.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   And she was shocked.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.660]   And I think you've actually been overlooked.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.340]   You're in some sort of limbo...
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.060]   >> Shh, you're bigger than you should be and I don't know.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.060]   >> I'm bigger than I should be.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.060]   They don't know.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.580]   >> I wouldn't say you got 25 hours to...
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.700]   A lot of some box openings, they go big on engaging in Gizmodo.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.700]   >> No, see, because I don't accept stuff.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   So that's part one.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.780]   I don't talk to vendors because I don't want to do that.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:44.100]   I did have dinner with an advertiser on Thursday, full disclosure with a radio show advertiser.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.300]   But you kind of have to do that, right?
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.700]   I mean, that's kind of part of the deal.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.380]   But there's only five of them.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.980]   >> So they're paying you for the advertising opportunity.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.180]   I don't think having dinner with is going to be...
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.740]   >> Actually, he was the CEO of ESET, NOD32.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.100]   He's a theoretical physicist.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.460]   He's from Slovakia.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:10.060]   His expertise is in superconducting, right?
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.060]   He's doing work on a paper on a unified...
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.060]   I can't talk.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.620]   I'll let chocolate get me a little stone.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:21.260]   On a unified theory of superconducting.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.340]   And he's got an interesting business plan.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.740]   Get this.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.740]   He believes...
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.860]   There's no proof of this yet, but his models lead him to believe that it's possible to
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.140]   do superconducting at...
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.020]   Right now, it's at very, very, very low temperatures.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   But if you could do it at normal temperatures, of course, huge breakthroughs technologically
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.580]   in all sorts of things.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:47.300]   He believes it's possible, but the question is you've got to find the material.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.860]   And it's almost like a SETI at home thing.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.220]   I mean, there's just a lot of analysis.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.980]   You have to go through a lot of materials, look at their structure to see which will work.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:52:00.140]   But he's basically forming a company to do this to try to find this material.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.140]   And it's kind of one of...
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.300]   It's like a lottery.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.700]   If they find it, huge.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.020]   But there's no proof it exists.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.140]   He believes it exists.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.300]   Kind of interesting.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   >> Cool.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   >> This is a guy...
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.300]   So that was a good...
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.660]   See, I didn't mind that dinner.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.740]   He also explained to me why elephants have big ears and I thought that was fascinating.
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.220]   >> You don't get out enough.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.220]   >> I don't.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.220]   I don't do...
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.460]   You know, I don't like those dinners.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.460]   I don't like to do that.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.460]   I'm very shy.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.260]   >> You're actually, you know, even though you're outgoing and you're affable, I think you're
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.260]   a hermit.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.260]   >> I am.
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.260]   That's why I built this studio.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.900]   I never need leave here again.
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.980]   I want people to come to me.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:38.980]   But no PR no vendors.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.660]   So don't call me.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.220]   But you know, there is...
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.260]   It's interesting because there is some power in all this.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.260]   And I don't think...
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.780]   I think it's so non-traditional that you're right.
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.780]   I think PR companies don't even get it.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:53.780]   >> Oh, no.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.780]   Companies get it.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.780]   A lot of...
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:56.780]   >> They don't get it.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.780]   I agree with you, Leo.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.220]   >> Well, if they got it, I would think they'd be all over me.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.220]   But I don't...
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.220]   I'm not...
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.220]   >> That's true.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.260]   >> I'm hesitant to say this, except that they don't listen to Twit either.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.860]   >> They don't listen to Twit.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:06.860]   They don't have a clue.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.620]   >> Thank goodness.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.540]   >> So has anybody got Patrick for Tekzilla?
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.660]   Did you get the size star yet?
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.660]   The Mac clone?
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.820]   Are you going to get one of those?
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.820]   >> No.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:20.300]   I'm not really going to bother because I don't expect them to be available for very long.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.660]   The Apple hasn't crushed them.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.660]   And it's also...
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.340]   I mean, basically, they're taking a white box.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:33.140]   They are taking an openly available free hack to the EF-5...
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.140]   >> The Hackintosh.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.500]   >> Yeah, we're going to build one on the show.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.500]   >> Which is freely available.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.660]   >> The guy that wrote the hack is pissed off because it's not supposed to commercially
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.460]   redistribute it, which the size star is doing.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.460]   So that's...
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.460]   Apple will sue him.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:49.940]   The guy to him, the hack, could sue him, but he's not going to because God knows what
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.540]   would happen then.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:57.780]   And three, you cannot reinstall the operating system.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.940]   They basically pre-install OS10 on it.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:05.260]   According to the unboxings I've read, like, and gadget had somebody doing one and linked
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.500]   to somebody doing one.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.820]   You can't reinstall the operating system yet because they haven't figured out how to do
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.300]   an end user friendly reinstallation.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.180]   So if anything happens to the OS, you need to reinstall, apparently you're going to have
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.500]   to do something special.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.340]   They have a workaround, but they don't ship anything in the box that will allow you to
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.340]   reinstall the operating system.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:25.620]   >> Plus you have to be very careful about system updates.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.540]   You can't just willy-nilly install those.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:33.340]   >> It just seems like a great way to save a couple hundred bucks on a Mac instead of just...
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:34.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.340]   It's like...
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.340]   >> Buy a Mac.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:38.340]   >> But it's like you lose the whole thing.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   >> Or get the downloads for free.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.340]   >> The fantastic thing, you know, it's like buying...
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:45.740]   >> I'm trying to get a struggle to think of a really good analogy, but it seems like
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.660]   for the sake of saving a couple hundred bucks on a basic basis, you lose the entire point
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.660]   of the Macintosh platform, which is like...
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.660]   >> Right.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.660]   >> ...look good.
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   >> Right.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.660]   >> No, I don't...
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.660]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.540]   I think it's like buying a sports car and taking me engine out and putting it in like a beaten
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.540]   up old pickup or something.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.540]   >> There you go.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.540]   That's a very...
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.540]   I think that's the analogy.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.540]   That's it right there.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.540]   >> You saved a couple hundred bucks.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:09.540]   >> It's...
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.700]   >> Somebody in our Twitch forums has one and he's talking about...
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:16.060]   We have a forums for people who donate to Twitch.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.780]   Even if you donate a buck, you can get in.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:22.220]   Twitch.tv/forms and there's a guy in there and he's talking about it.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   You know, he has a Mac.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.540]   He has a laptop.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.620]   It's not that he doesn't have a Mac.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.620]   It's just kind of an...
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.620]   It's interesting.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:30.420]   But boy, the limitations are very severe.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   Just somewhat...
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.380]   Like you can't reinstall, you can't download updates.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.260]   I mean, it just seems like an all-out great idea.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:36.260]   It's just amazing.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.580]   >> He does say it's faster.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.580]   It's noisier.
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.580]   He says it's faster.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.780]   >> Noisier is no good.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   >> Faster than his eye mask.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.820]   >> Well, the problem is the EFI firmware that Apple ships all over it.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.300]   >> They can't control the fans.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.100]   >> Well, it amazes me that...
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:56.700]   EFI has been touted by Intel as the next big system upgrade.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.700]   >> Right.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.100]   >> But it's like the last two years now.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.100]   >> But nobody's using it.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.100]   >> It's the BIOS, right?
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.820]   I mean, the boss is as old as...
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.740]   >> You can't get anybody to use it.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.740]   >> Well, 15, 20 years.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:07.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.700]   >> And EFI is long overdue to hit the mainstream.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:14.060]   And once EFI does hit the mainstream, then you'll be able to install Mac on it really
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:19.540]   simply because the problem that you get on the side-style box is the kind of EFI emulator
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:20.540]   you have to have.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:24.540]   >> But it's still amazing to me that EFI hasn't caught up.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:28.260]   >> I agree with you that EFI should have caught on faster, but it's like if it works, don't
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.260]   fix it.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:35.180]   Something that you'll be able to install Mac OS 10 on anything is once the EFI becomes
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:39.900]   more common, that I got to disagree with because they're just going to continue to put, you
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.380]   know, basically software switches inside the interface that will make it more difficult
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.260]   to run the operating system.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.780]   I mean, it's going to be...
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:54.740]   Apple, unless Apple does a serious about-face on running their software on non-Mac platforms,
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:59.140]   it's always going to be a wicked, rip-and-pain to run on anything else.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:06.460]   >> Hey, by the way, Marques Stewart has Twitter that Circuit City is also on Twitter.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.020]   >> Yeah, I got that from him too.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.020]   Circuit_City.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.780]   So you can watch as they kind of dwindle away to nothing.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.780]   >> There's a...
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:15.780]   >> Best buys?
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.580]   Who's it's trying to buy them?
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.220]   But that's a good business.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.220]   >> Lockbuster.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.220]   >> Lockbuster.
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.220]   >> A video bid.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:24.220]   >> A video.
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   Okay.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:31.220]   >> It's a business, selling brick-and-mortar electronics or selling running videos.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:36.340]   >> Oh, you know, the one thing of a push there.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.340]   These aren't...
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.260]   The guys who run Blockbuster aren't stupid, so I would assume that something good is going
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.460]   to come up with this deal.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.460]   >> Okay.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.660]   >> You guys care about the pro IP?
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.860]   >> Yeah, so we do care about that.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:50.860]   You want to talk about that?
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:56.140]   Actually, a couple of bills now being proposed that are relevant to geeks.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:57.620]   You're talking about the pro IP act?
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.140]   >> Yeah, one of the listeners is sending a note about this thing.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.380]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.620]   There's a couple of weird things floating around out there.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:09.540]   There's that and the thing about getting DNA from new babies.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:15.220]   >> The pro IP is HR 4279.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:16.980]   It was from the last...
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:17.980]   It's the...
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.340]   I love these acronyms.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:24.740]   >> It's a prioritizing resources and organization for intellectual property act of 2008.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:29.700]   And it's basically the record industry trying to kind of just screw you if you steal anything.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.900]   >> I think it's more the Hollywood.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.860]   >> Yeah, Hollywood is behind us, yeah.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.140]   >> Herman, the guy who's been getting quoted a lot on this is a congressional rep from...
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:41.060]   >> Well, that brings me to my column that will be in Monday's PCMag.
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.060]   >> Yes.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:47.060]   >> It's an entitled, at least until they change the title, if they do.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.900]   >> The redstone is wrong.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   >> You met this guy.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.060]   You said he's a nice guy.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.700]   And now you write a column.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.700]   You scurry home from Korea and write a column skewing him.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.700]   >> No, I'm not.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:58:59.700]   >> You're never going to get invited by that.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:00.700]   >> He's wrong.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:01.700]   I'm not skewing him.
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.180]   I'm just saying he's wrong.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.660]   >> What is he wrong about?
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.140]   >> He's wrong about the YouTube lawsuit.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.900]   I think he's barking up the wrong tree.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.620]   >> By a consuming YouTube for...
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.380]   >> I'm basically saying that, you know, he's trying to associate YouTube two minute video
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:18.020]   clips with people stealing entire movies.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.580]   And I don't see it as being the same at all.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.660]   I think one is fair use and one's not.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.580]   >> And that aside, isn't it valuable?
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.060]   Is it a valuable promotion?
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.900]   >> Yeah, that's beside the point.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.900]   I actually addressed that.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.900]   >> Did you ask him about that?
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:31.900]   What do you say?
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.420]   >> I take his side on that.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.700]   It goes like this.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:41.180]   Hey, you know, if somebody puts a clip of John Stewart on YouTube, that's like a promotion.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.340]   That's like a free promotion for the show.
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.500]   And people will now you'll get a bigger audience.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:50.300]   The counter argument he has is, hey, they're not the marketing department.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.300]   That's my property.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.660]   I'll do with it what I want.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.020]   I don't want to do this.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.020]   I mean, who went to there?
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.300]   Were they working for me?
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.180]   I mean, you know, it's like, no, you can't just be...
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.580]   You're not the guy that makes these decisions.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.580]   >> Good.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.380]   Yeah, he's going to run his business right into the ground because you're not the marketing
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.380]   department.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.980]   Let me do it.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:13.020]   So now that you guys have finished beating on your chest about how the most pop-up, like,
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.740]   basically that this is all file trading is essentially the non-
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.140]   >> No, we're not talking about firetreating.
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.100]   We're talking about two-minute clips on YouTube.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.100]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.100]   >> Right.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.100]   We're not talking about file trading at all.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.100]   >> That's a whole other...
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.740]   I mean, I'll make the same claim there, but...
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740]   >> Hey, Patrick, go ahead.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.740]   Give it to us.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   >> No, I'm just...
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.740]   >> I'm just...
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.300]   >> I'm just saying, I can see where people would be...
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.060]   I mean, it's an interesting thought.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:41.540]   Does it... does it absolutely... does YouTube posting promote activity back at the main
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.540]   site or...
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:47.180]   >> Well, there's no question that does, but all Redstone is saying, but even if it does,
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.540]   I get to do it, not you.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.540]   >> And he's...
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.540]   >> I know.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   >> I mean, he's legally right.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.820]   Of course he can say that, but is that a bone-headed thing or what?
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.820]   >> I don't know.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.820]   >> I think that's...
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.820]   >> I think it's a bone-headed.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.820]   >> I think it's bone-headed.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.900]   >> I mean, this is like those non-disclosures that all these people sign off on.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.380]   Sometimes I could look at what Microsoft or somebody's going to do.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.580]   I don't sign these things, by the way, but I could.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.300]   And I could look at this and say, "Well, you know, if I had written it up in my column
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.340]   a couple of days before you're supposed to roll out, I bet you would do you a world
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]   of good."
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.420]   You know, they may have some really elaborate marketing scheme that they want to...
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.740]   >> And we've seen there really elaborate.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.340]   Look, he should be down on his knees...
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.540]   He should be down on his knees thanking the people who made... you know... who made John
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.180]   Stewart a hit because they posted his clips on YouTube.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.420]   He should be grateful, not saying it was my job.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.940]   >> He was a hit before the people started posting.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.940]   >> All right.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.860]   Well, Saturday Night Live, which is not, I know, understand a Viacom production, but
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.620]   there... you could point to a lot of shows.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:42.660]   The office was a flop until people started pirating it and everybody saw it and said,
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.300]   "Oh, wow, this is a good show."
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.300]   Saturday Night Live.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:50.820]   >> Well, to bring it back to the pro-IP act, if you guys, I think the best part about not
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:55.140]   to take anything away from this discussion, but aren't you a little afraid that the idea
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.260]   of the White House intellectual property enforcement representative or White...
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.260]   >> That sounds good.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.940]   >> ...pointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.540]   >> I've been taking the acronym just a little too far here.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.500]   >> Well, it's just like... it's so funny.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.340]   This is going to be the... I like what... I think...
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.140]   >> Oh, my God.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.460]   >> Declan McCullough actually summarized it pretty well.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.180]   The whole idea... I mean, because one of the things they want to do is they want to increase
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:24.100]   the fines and copyright cases, increase the maximum penalties, or make them easier to
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.820]   get.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.940]   Any computers used to facilitate a copyright crime can be seized by the Justice Department
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.100]   and auctioned off, but it's like Wiper's head.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.980]   It was just such a sad... sad acronym.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   >> I like that.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.420]   >> Is "charged with being the president's principal advisor and spokesman for intellectual
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:46.700]   property matters, as well as identifying countries that don't adequately protect IP rights."
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:51.020]   It's to create its own official seal as well.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.940]   And will be paid as well as the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   >> Because what we need is more focus.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.740]   >> Oh, it's just great.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.900]   This is like... this is like... this is like... this is like... you know, creating... quote,
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.580]   "joint strategic plan, identifying individuals involved in the trafficking of pirated goods."
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.060]   Declan McCullough's articles are really good.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.060]   An annual report to Congress.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:17.260]   >> You think we don't have quite enough when our plates are ready?
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.500]   Well, I mean, I say "we" I mean "you" because nothing that crazy would ever come up
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.660]   over here.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.580]   But, you know, as someone who is...
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:30.100]   >> I think this... I think this effectively your poodle in the war on copyright, I feel
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.220]   slightly miffed about this.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.980]   >> I think this was proposed last year and didn't get anywhere.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.940]   And I don't think it's going to get anywhere this year.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.220]   >> I want to know... I want to see... I want to see somebody do a comparison between the
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:45.620]   amount of taxes paid by the top 10 Hollywood studios versus the cost of setting up the
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.460]   pro basically these people, the 10 intellectual property out of shades to go to embassies
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.460]   around.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:56.180]   >> The more about... The RIA finally is really realizing that the feds may not be the guys
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.180]   to go to.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:01.300]   They're actually going to the states now and they're trying to get the states, which is
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.580]   much easier to do, by the way.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:08.580]   The win over state legislature is pretty trivial as we've seen with Verizon stopping all of
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.420]   the Pacific Wi-Fi.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:16.180]   They want to have the states ban peer to peer basically and they're going state by state.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.980]   >> Ban peer to peer.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.980]   >> It seems absurd.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.980]   >> It's crazy.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.060]   >> It's crazy talk.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.820]   The Tennessee is doing something like this.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.700]   I think that's more concerned to me than the feds, frankly.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.700]   However...
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:38.700]   >> I think it will change as the political climate changes over the next six months.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.700]   Do you think it'll be...
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.140]   >> Well, that's why you go to the states because the states won't change very much.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.940]   >> Anything like that start to become like...
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:44.940]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.500]   >> Could it become mainstream issue?
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500]   >> Maybe.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.940]   >> As long as you're writing your member of Congress about H.R. 4279, the pro-IP Act,
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:05:01.820]   say no on that, also there is now a net neutrality act that I think is pretty good.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.740]   >> The pro-IP act is actually a bipartisan act.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.300]   It's not being...
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.220]   It's democratic and republican.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.820]   >> Well, the recording industry or in the movie industry can buy people from any side of
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820]   the aisle.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:21.900]   >> Yeah, but in terms of whether or not that's going to change, I think this is more legislatures
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:27.180]   will do a particularly good job of targeting representatives in their community and then
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.180]   just...
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.180]   >> Yeah, that's true.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.860]   >> Part is working their magic.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.460]   They don't care if you're a democratic or a republican.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.340]   They want you to enact legislature that makes them feel warmer and fuzzier.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.540]   >> So not to change the subject, but I have a product I want to plug.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   >> Okay.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.540]   >> It's a great version break.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.540]   >> Love it.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.540]   >> Oh, yes.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.540]   >> It doesn't work so well on the PC, but it is awesome.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.060]   >> You know, there are new Windows versions better.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.060]   >> It works great.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.540]   >> Their Windows version is better now.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:58.140]   They did an upgrade recently and it was very crashy before.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.140]   But yeah, I use it on that call.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.700]   >> They've done an upgrade in the last six weeks.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.260]   >> Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.260]   >> Oh, okay.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.260]   Off to version tracker I go.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.500]   >> I may be wrong, but I think they have.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.820]   >> It works fine.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.820]   I don't think it doesn't crash with me.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.780]   I did a whole bunch of things over.
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:16.260]   I wanted to watch on the laptop on the airplane when I was flying to Korea.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.260]   And so I moved all these things over the age 264 AAC.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:23.460]   >> You better be careful, John, doing all this international traveling with all this
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.420]   copyright infringement on your laptop.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.660]   >> These are all mostly two- >> It's a fight that will be out.
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.180]   >> Mostly turn your classic movie stuff.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.060]   >> No, actually will it's not.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.300]   It's actually pretty frightening.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:39.500]   There's been some great articles recently about basically how crossing the borders you
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.500]   have.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   You cannot protect your laptop.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.140]   You have to give up encryption passwords or forfeit the laptop.
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.140]   It's actually pretty funny.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:51.980]   >> You have to use double-staged encryption so you have two or three different layers
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.460]   of encryption that you give up one password.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.260]   It looks like you've given up something.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.500]   And then they beat you up and maybe do another password and then you give up.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.740]   You say, "Okay, here's the real stuff."
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.660]   And then you have some porn.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.820]   And then you, but nothing bad.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.140]   And then they think you're okay, we'll get out of here.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.460]   >> John drawing from his CIA days.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.060]   >> Steve Gilmore says you're right, John.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:19.540]   He stopped watching in Comedy Central because of the clips on YouTube.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.100]   So there.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:25.900]   >> I would stop watching it because it's getting depressing.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.780]   >> Where's the comedy?
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.020]   Give us some comedy here.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:35.100]   So, handbrake 9.2, I think Patrick on Windows is pretty good.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.340]   I mean, it's still better on Mac.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.380]   Hey, before we go on, I do want to mention audible.com.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:46.380]   Audible.com/twit is the place to go for your fantastic.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:08:00.140]   [
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:10.700]   >> Quick, we got to colorize it.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.620]   >> Twit is a great place to go to try your audible audio books.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.580]   If you haven't listened to audio book, it's a great way to read.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.580]   I say read.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   Some people say listen.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.820]   In any event, you'll certainly get a lot of reading done because wherever you are in
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.980]   the car, just as you're listening to podcasts, in the car at the gym, in the garden, you
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.420]   can listen and learn.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.220]   We actually had somebody plug.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.260]   Was it last week?
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.620]   Yeah, I think it was.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:44.180]   We had Andrew Horowitz, the discipline investor, who was talking about your book, John, the
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.540]   Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.260]   He said there's a sequel coming.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.620]   I didn't know.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.620]   I think they all John off.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.620]   I think they did.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.220]   I think he's gone.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.220]   >> What should we talk about?
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.220]   Warren Buffon speaks.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.220]   The Whitten Wisdom of the World's Greatest Investor?
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220]   >> Why not?
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.380]   >> Well, we should pick up, wasn't the discipline investor actually going to appear on Audible?
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.700]   >> Oh, let's see.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:09.700]   Is Horowitz on there?
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   >> I must say, yeah.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:15.700]   I can never work out how to spell disciplined.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:19.140]   If the nuns had disciplined you a little bettering high school, you maybe you would know how
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.140]   to spell that.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   Let's see here.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   I can't spell it either, apparently.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:30.580]   I like C, I, P, O, I'm like school.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.420]   Discipline decisions but not yet the discipline investor.
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   We're still looking.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.300]   We're still waiting for that.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.420]   There are so many good things on here.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.180]   You know, I'm just trying to find the John Adams biography.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.180]   I love that.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:46.460]   >> I just, nine pounds of which is sitting next to me on my coffee table.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.940]   >> See if you had it on your iPod or what do I answer?
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.060]   Did you watch the HBO special?
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.140]   >> I haven't seen that it comes on at night when the baby's sleeping.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.340]   So I haven't really experienced a lot of it.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.900]   >> Now you should sleep when the baby sleeps.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.700]   >> I have to watch it from the beginning.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.700]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.500]   >> No, no, I mean.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.180]   >> It's only seven episodes.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.540]   So just, you know, there'll be on DVD, I'm sure in a year.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.980]   >> There's not a lot of surprises, I mean.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.980]   >> No.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:13.980]   >> Well, there's a stunning.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.980]   >> It's beautiful.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.420]   Yeah, and I'm not really crazy.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   I'll be honest.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.460]   I'm a big fan of, what's his name?
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:24.020]   >> I don't think he's not great in this.
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.540]   >> Well, no, I don't know, because I was thinking about that because it was such a weird choice.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.540]   I mean, weird choice.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.540]   >> It is a weird choice.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.180]   >> But I think he's a pretty good actor.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:35.860]   I don't know if he's who I would have chosen, but he does a pretty good job.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.580]   >> I think he's a better comic actor.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.540]   But in any event, read the book.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.940]   >> Can you get more money?
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:47.140]   >> Well, you know, Adams was very prickly and not well liked.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.700]   He was the John C. Devorak of the Revolutionary War.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.700]   And so, no, that's not true.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.700]   John's beloved.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.420]   >> But it's despised on a lot of levels.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.420]   >> He was.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.060]   In fact, it's one of the reasons I think the book is so interesting is it really gives
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.420]   you a whole new look at the Founding Fathers.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.540]   I think a very fresh, contemporary feel.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:10.980]   I mean, you really get a sense of as if it's really happening, what it was like in 1776.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.980]   It's a great book.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:12.980]   I highly recommend it.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.940]   There is an unabridged version and an abridged version.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:23.180]   And of course, you're going to want to read the unabridged version if you can.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.180]   Just fantastic.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.180]   And it is long.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.180]   It's 30 hours.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.180]   Wow.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.180]   But you get your money's worth.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:36.180]   So if you want that for free, go to audible.com/twit or Warren Buffett or economic hitman or just
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.980]   a huge variety of stuff.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:44.460]   History, biography, business, fiction, of course, erotica.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.060]   It's all there.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.580]   You can listen to it all.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.580]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:53.260]   We do thank them there for their support of the Twitnetcast.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:12:01.140]   There's an interesting, I think, somebody said the point out, which is Carl Icahn interested
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.660]   in acquiring Circuit City.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:03.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.660]   Well, that's what's going on.
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.660]   Blockbuster.
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:06.660]   He doesn't.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.660]   He's not Blockbuster.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:11.820]   No, he's a, I think he is a shareholder in Blockbuster.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.580]   You think that's what, okay.
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:18.780]   So Circuit City's for sale and it's kind of between, what happened is Blockbuster, they've
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.860]   allowed Blockbuster to look at their financials.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.940]   And I think Icahn has been instrumental in that.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.940]   For all I know, he's a shareholder in both and just wants to make some money.
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.580]   Just ruin it for everyone.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.580]   But I'm still, I'm sorry.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.340]   I mean, okay, I'll take it, your word that the Blockbuster guys are smart.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:41.380]   They got to do something because I don't know how much more business there is in the video
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.420]   rental business.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:48.700]   How much life is left in that and, uh, what DVD rentals will be going on for a long time?
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.820]   Will they agree with past the guy on Netflix though, not via a store?
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.820]   Oh no.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:58.060]   No, if you want to, you get the house with family and all of a sudden it's a hair up
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.180]   their ass about wanting to watch a movie now.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180]   Where are you going to do?
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.820]   Wait for the Netflix thing to show up.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.700]   So you really think the video store, the model for DVD rental and video stores is going
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.700]   to be around a long time?
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.180]   Well, I don't know about long time, but I think it's viable.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.980]   People like you every time I go under one, they're crowded with people.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.660]   I think if you're not a hardcore movie buff then, then rental shops are still good because
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.020]   people like the idea of number one, they're like, they do have just going and browsing
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.420]   around and seeing what's on the shelves.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.940]   And number two, if you suddenly get to like, you know, a Saturday night and you're like,
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:27.940]   what am I going to do?
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.940]   Okay.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.940]   I'll go and watch a movie with the missus.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.780]   You go down and pick a movie.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:35.020]   You don't necessarily think like a week in advance.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.260]   I want this particular movie.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.260]   Let's get it to me.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.940]   I want to do it because I'm a bit of a movie geek and I'll just like, you know, watch
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.420]   three or four films every weekend.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:49.740]   But for most people, I think, you know, going to the store and renting stuff is still a
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.140]   really big thing.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.140]   Absolutely.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.820]   I mean, it's a very nerdly behavior to kind of be happy with like, you know, the movie
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.420]   surprise show up in your, in your, you know, your mailbox.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:05.460]   It's what, and don't get me wrong, if anybody wants to experience it, you'd be Netflix.com/techzilla.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.460]   That's okay.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.260]   So the, for free, they can have a trial on that.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.260]   Sorry.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.260]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.260]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.460]   Show it double dipping.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.820]   That's double dipping.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.980]   You can't do ads for techzilla in this show.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   I'm having fun.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.980]   Edit it out.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.980]   I'm teasing because it's really fun.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.060]   I'll give you the plug.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.740]   And if you're going to, by the way, if you're going to register a domain, why don't you
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:33.260]   go to Cali Lewis's site and go to go daddy and I don't even remember what her code is.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:37.220]   Go to Cali Lewis's site anyway.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220]   You knew it.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.220]   It is.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.220]   Actually, that's our good ad.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.220]   How it is?
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.940]   Hey, hey, back to the topic.
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:47.340]   To get back to the topic because I'm having fun with my deforax.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.180]   Gb3, by the way.
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.180]   Gb3.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.180]   Okay.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.180]   No, but I mean, it's really interesting when you look, because I know a ton of people with
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:59.700]   Netflix accounts, but the vast majority of people I know still, it's very like it's Friday
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.700]   they want a movie.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.700]   They go there.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:02.700]   Okay.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.180]   It's not going away anytime soon.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.500]   I stand corrected.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.100]   Seems to me it's more abundant.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.780]   It seems to me that Circuit City is even more more abundant.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:15.580]   Yeah, but I mean, you're, you're an early adopter on a stick, Leo.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.940]   I mean, think about it.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.100]   Actually, I'm on a, on a ball.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.100]   Oh, you got one of the little round exercises.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.100]   That was the ball.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   Good for the.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.100]   It's like a stick.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.100]   All right.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.100]   All right.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.100]   All right.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.060]   I could see I've been wrong all along on this entire show.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.660]   And I stand corrected, but I just have to say one thing.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:43.980]   I want to thank Jeff Smith at the Jeff Smith.com G E O F F Smith.com because he did a little
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:44.980]   song for us.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.220]   He actually did a video too.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.300]   And you're in it and you and you and you and you.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.860]   It is a you want to hear it?
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.860]   It's kind of cute.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.860]   Go for it.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.860]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.860]   Very cool.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.860]   Have you heard it?
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.860]   I'm really it's called I am a twit.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:06.860]   I'm a little bit of it.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:14.020]   He's so talented.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.220]   Going down another rat hole.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.780]   Didn't mean to.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:22.740]   So that we lost control, but that's the way it goes.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.260]   It's clearly a listener.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:31.260]   I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:39.260]   of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:46.260]   bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:53.260]   bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:17:00.260]   bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
