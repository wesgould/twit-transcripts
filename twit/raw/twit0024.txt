[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 24 for Sunday, September 25, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Alright, good ones again.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   This week in Tech, I, from Mince Barnard Grill in beautiful downtown, Larksbury Landing, California, and a big cast of Twits today.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And our once again live broadcast.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Shall I introduce you? Somebody sent me an email, said, "For some reason, my MP3 player dies after the first half hour.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   So could you do all the good stuff in the first half hour and introduce people at the end of the show?"
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And I thought, "No, I can't." Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I love you sitting there. You know, sitting to his right, John C. Devorak.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Hello. Did you get a nice fan? Although, apparently that's not true.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   No, actually, well, somebody sent me some of the mail, but I do have some news later.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Alright, we'll talk about that.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Robert Herron from PC Magazine.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   [Applause]
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Roger Chang from Gamespot.com.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   [Applause]
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   David Prager is here. He's from Rev3.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   [Applause]
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And of course, last but not least, Kevin Rose.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   [Applause]
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And also, we're going to talk a little bit later on to Amber McArthur is here from Command N Television and Call for Help.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And from OpenAlpha.tv, we've got Jen Cutter. So we've got more people.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   [Applause]
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And by popular demand, we finally got some women on this show.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You know, after we had Jessica Corbin on, I've been asking her back again and again, and she just won't come anywhere near us.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Her email address is about where she's decided to even change the box.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Maybe if she's not getting the emails with the request.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So because, John, you're so famous before I get no spam, we got some hats.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   This is a, I get no spam hat for John C. Devorek. Look at that. Isn't that great?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   This is what I need.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I didn't order that. I want to thank Chris Haines from Corporate Casuals who made those stuff.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   We get a lot of good stuff. There's a Twit Hat.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yeah, I need a couple of of those.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   If you guys like these, we can hand these around.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   If you guys like these, we can make, would you buy Twit Hats if they were available?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's going to end up being like one of those, we don't have enough to give them to everybody.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Yeah, we don't do any advertising. We just, we just, we just sell clothes.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Well, that's what's going to be like one of those concerts for somebody who hasn't had a hit in 30 years, but they're selling the stuff in the back.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And then, who, what, from Australia, you came all the way from Australia?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Step up to the red mic there. I want to, this is going to be the first Twit where we actually spend the first 20 minutes talking nonsense.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Where are you from?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   From Sydney, Australia.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   That's great. Welcome.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And you brought us something to eat.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Can you say something about shrimp on the Barbie?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Shrimp on the Barbie.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   When you get back there, you say hi to my friend Canadian Paul, who's in Sydney right now?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I'm sure he's right after this.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah, I bought you some kangaroo jerky.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's good.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It says no.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They're enjoying it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   What Australians would need that, you know.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   They don't drink fosters either.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   No, that's true. We don't drink fosters. We wouldn't touch fosters.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   They need a stick.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I'm doing that.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's for Americans.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   By the way, the flavor enhancer is 621.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's in this?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   That's my own sodium glutamate.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Oh.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Hey, that would figure it out.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It says not to be sold in the United States.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I made that up.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I made that up.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I did declare it coming in.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Did you?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And they thanked me.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   The customs guy said thanks for bringing us jerky.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   They said thanks for actually admitting it.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And he let you in.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And he let me in.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's sanitary jerky.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's sanitary.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It's very nice of you.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We really appreciate it actually.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It is good.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And we're giving it to everybody.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   He's our longest guest ever.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's really the longest traveling audience.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   The farthest audience member?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah, people come from all over.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm a contest.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   To see us tonight.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Let's give him a can of spam.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You know what's...
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Culture.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Cultural exchange.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's what that is.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So we apologize.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You're welcome.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's a cultural exchange.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Are we going to start the most important story of the week?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   What is the most important story of the week by far?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The most important story of the week is...
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The MS-Riorg or...
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   The official announcement of the break-up of Microsoft.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Oh, you have to ask it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But Microsoft didn't...
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   We're going to try to like we're eating.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Hang your word jerky.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   No, no, no.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Let's pause the tape for a moment while we all finish.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   There's no tape.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   There's no tape.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So Microsoft did a re-work.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   First, what's the story there?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   What did they do?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Well, it looks to me as though they're in a panic mode.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Here's a company, by the way, that is basically the stock's flat
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   lined over the last few years.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Historically, Microsoft's always said,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   "Oh, I'm sorry."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Historically, Microsoft's always attracted a lot of really good people
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   by promising them a lot of stock options and then letting the stock go flying high.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And then they'd make all the money on the stock and they wouldn't have to pay them a lot.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Right.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   But they didn't have to pay them a lot.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now they've got to actually pay them real money and people aren't interested.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They'd rather be millionaires than high salaries.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   This accounts for the brain drain to Google.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And many a brain drain.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I mean, there's a lot of guys I've run into over the last couple of years that used to work for Microsoft.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And there are all these go-getters and they're much happier working in a little startup
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   where they can get some, maybe make a few million dollars on a stock deal.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So by re-orging it, and it looks like if you look at the reorg, it's almost like if you just theoretically
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   divided the company up into three companies that could stand alone, that's what they're doing.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And it seems to me that you're either going to punch out a couple of one or more of these companies.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So what are the three divisions?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You got Xbox and all that stuff.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   The consumer.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Yeah, and it's got the keyboards and all the other things.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And then you have the operating system Tools Guys, and then you have the Office software stuff.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That does sound like three.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And three fairly good companies.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah, and the Office Guys, you know, they can do the SAP kind of products and they do the enterprise stuff.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And then the original Microsoft, I think, would be, I think that if they were going to retain a name,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   they'd retain it for the OS part of the business.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Oh, so they'd have to rename these other...
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah, I think they'd be another public companies that could have their separate stocks,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   or they could even take the Xbox one, it seems to me, and roll it out as an IPO.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And because they're going to need a lot of cash to compete in that business.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Roll it out as an IPO and then become just a gaming company.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But John, if you were going to do a reorg, you would reorg along business lines anyway.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I mean, it doesn't mean that they're about...
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   They'd reorg five or six times and they've never reorged this nicely.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I mean, you know, there's all kinds of ways of reorging.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Or they're finally trying to get back to the original flat management structure that kind of carried them
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   during the first couple of times.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Well, you know, it seems to me that what I argue is that if you take a look at the Microsoft cash cows
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and their core competencies, each one of these separate entities has one of them, not two of them in it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Which means that they could sustain.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Right.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I think it's a bust up.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So when is it going to happen?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It would take probably a year and a half to two years.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And where does Bill go?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I think Bill would go with the OS company.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's what it is.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But he'd get a lot of stock with the other companies.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's sort of the board of all the companies.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Where does Balmer go?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Well, you know, Jeff Rakes is who gets Balmer.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I think Balmer is going to retire.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I think Jeff Rakes, by the way, had to give him something eventually.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   He's the guy that they gave the office division to.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Rakes is the guy they've been grooming since day one to be the CEO.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Right.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And he can't just be sitting around forever waiting for Balmer to, you know, retire.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, Jay's center fit in and all of that.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Would that go for the entertainment?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   That would go for the Xbox.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   That would go for the Xbox.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Interesting.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Not OS.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   That would make it pretty powerful.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   No, I don't think it would go in the OS.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Pretty powerful group.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Jim Altshine is going to leave next year.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   He's going to go on the OS health problems.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That explains that.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Interesting.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I think that's a good theory.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Yeah, that's as good as any.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It makes the stock more attractive as a speculation.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Well, there's precedent for this.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Other companies have done this.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   AT&T's done it very successfully.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   HP's done it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   HP did it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's successfully in the short term, I think.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   You're actually right.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I shouldn't say AT&T's was very successful.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Now, to roll this free scale successful, there's plenty of examples.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The HP stuff where they spun off the--
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Right.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   There's a button.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Well, HP spun off all the--
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Instruments.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Right, the instrument.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So it's not an unusual thing to do.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   It makes sense, especially when a company gets unwieldy, which Microsoft clearly is unwieldy.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's too big.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   So what was the other big story that you had, Patrick, that you wanted to--
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I wanted to--
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Is Tivo--
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   The Tivo shot itself on the foot.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   We did that last week.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Oh, the subscription stuff?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The red flag?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   What's the subscription stuff?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   This is stuff they actually knew.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I think Tivo was trying to drive itself out of his business as quickly as possible.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I got a nasty letter from somebody at Tivo who said, "How about you?"
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It seems that way.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.720]   From somebody at Tivo who said, "How could you say that?
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   It's a great company."
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   It may be a great company and it may be a great product, but with like-- I mean, you look
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.680]   at MIF TV, there's all the different media boxes that are coming out there.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.760]   Any new Tivo service subscription activated on or after September 6, 2005, you agreed
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.400]   to subscribe to the Tivo service for no less than 12 months.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.480]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.720]   And if you cut out, they charge you a $150 on the termination fee.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   Whoa.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.440]   And you agreed to pay such an early-- any such early termination fee.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440]   That's like a cell phone company.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.240]   It's very much like a cell phone company.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   Is it?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.560]   Well, then they can give you the hardware cheap or free, right?
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   Well, they're all--
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   Is that the plan?
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   Maybe they're already giving you the hardware cheaper for--
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   It's 50 bucks after rebate.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   I mean, that's pretty--
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.560]   It doesn't get a lot cheaper than that.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.000]   What percentage of providers don't have their own system that they want to keep out?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Everybody does.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I just got the Comcast cable box.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.920]   So, I'm moving customers now for Tivo's new customers then.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.640]   I don't know because it's a pain in the butt because you have to get the cable to work
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.400]   or the infrared blaster or the thickness.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   See, that's like the nikoness, though.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.880]   Partner with the cable card individuals, the company--
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   That makes more sense.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880]   Right.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   They're front-end.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.880]   They don't want to do that, though.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   I mean, people are like in Comcast.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880]   It's a combat information.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.640]   Is there anybody that would buy Tivo?
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   As a company, maybe?
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   I would buy a dual tune.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   No, no, no, it means it's a company.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   No, no, it means it's a company.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   It'll buy the company out.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   You know, Apple was rumored for a while, but that doesn't really get a sense to me.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.480]   I mean, someone like Comcast, I mean, they're DVR socks, if you look at how it says it's
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   worse.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   Well, it's not bad, then it's gotten better.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.560]   I mean, but it doesn't have the recommendations and things like that.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   Do you use the recommendations?
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   I have people who do.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   I have people who do.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.960]   The only thing that's missing is the wish list where you can enter in, you know, I want
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   to see everything.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   It's a season pass.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   It has a season pass.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   Oh, it does.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   Okay, I haven't put it back.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.360]   It's not intuitive to get to it.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.440]   You have to press where you record a show, every episode of a show.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   Everybody does that.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.640]   Yeah, but do all TVRs at this point match Tivo's functionality in terms of if your show changes
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.040]   times or channels?
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   I don't know.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.480]   I think so because shows are identified as, you know, by a number, a unique number, and
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.360]   all it's doing is looking for that number.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.640]   I don't think it cares what the program guide looks like.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.560]   That's a VCR you're talking.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.960]   Tivo's recording by number.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   I don't think that's worse.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.160]   Yeah, one seems to work on time constraints.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.600]   Like you're recording a time not a show.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   Yeah, I mean, it says show and you click on it and it spins it up, but if the show doesn't
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.200]   show up or it gets moved, it doesn't record it.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.080]   I'll tell you why the podcast is because you can look ahead to when the next recordings
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.200]   will be and it will be in a variety of different times.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.600]   Can you look ahead a year?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   No, you can.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.800]   That's because of the Tribune listings.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   It's using the Tribune listings.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.000]   You can only look at far ahead as the listings go.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   A couple of weeks.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.920]   But that means that the machine is smart enough to say I'm recording the show, not this time
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   slot because that's what I'm saying.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.920]   But Tivo isn't that smart though because you can still set the little buffers like five
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.040]   minutes before, start the recording five minutes before the show or five minutes after because
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.320]   it can't tie into that program guide information like a Comcast box could.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   Right.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   Right.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   No, people are all that.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.760]   Yeah, but what if it changes on the back end?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   Like what if Comcast flips the time on Tivo?
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.640]   That's up to the program originally or either the station broadcasting it or the owner itself.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.400]   You can't tell Tivo to record a sporting event.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   Right.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   You're not going to get it.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   It doesn't know.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.480]   And already you have the providers tweaking start times and stop times of programs by
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680]   a minute or so just screw up the Tivo people.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.520]   What I'm saying is if you have a Comcast box, if you think about what would you want to
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.760]   screw up somebody that wants to watch your show that it really it really boggles because
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   you want them to watch the app.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.120]   If you have a sporting event and there's like a Comcast box running and it runs a half
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.720]   hour late or you know extra innings or whatever, will the Comcast box continue to record all
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   the way through the end of the game?
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.200]   None of them will currently because it doesn't know unless you tell it otherwise.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   You don't know.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.400]   There might be a plug in for myth that does something like that.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.440]   How many people offer dual tuners?
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.680]   I mean of all the Comcast box has dual tuners.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.680]   I just got my new box has HDMI out now.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   Yep.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   Does yours have a TV?
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   No, I have DVI out.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   I would like HDMI out.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   Although DVI is the same.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.320]   Do those boxes let you actually pull the content straight off course?
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   No, of course not.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.120]   It's so funny because they have like they have a couple of fire wire ports and a couple
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   USB ports.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.320]   They have like ethernet but you can't do anything with this port.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.640]   I tried the fire wire port.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   I thought oh cool.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   My TV has a fire wire port.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   Nothing else.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   It's a connector.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   It's a connector.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   It's actually no wiring on the inside.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.320]   I sat down with Tivo to go service this weekend and actually tried to move content from my
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.240]   Tivo to my PC and then burn that to a DVD.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   I could play on a set up player.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   How about work?
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   It sucks.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   It sucks so bad.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   It wasn't again.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.560]   Number one they've clearly made a deal and part of this is the macro vision that has
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   been there for a long time but the new features that allow a content broadcasters to then flag
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.240]   willy-nilly however they want, whether or not you can keep it.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.760]   But the other deal is with Sonic Solutions and their DVD burning software.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.320]   The only way to burn from a Tivo box series to a DVD that you can play in your set up
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.080]   box is using Sonic Solutions software which costs you 50 bucks.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.120]   So they must have made a deal with them at some point to say look.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.040]   Well it seems like they're desperate for revenue streams anywhere.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   That's been there for a long time.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.760]   Then I tried it and I'll tell you the transcoding.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.200]   It's encrypted on your Tivo or whatever but the time it takes you not only to move it
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:24.600]   over however fast your network is but then to simply decode all that video I had two
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   hours of content.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.560]   It probably took me close to two hours to get that on to a DVD and that's just.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.440]   Most people you've got to buy your set top burner.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.240]   The myth TV takes care of all these problems.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.840]   You turned him on to myth TV Kevin and now he's like this big myth TV supporter.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   Actually it was Milo.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.840]   Oh Milo Madin?
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.520]   Yeah it turned me on to myth TV.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.480]   You did watch the system episode though right?
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.160]   Yeah but actually I saw his thing afterwards and it was a rich kind of like.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.520]   Somebody would just pick a chair and set top box though that you could do that with without
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   having to.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   They kind of went through really cool.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.720]   The myth TV was going to have a reference platform.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   Have you been following that?
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   A hard work.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   Hard work.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   No I haven't seen like this.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   They're going to say this is the specs that you should go to the box.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   Yeah they should go to the guys who invented myth TV.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   That's a good idea.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.600]   Combine with some other hardware guys who are going to come out with a reference platform
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   so you could have a nopics like disc that was myth nopics.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.600]   Well there is.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   There is.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   Yeah that's what they have.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   That's what you used isn't it?
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.160]   They have all the specs for it.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   You know exactly what you can put the fuck to the camera.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   Yeah yeah that would be nice.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.480]   That would be nice yeah.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.840]   And then just build a disc and yeah.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.880]   You know you take the instructions, throw those things together, throw the disc in your
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   - It's a great idea.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.880]   The key thing.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.000]   It has been sitting on the same hardware designs for way too long.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.840]   I mean why are there no analog dual tuner boxes yet?
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   I mean sure you can get it for direct TV but that's it.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.200]   I think that's one of the most important.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.080]   Once you start using a system like Tivo it's having that dual tuner ability.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.400]   The ability to watch anything you want and to record anything you want simultaneously.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.680]   Item three Steve Jobs says the record companies are greedy.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   Wow.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   Wow.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   No more than.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   I do.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.560]   This is news from like two or three years ago.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.560]   Two or three years ago.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.640]   Well you know that in January the - no because here's a story.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.040]   It is old news in the sense that in January and we've known this for a while the record
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.800]   companies get to renegotiate with Apple and they're pushing Apple to raise - to have two
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   tier.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   We talked about it that time.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   You like those margins Apple?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   Like the Apple Store.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   We talked about it.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.840]   Well Jobs has stepped forward and said if the record companies do that they will be encouraging
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.640]   piracy and they're greedy and he's actually taken a pretty firm stand that he will not
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.120]   establish two tier pricing.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.600]   Well the other thing is the record companies are already hitting back and saying well yeah
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.840]   we're not getting a split of the iPod sales so cough up or you'll find another source
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   for your music.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.840]   Yeah well I mean both of them.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.200]   Yeah but why should they get a cut of the iPod's?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.160]   They don't want - what Steve is saying is there's no room to make more money here.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.720]   It's got to be 99 cents.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.120]   Terribly sorry you negotiated the deal and the record companies are like hey we don't have
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.200]   this fabulous hardware model we're making money off of.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.960]   You're making a lot of money off the axis we've given you to our catalogs.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   Do you want to continue to have access to the catalogs?
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   You want to continue.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   You get 70 cents on every one of those sales.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   What are they bitching about?
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   They're doing okay.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   That's not what I've heard.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.880]   Yeah 70 cents is with the number of the media.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   70-30 yeah.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   Really?
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:11.000]   Yeah Edgar Bronfman, former Seagrams Air now owns Warner Music Group said iTunes needs
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.400]   us as much as we need iTunes.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.840]   So I mean there is a battle there.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.840]   It's true.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.840]   Who is more powerful?
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.080]   There's a tradition with the record industry that used to happen with the retailers Tower
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.240]   Records is a classic example.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.320]   One day some years ago they said we're not paying ya.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.000]   And they put the screws to say we'll pay you know we're putting on net 90.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.880]   You're not getting paid for a while and the record companies - what are they going to
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   do?
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   What are they going to do?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.720]   Of course Tower is still around.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   They're still doing it.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   Kind of.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.080]   But you've got to think that Apple in the long run the iTunes music store is pretty important
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   to the record companies.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.640]   So would you still buy if they bumped the prices up to buck 50?
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.200]   Well what they're talking about which is fine with me is charge a buck 50 for the new stuff
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.440]   and then charge less for the old stuff which I think is fine.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.600]   This is what Bronfman's he says.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.200]   He says there's no content in the world that doesn't have some price flexibility.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.240]   Not all songs are created equal.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.880]   So some songs are worth more.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   We want to charge more.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   Some songs are worth less.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   We'll charge less.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.960]   What's the evidence of this in the history of the record industry?
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.360]   Well the single is always sold for one fixed price.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   No you go to the store and there's a sale.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   They close out.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.440]   Now some junk they're trying to move in this store.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.600]   Now you have online retailers with flexible price.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.360]   Well that's the thing you said.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.800]   Because they could change the price all the time.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.000]   There's nothing physical that they have to get rid of.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.640]   It's just a fire on a disc.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   It's nonsense.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.520]   But I mean from their point of view look we're in this great ultimate flexible world.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.560]   It's like airlines seats.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.160]   We could charge, look at the airline seats.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.260]   You could charge whatever the market will bear and you could change it minute by minute
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.260]   using computers.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.040]   I'm sure they'd love to do that right.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.640]   Screw the customer as much as possible.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   Sales go up.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   Price goes up.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.280]   And it's a perfect situation.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.560]   You can monitor it and change it as ad hoc.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   You don't think so.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.560]   That'll happen.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   Who knows.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.760]   I just think it's ridiculous that these guys don't have their act together.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.080]   Well I think Steve's right that if consumers get P.O. they'll just go back to Kazan.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   Well I agree.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.600]   I mean right now I'm half.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.400]   I'm okay with spending nine cents a song.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   There was a dollar fifty.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   I'm going to go to a Russian site and go crazy.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   You know I'm talking about it.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   I know what it's all about.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   Russian sites.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   I don't know what you mean.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   How did they get away with that?
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   I guess there's no copyright law in Russia.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   Would you like some more kangaroo?
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   There's no consporters.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.540]   Well they've actually had people go after them.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.640]   But they've they've it's Russia.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   What are you going to do?
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.240]   You think about Germany is a lot of the sites there.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   Bulgaria.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.280]   You must drive the record companies crazy.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.440]   I think because I've talked to end users saying I'm paying.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.720]   I get from all them P3s and I pay them ten bucks a month.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   Technically they are paying.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   They are paying someone who can do that.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.000]   They think it looks they think it's legal.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.760]   It's been recorded to the guys at all of them.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.760]   It is.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   It is.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   It's not.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   But it is legal.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   I mean except for the latest tracks that come out music is really a commodity at this point.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.760]   It is.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   Damn it.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.920]   And they will have it on pretty soon.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.880]   Every hard drive you're going to buy is going to come preload.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.560]   It should be fifty cents a cut.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   It's max.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   It's library type material.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   What about the Yahoo model?
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.480]   Five bucks a month unlimited.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Is that a good model?
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480]   The subscription.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.880]   You get the program called move audio.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.520]   And you can go look at it.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   And you strip out the.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   No it does.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.080]   It's like an intermediate thing when you play the song it takes the data stream and kind
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.440]   of slips in between like a plug in and says let me just move the file over to this.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440]   Over to here.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   I'll take that.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   And then so is it playing it.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   Saving it.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.600]   But you think about Apple's model for a dollar a song that that is no bargain.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.160]   That is as expensive as a CD going to me driving to the store buying it.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.640]   And quality is worse.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   Right.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   Right.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   You don't have the nice little package in the line.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   It's all that stuff.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   There's room for innovation.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.600]   Item four name that worm.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.200]   There is the common malware enumeration initiative.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.960]   I can see you're all very excited about this.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   I think you're all very excited about this.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.880]   Well this was like the phone that's phone mergers you had up.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.080]   All of us are like hmm tell us more Mr. Revers.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.800]   Well I think this is a good name.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.880]   Good idea because right now if you get a virus PC Silling calls it one thing.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.000]   Symantec calls it another thing because first you don't know what your virus is and go
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.600]   do a search you can't figure it out.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.080]   So they're finally saying look we have to come up with a common naming scheme.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.400]   It's actually cert the computer emergency readiness team that's promoting this so that
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.880]   there's one name for each virus.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.680]   You know one girlfriend named in each virus name and just leave it at that.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   You know.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   It's a great idea.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   That's all in favor.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   Yeah we're done.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   Next item.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.360]   Certified nomenclature.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.640]   So it shall be done.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.920]   Make a note of that will you David?
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   Of course.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.880]   Firefox is it safer than Internet Explorer?
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.600]   It is if you patched a 1.07.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.960]   Not if you don't patch though.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.440]   Yeah big flaw and now there's a very explicit online a very explicit description of how to
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.080]   take advantage of this flaw and you can just take over somebody's computer.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.640]   You should put this on devorect.org/blog.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.640]   They will.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.280]   They're there and you could like own their computer.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   Make them come back again and again.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   There's plenty of things that you can do.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   I can rack up my numbers and show it to some you know.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   Advertise it.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   Make some money on that.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.760]   Get some security.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.920]   I get this a lot and I'm actually curious what you guys think.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.960]   Some security experts say oh no look at Internet Explorer.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.280]   There are fewer flaws this year than there were in Firefox.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.000]   Firefox is holy.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.600]   And then others and I include myself and they say you know but the problem is that Internet
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.320]   Explorer is an invitation to spyware.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.840]   Firefox is not.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   And it's open source.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.480]   We know about the bugs right.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.960]   I wouldn't use any of the other people here use Internet Explorer currently.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   How many in the audience?
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   How many in the audience?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   Internet Explorer users.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   That one guy.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   Step forward.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   Okay we got one.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   How many people are using Firefox, Mozilla, anybody?
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   Almost everybody else.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   So obviously we've conned y'all into it.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   It's our fault.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   It's our fault.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   It's our fault.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   It's because we make millions.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.040]   You know you find that the smart money I've noticed this on my blog because I track all
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.360]   the users and when you can tell when somebody links from like a kind of a dumb site and then
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.640]   somebody links from a smart site you can do it by dumb I mean users that aren't really
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   sophisticated.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   They come from MSN.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.280]   You can see the browser stats just changed drastically.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   Absolutely.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.120]   You know the Firefox people or smart users all use Firefox.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.040]   It's like Google.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.920]   Anybody intelligent, well this was a few years ago.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.320]   But how this is how you could test if somebody used to do that?
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.480]   I used to do it all the time on Big Thinkers.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.800]   I'd ask you know whoever it was.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.160]   In fact I got into Gingrich.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.800]   I said what do you use for a search engine?
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.880]   You know he should be using Google.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   He says Yahoo.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   There you go.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.760]   Does anyone use Opera?
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.760]   Opera's free now.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.760]   I know but does anyone use it?
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   I know.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.520]   Why do they use it over way back?
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.520]   Ted uses Opera.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   I like Opera.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.440]   Opera is a great product.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   I think Opera's.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.960]   Birthday the first introduced tab browsing.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   Yep.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.960]   In a popular browser.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   Yep.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   And that's right.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960]   What's their plan?
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   How are they going to survive?
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   It took the ads out.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.560]   It took the ads out money.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.360]   You know what they've done some innovative stuff.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   That's how they make money.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   They make money from.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.360]   Oh is that how they make money?
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.360]   They make money from what?
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.560]   I mean the Mozilla the off of Firefox they make like 12 million a year.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   From their front page?
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   From the Google searches.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   Well they.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.800]   Oh you mean Google gives them a kickback when you use that little Google thing.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   Right exactly.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   In the address bar.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   They get a kickback.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.160]   We got right a browser.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   12 million a year.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   You didn't read that?
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   They're making it.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.760]   They're creating a for profit you know section of Mozilla and this is like.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.920]   This is operas built in search box is currently powered by Google and opera gets a cut anytime
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.760]   a user happens to find their way to a Google ad via that search box.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.320]   Don't we all use that search box in the browser right I mean you don't go to Google.com anymore.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   You use a search box in the browser.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.640]   Yeah I can.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.640]   I miss out on all the Google doodles now.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   It's stinks.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   Yeah you're right you don't see the the.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   On the front page.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   It gets you.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.640]   It's Google start page.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.640]   They also have a good browser.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.640]   I like that.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   They're very scalable so they licensed a lot of.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.440]   That's where they really make money when we had Yawn Vontesner on that's what he was talking
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   about.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   The portable market right there.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   Yeah yeah yeah.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.360]   Speaking of which there's a the first portable phone that makes an attempt to jump to your
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.760]   PC a virus.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.720]   It's a Symbian virus I don't they're all Symbian for some reason and when you when
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.880]   you sync up to your PC it jumps off your phone onto your PC to infect your PC fortunately
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   it's hard to get on the phone.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.480]   It's probably harder to get on somebody's phone than it is to get on their PC.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.000]   How many people are making that kind of like an explosion stunt.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.480]   They're a blue teeth linker.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:33.240]   I think all viruses are publicity studs ultimately for the virus author don't you.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.080]   Do you see this Google's offering free Wi-Fi now in San Francisco.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   No one knows what you're able to find.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.720]   It's not cracked exactly.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.640]   It uses PPTP which is a if you use a bad password is easily crackable but I know it's
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   secure.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   Here's the deal.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   It's secure.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   They're doing it.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.480]   I think there's a couple of access points in San Francisco so nobody here's tried it.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   I haven't found it.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.880]   The idea is people are saying this is the next thing for Google.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.440]   They're going to do free Wi-Fi.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   I don't know.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.480]   It must be one of them things where you get revenue somehow just by people magically
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.680]   using your system but you probably have a splash screen to find something.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.520]   And then so they'll do put this every you know we'll be sitting here we'll be using Google
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.760]   Wi-Fi but right now you go on on a Windows machine you have to download a little app.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.880]   And what the little app does is it handshakes.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.520]   Well somebody's figured out that it's just PPTP and in fact there's an Apple script that
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   makes it work on OS X for free so as soon as if Google does do this unless they turn
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.000]   this off you'll be able to use Google VPN.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.600]   Oh actually you can do it now you can use Google VPN on any wireless.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.120]   So I could use it right now what you'll do is you'll log into Google servers VPN servers
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.720]   and you're securing securely surfing on any access that goes into their Google server.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   VPN.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   Which isn't that actually from some of the hardware that works.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.960]   I was just flying around with this week.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Isn't that cool?
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   This is going to make Google a ton of money.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   A ton of money.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   How are their Wi-Fi?
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   Targeted ads or what?
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.800]   Targeted and we'll be sitting here right now.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   Have your little side.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   It'll know where we're at.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.680]   And say hey, Noonan's has a special on beer between the Google blog.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.600]   I mean it'll be amazing.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.520]   I finally figured out that that's Google's entire strategy is they as long as they know
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.600]   what you're going to buy they can.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   Or where you are.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.800]   Where you are going to give you ads that you don't mind seeing because it's relative
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   to what you're doing.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.840]   So how long is it before the local the local stuff on Google actually starts to become
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.000]   accurate because I like you know sort of in my accurate entire sale and it's like wow
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I can go to Sacramento.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I'm tired of success.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   That's lovely.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.800]   Can't you just tell what your radius is?
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.560]   You can't tell what your radius is five miles.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.760]   Yeah but a lot of times it'll still spit back in more unusual and peculiar results.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.240]   Because there's always some guy in Sacramento who paid for that ad sale.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.240]   You know I don't care.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   Put him in there you know throw it in because you know.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.000]   Norton might drive out 93 miles a Sacramento.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.960]   And you know you drive it further for less than I think Norton would.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.000]   Nice for $70 a tire I want.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.360]   It's so funny though with all the wireless protection schemes we've come up with via
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.520]   web or whatever that finally we're rolling back to VPN in order to have a good secure
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   easy.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   But people have been saying that for years.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   It works though.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.520]   It works though.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   Especially in the corporate world.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520]   It's like fireworks.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.320]   Put it outside the network and have the VPN.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   Guess what?
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.920]   Throw a VPN client on it or use the one built into windows.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   Yep.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   And that's what will happen.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   We're passing around the kangroomy.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.200]   Let me actually I want to talk about an interesting story that happened in World of
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.600]   Warcraft but in order to do that we have to bring in the two more members of our twit
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   contingent.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.400]   Would you mind David and Roger letting your seats giving up your seats to Amber McArthur
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   and Jen Cutter.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   Why don't you come?
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   Come on down.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:36.720]   Amber of course is a co-host of Call for Help with Me in beautiful Toronto.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.640]   What brings you to the go ahead put your put your yeah you'll hear me better and we'll
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   get this here.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   There you go.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   What brings you to the States?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.520]   Just decided to come down for the weekend and just for the weekend yesterday went to
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.640]   your web scene conference which is pretty fun.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   It was really fun.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.400]   We actually saw a presentation by Phil Trony.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.800]   I think that's how you say last name.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   Yeah from Engagion.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   Or his make now yeah.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.240]   Yeah so it was good times and that's cool.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   Flying back tomorrow night.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.080]   We have to get ready for Call for Help.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.000]   That's right we've got a big shoe to plan.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Yes.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Well I'm glad you're here.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yes.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   How's command then going?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's awesome actually Brian our post production editor and camera.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Brian can too.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.240]   It's Beyonce, Barb they're getting married next weekend.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.960]   I saw the command and T-shirt and I thought she was just a fan.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.240]   She's in the family.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.720]   Congratulations you guys.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   That's great.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   So you're traveling the week before the wedding.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.280]   So everything's planned or you guys are loping.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.920]   So basically it's all somebody else handling it.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.200]   Okay I'm like wow you're like a wedding.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   Most people are like sweating blood and like trying to buy napkins.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.640]   Yeah I think you guys should just elope.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.160]   Cut out the middle man.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   Vegas rocks.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.760]   There's nothing more peculiar than watching a Vegas on a casino floor or watching a wedding
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.160]   on a casino floor in Vegas.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.800]   It's not a casino floor.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.360]   Do the drive through child.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   Yeah the drive through is good.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.840]   The inevitably you go on a casino there's a bride walking through going to the slot machines.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.800]   It's the strangest kind of experience I've ever seen.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   Big white dress.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   That's my dream.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Is it?
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   Good luck.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   Good luck.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.280]   Where were we at CES a couple of years ago.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:16.080]   You and I are trying to eat for the first time in 22 hours and it's like above the Venice
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.920]   fake canals and there's just like they're hammering through like every eight minutes.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   It's a pride.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.920]   Every cup they're coming up.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.760]   But there's like a guy with a Bible and like you know bam they're through and the next
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.760]   one comes up.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.640]   It's really bad at the Venetians when you have the couple especially the guy you can
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.720]   always tell doesn't like this they put him in the gondola and sing to him and drive him
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.800]   up and then they have an idiotic canal they have in there which is like way too clean.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   It's coordinated.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   Have you noticed that?
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   Did you get this chlorine coming up the canal?
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.280]   Would you rather have a dirty stinky mold filled canal?
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.840]   I smell Venice's canal.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.280]   This is much better probably.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.920]   Not as realistic though.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.760]   I'm sure they could pipe in a sense.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.280]   So you do command in is a is a internet only.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Yep.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   About 15 minutes a week.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.480]   Yeah actually we're getting up to almost 20 minutes now so 20, 22 minutes.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.640]   This recent episode which is going out tonight is about I think 16, 17 minutes.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.840]   Can you do it with Michael Azazara?
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.960]   Yeah Michael Azazara and he's back in Toronto we've put him to work and Brian and my brother
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.680]   Jeff so there's only four of us involved so it's a small swift team.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   It's good though.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   I love it.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   I want you to watch it.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   It's really really good.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   So this was our 16th episode that's going out tonight.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.840]   Do you have any idea how many people are watching?
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.080]   I don't know.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   It's hard to say.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   We kind of estimate that approximately 50,000 downloads is about what we're getting each
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.080]   week.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.000]   So again that's a bit of an estimate because of people bit torrenting the show.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.520]   And you don't know if it's mostly Canada or if it's worldwide.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.600]   Yeah we have some pretty decent stats so it's worldwide.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.560]   That's the interesting thing is there's people from all over the place watching from Australia,
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   the Netherlands, Sweden.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.400]   That blows me away too for this.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.960]   Yeah I know I love that.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   It's really really fun.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.400]   So I've met some interesting people from different places.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.560]   That's great.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.240]   And now you've met Devorak and Harren and Mwah.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.920]   I know finally I always listen to you guys so it's good to have you here.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.680]   I also want to introduce Jen Cutter who also has an internet television show called OpenAlpha.tv.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.320]   And have you done episode three yet?
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   Yes I really did.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   It's out.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   Just before I came here.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   Oh Hallelujah.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.320]   That's great.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.320]   It's a very quick one though.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.320]   You've been busy.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.840]   Yeah I shot it in the last, shot edited, posted in the last 24 hours before I got on
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   the plane.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.760]   I think it's just amazing to see this kind of emergence of all these shows.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.120]   What gave you the idea to do a show?
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.280]   I mean you didn't have any TV experience or anything right?
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   No nothing like that.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.160]   I just wanted some way to geek out about all the games and tech that I can't do locally
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.560]   because I don't have many friends who are into that.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.240]   She's a world of Warcraft player and I wanted to ask you about this virus.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.680]   Did you guys hear about this?
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.520]   In World of Warcraft there are instances right?
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   These are dungeons that occur just for that party.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.840]   So you're the only ones wandering in it.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.240]   Yeah you go in with your group and then you get your own copy of it.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.400]   So the next group behind you isn't going to be in the same dungeon.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   Which is good.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   I'm not going to be in the same dungeon.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   So what happened?
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.760]   What happened is there's a boss I'm totally going to say his name wrong but it's an
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   adult girl.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.240]   Well no one knows how to pronounce it right?
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.800]   Yeah they always have so many vowels in them.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.240]   So this boss is called hacker and what happens is when he hits you you get this corrupted
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   blood disease.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   He's the god of blood.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   So you get sick.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   You get sick and now this is easy.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   It's pretty powerful.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.480]   Well you got to be a 50 year level or higher to get even get in this instance.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.360]   So these are the top players.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.840]   You have a level 60 character yeah?
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   I get to play time.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   I give you an example.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   You have a plan for months.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   I'm a level 11.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   A level 11.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   So you got to be pretty good.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.360]   So this god is fighting you with some pretty nasty stuff.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.720]   So this disease actually does about 300 damage a second.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   Every second your health is just plummeted.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   So if you're a level 60 and you get 300 a second can you survive?
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.760]   Especially because like when you're in that kind of instance you've got like a priest
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   and a druid behind you.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.560]   The druid is going you're better you're better you're better.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.120]   But you can't cure the disease though.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   That was a cat.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.120]   So you just just pop up.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120]   It doesn't wear off.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.720]   Well that was the problem.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   Someone survived the fight.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.760]   Went back to the city with this disease.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.600]   And you've affected the rest of Azeroth.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.400]   Including the non-player characters like the Griffin Masters.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400]   They would get sick.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   They would get sick.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.400]   Oh that's so cool.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   That's awesome.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.320]   What happened is.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.480]   So these are the robot characters in the game.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.880]   They're getting sick too.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.720]   That's how realistic I guess the simulation is.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   That's amazing.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.560]   And because if you're less than a level 50 it's going to kill you right away.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.880]   Yeah I started a new character.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.640]   I mean I don't have 300 health in my whole life.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.360]   Yeah I'm at that 200 right now with a level 6.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.080]   What happens is when you die of this disease you then explode and everyone around you gets
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   that disease.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   Yes.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   It's sick.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.360]   It's the Ebola world of Warcraft.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.280]   They didn't plan it though this way.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   No not really.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.080]   The same thing happened a long time ago when someone's pet got sick and then they took
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.440]   that pet into Ironforge and the pet exploded and took out everyone in the auction house.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.120]   That just sounds like a great way to keep people coming back from war.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.280]   Now when you die in World of Warcraft you're not out of the game.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   You don't start over.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.880]   It's a 10% item durability penalty.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.520]   You just have to run back to your body from a graveyard.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   That's the pain.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   You have to go back.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.600]   You have to find your body and all that stuff.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.800]   So it's not like the end of the world.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.840]   But what was the reaction of people to this?
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.120]   I mean were people pissed off?
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.920]   Surprisingly people thought it was really cool that this could happen.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.080]   So that was Robert's reaction to plague.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   Yes.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   But you had times.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.240]   You get everybody ready for bird flu.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   Yeah right.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.480]   Avian flu we're all set.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.240]   I think what's interesting is that that's how realistic these simulations have got.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.880]   And if the programmers do something a little bit wrong it kind of acts like the real world
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.520]   and then spreads and all that.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.840]   They clearly anticipated some sort of scenario like that.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.640]   No they kind of code in there.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.480]   But did they or did they think it would stay in the instance?
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.360]   It might be organic you don't know.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.000]   I think they thought it would stay in the instance.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.680]   I don't think it was planned quite this was going to get out the same way.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.320]   Like I probably just like beat the boss on her stone back to town and then.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.760]   She was supposed to stick around and collect stuff and you know high five the other players.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.720]   Instead she went back to town and got everybody sick.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.600]   She was like typhoid Mary.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.040]   So I think what did they do to control it?
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   Did they fix it?
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.200]   Well some GMs are trying to quarantine players saying like don't leave this area.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.560]   GMs are game masters.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.920]   And so of course those players would know and what running around trying to effect as many
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   people as possible.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.920]   Watch out I'm on float.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.960]   Hey everybody party in my house.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:23.280]   So the wacky coders who left the plague code in basically now the GMs are dealing with
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.720]   the aftermath it's like okay if somebody gets it we can't we don't actually have a fix
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   for this to keep it.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.440]   They can quarantine though somehow they can also they can banish you to an area where
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   you can't.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.120]   They put you in a tree somewhere you can't get out of it.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   It's like an annoyance but a fun one.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.040]   I think that you're going to see this is a success and I think whether it was serendipitous
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.000]   or not I believe it was accidental.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.960]   It's going to happen a lot more now because doesn't it make it more exciting and more
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.680]   interesting throw in some variables like this into the game.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.480]   It's kind of cool that usually with a high level character once they're set it they're
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.520]   a permanent fixture of that game from that right on and I may have a lot of friends
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.640]   who've made good money per month selling stuff.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   What is good money.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.400]   Over say two to three thousand a month.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   That's good money.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.320]   Making two or three thousand dollars a month playing games jumping onto a brand new massive
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.720]   multiplayer game building up a character before anyone else is selling those characters.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.200]   You have to get in fast.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.720]   They buy it the day it comes out and they are just so damn good.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.680]   Just because there's more newbies in there.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.880]   Jen's like that Jen told me she could level up very very.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.800]   How much money can you make a month.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   She doesn't do that.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   Don't do it so much anymore.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   You did before.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   It's a lot of great.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   The cash was there and it's probably still a new one.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   And you make stuff too.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.240]   You learn skills and you can make things.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   She likes to fish.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   Yes.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   I like to do a fish.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   Have you ever actually fished in a real life?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   I mean like a...
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   No never.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   She fishes in the game.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   I think you should try it.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   I think you should try it.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.240]   You should try it.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   You should try it.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   You should try it.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.080]   Spend a little too much time in the book.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.840]   I thought that was a very interesting story.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.840]   I just think that we're getting...
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.560]   I think it's kind of creepy personally.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.560]   You do?
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   For some reason.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.560]   I loved Snow Crash, Neil Stevenson's classic sci-fi novel.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.320]   And really that was the first book that talked about a meta versa.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.640]   A world that is so...
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.520]   A virtual world that's so realistic that people live their lives in there.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.520]   There's an economy.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.400]   It's kind of like your place in the SvestiPul.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   They're very much like...
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.160]   It's like the barn.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.240]   But in Snow Crash they were going to send the virus back into the real world.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   That's right.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.800]   Your program was hung out in the virtual world.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   It could happen.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   So if you all start twitching and talking to you.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   No, it can't happen.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   Stay away from Jen again.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   It can't happen.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   It can't happen.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   I can't happen.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   I read too much science fiction I guess.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   Alright.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   Any other stories that we want to cover before...
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.480]   Yeah, I got the one about spam.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.040]   Oh, you get some spam.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.440]   No, actually here's the deal.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.440]   Where's your app?
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   I'm going to post this by the way.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.640]   So anyone listening should go to my blog.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   What would that be?
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.440]   And type in devork.org/blog.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.440]   Okay.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.880]   Type in a content spam.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.040]   We have a fix for blog content spam that is astonishing.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.360]   It's essentially Mark Burkel came up with it.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.480]   And what he's done is he's found a command within the Apache server command structure
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.680]   that you can...
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.040]   Which essentially do is block anybody who hits your...
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.480]   Because anyone who's got a blog that's running off of any of these systems has got content
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.480]   spam.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   And you know, you have big problems.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   It's ridiculous.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   You have some problems with that, don't you?
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   Be spam.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480]   Content spam.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.240]   Make it tell you, you know, there's all the stuff you can do.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:23.080]   Well essentially there's a simple command and I'll have the exact code posted that basically
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:28.480]   tells anybody coming into to your specific domain.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.360]   If they're not coming from your domain and they're posting comments, then it's just thrown
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.440]   away.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.800]   Because you can't really post a comment unless you're already on the site clicking on the
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   comment button.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.840]   So you're saying they're using some sort of bot to post the spam.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:47.200]   Most, it turns out because my spam on content spam went once Mark put this online, went
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:55.120]   from about 50 to 100, well 50 typically, but sometimes as much as 100 over the weekend.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.880]   Content spam hits to two.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.880]   Wow.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   Big difference.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.880]   And the two, we can't figure out how they get through.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.480]   So this is just verifying that you'd use the in page or in form.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.880]   Yeah, you're using his form instead of blasting.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   Blowing him in from outside.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.880]   You know, the post from the room.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.240]   It's simple fact Mark is stunned that no one has come up with this because you can't find
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.000]   it in the forums or anything else.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.840]   Well Kevin, you and Amber both use TypePad and they have any spam.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.440]   Yeah, it's called like Type Key or something like that.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.800]   There's a couple of different ways.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.600]   They give you the option in your account on how you would like to prevent spam.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.000]   And there's one that you can turn on like, I think it's called like Type Key or something.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Do they have to use a capture?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   You have to register.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.920]   Or you have to register as a registered user and that kind of sucks.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   It sucks.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.520]   People just comment on it because they're looking for you.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.320]   Yeah, but you know what people are not people who comment anonymously and you can't email them.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.560]   It tend to be just righteous.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.560]   Well, you have to moderate.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.560]   That's how I want to know.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.560]   That's what it is.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.720]   You have to be a registered member to post on their comments on the Twitboard.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   I think she's a very nice if people could just post.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.720]   I used to have a blogger account and I mean a lot of people just don't want to log in and
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   they just post on them.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   No, I don't blame them.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   I don't want to give you my information.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   I just use Bug Me Not.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   Log in with somebody else's info.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   Well, I should have a blogger account too.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.160]   Occasionally I'll be on somebody's blog and I want to say something and then they say
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   I have to log in.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   I hate this.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.000]   And there's a point where you say, "Do I really want to make this comment?"
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.360]   Or, "I just want to screw it.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   Let the guy," you know.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.440]   I still go in as an anonymous user if I'm posting comments anywhere just because I just
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.800]   don't want to log in sometimes.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   Right.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   I understand that.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.440]   And I wish we could do something else with Twitboard.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   We've had problems.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.240]   And they've not yet least got the anonymous coward tag.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.440]   If you want to just post anonymously.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   I love that.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.320]   But anyway, this is a pretty cool fix and it really makes I mean I'm stunned by the
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   message.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   Are you going to...
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   It just disappeared.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.320]   So he's published this somewhere.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.920]   Yeah, I'm going to put it up on my blog and put it in some forums probably tomorrow.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.320]   Steve, let's take some questions from the audience.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   What do you say?
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   Yeah, sure.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   All right.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   Audience members, here's your chance.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   They can actually hear us now.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   Can you hear us?
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   Yes.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   Okay.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   Is the show started?
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.720]   As the show started, I got a PA system and they can hear us a little bit.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   So if you've got a question, step up to the red microphone or comment or suggestion or
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.640]   if there's something you feel deeply about, anything we were talking about, please just
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.040]   step up and say hello.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   What's your name?
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Jay.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   Hi, Jay.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.680]   This is actually more a comment question.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.160]   But I saw on Dave yesterday they had a video from 1998 of you talking about the open gaming
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   machine.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   Me and Kate, somebody actually posted that.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   What's your comment on that?
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.160]   There it is.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   It was a Pentium 2.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   What was it?
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   Did you see it?
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   Yeah, it was like you were saying it was great.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   It was 128 med.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   You're never going to need more than 64 minutes.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.480]   I did say that.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.480]   Did I?
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   Oh, that's great.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.480]   You got to get me the link to that.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   It was like 4,000,000.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.160]   It was hugely expensive.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   Pentium 2 system.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.000]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   That's cool.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   So that was on dig.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   That's awesome.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Well, you know what they did?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.800]   The tech TV or G4, they just, all that video is online if you just can kind of dig through.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.920]   You just have to be careful about making these kinds of comments.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.720]   I don't think I say that.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.680]   I don't think you're ever going to need more than 100 terabytes of main memory.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   That's safe.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.240]   I'm a good guy.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   You'll be dead before you need more than that.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   Maybe not.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   Maybe not.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.880]   If you follow the Ray Kurzweil longevity method, you might live forever.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.840]   Oh, I thought I had a question.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.600]   He's just going to the bathroom.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   Any other questions?
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   Everybody go on the regular customer.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.600]   Here we go.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   Couple of guys.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.600]   Step right up.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   Fight it out.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.320]   He's got a great t-shirt.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   We'll work for bandwidth.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   I like it.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   Go ahead.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   Oh, you're a Firefox t-shirt.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.920]   I'm going to get a shot at a bandwidth.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.280]   I was wondering, are you guys going to have Marty or Megan on the show anytime soon?
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.360]   I keep inviting Megan.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.200]   She's got twin boys.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.680]   As soon as she can, she will.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   She said she would.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   Marty is in LA.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   We've invited him.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   He'll be coming up here soon.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.280]   He's doing his own podcast, though, with Joey the intern.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   Yeah, but he's still loved to be on.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   More than welcome.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   If Amber could come up--
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   This is the number one podcast, why wouldn't they?
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.560]   Why would Amber and Jen came all the way from Toronto?
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   Hey.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   He can come up from LA.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560]   Exactly.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   I think.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   Yes, and absolutely would love to have him on.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   All right.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.240]   The invitation's open to anybody who was ever on tech TV.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.240]   Anybody?
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   Anybody?
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   Anybody?
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.600]   What are you coughing about?
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   None of them.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.080]   All right, maybe not anybody.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   There are a few exceptions.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.080]   Go ahead.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   We'll work for bandwidth.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.080]   What's your name?
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080]   My name's Al.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.440]   And I always thought you were a little bit taller, Leo.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.240]   I am shorter in person, right?
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.080]   My head is huge, isn't it?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.480]   Is there a way you guys like to host some of your feeds that you read, RSS feeds?
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.800]   We could talk about them.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   We could talk about them.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   That's a good idea.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   You have a lot of good information.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   I can't find it.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.360]   That's what geeks do.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.760]   I've noticed is they'll share their RSS feeds.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.440]   Mike gave me his RSS feeds, OPML, and I gave him my OPML.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.280]   I gave most of my stuff from other people.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   I don't really do that.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   I don't have any.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   People like email you.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   People are always emailing me.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   That's the--
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.320]   That's the one thing is that when you're doing what we do, people are always sending you
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   email.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.280]   I mean, you never-- we see all that stuff always goodbye.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.480]   What do you-- do you read anything besides dig?
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.440]   No.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.760]   I actually dig care a lot of stuff.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   Digs a great resource.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   You know what we just added?
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.840]   I'll be the first to announce it here.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.080]   People don't know this, but we just added RSS to our search.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.400]   So now you can search for, say, Devorac and say, show me just the articles that have
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.680]   X number of digs under Devorac that have been promoted, and you can subscribe to that
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.640]   feed, and it creates that dynamic feed.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   Constantly.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   Constantly.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   That's a very good idea.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.040]   That could be useful in a lot of different ways.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   People are doing that more and more.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.360]   It needs to be that-- where did that mechanism come from?
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   From me?
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   Kevin and Vena.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   From scratch?
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.280]   Have you thought about-- you know, the thing-- every time I see that the way the mechanism
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:40.040]   works, because it's essentially a variation in terms of the way it attracts people, the
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.080]   way Slash.did, only as a much more modern concept.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.800]   But I'm thinking to take the exact same structure and use it in other venues.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   Oh, it's coming.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   Yeah, OK.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   It's coming.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   It's going to be subscribers.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   It's going to be an upgrade.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   There's all kinds of versions.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.560]   He's got-- can you-- are you willing to make any announcements at this point?
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   Now right now.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.200]   But we got a lot of good things coming.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.680]   There's some really exciting things.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680]   We hit Revision3 and Dig.com.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.320]   We're planning to make Future Shell Roll just a mess of money.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.720]   So there's Leo and Kate done to tease.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.200]   Oh, you're actually-- you're up pulled it up.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   It's up on Google video.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   Running a little slow.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.240]   Yeah, we don't have the greatest connection in here, especially with 18 of us all using
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.840]   our Wi-Fi at the same time.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.640]   I'll download it off BitTorrent.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.720]   Everybody else is watching that video now.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   You can stuff.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.040]   Yes, like Sproze.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.960]   So seriously, that's all you look at.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.880]   You must look at other stuff because you have to--
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:37.200]   You know, I like some of the really funky, like, you know, blogs out there.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.760]   There's one like, we make money, not art.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   Have you seen that one?
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   I like the dashes in between.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   No.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   Really cool.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   It's good name.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   Just unique stories.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.240]   I like all this stuff from like, you know, the Engadget folks and the Gizmodo folks and
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   Boing Boing is a fun time.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   Boing Boing is the greatest.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.680]   Boing Boing and Metafilter are most recent as far as I'm concerned.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.920]   Yeah, they're just wild stuff.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.080]   What do you read, Amber?
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.640]   I tend to read Waxy Links.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   I don't know if anyone else has read that.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   Oh, Lax is great.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   What's Waxy Links?
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.200]   It's basically a blog that this guy has put together and he puts, you know, four or
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.920]   five or six links every day of interesting things that are happening online.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.440]   He does a lot with Web 2.0 businesses, so I tend to read that as well as--
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.040]   Sorry, we're watching the video.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   You're so thin.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   I'll stop it.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   That was seven years ago.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   It's okay.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.120]   I read TechCrunch as well.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   That's interesting.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:31.280]   And also this other blog called RUK.ca was a friend of mine, so he always puts interesting
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   stuff.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.480]   But I also use Furl a lot as you know.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.120]   I'm on-- I subscribed-- now that's a good excuse of RSS.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.480]   I subscribe to Amber's Furl a lot.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   W-A-X-Y.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.960]   You just have to-- I don't know what the URL is offhand, but--
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.400]   We'll put it in the show notes.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   I didn't do any show notes.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   Because I didn't write about the stuff that you said in it.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   He wasn't here.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   I know.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   That's why I didn't do any show notes.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   I'm not going to do them with Patrick's.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   I'm not going to do them.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   It's just not fair.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.880]   If you know what I've been reading a lot is 43 folders.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.240]   I think you told me about it.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.240]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   It's kind of a getting things done.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   This is the new geek thing.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   You have your read this book, Dave Allen's Getting Things Done book.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.440]   You don't need to do this because you're so organized and--
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.960]   You know, you're talking to me.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.960]   Every geek.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   Every folder's that kind of--
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.960]   Every geek.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.440]   Every geek has this issue, I think, of organization.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.720]   We're all kind of looking for systems because we're systems oriented.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.560]   That's the whole thing, is this a system.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.480]   This blog, actually, is it a wiki or is it devoted to life hacks?
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   It's like lifehacks.com.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   Yeah, I love lifehacks.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   I love that too.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   That's really fun.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.400]   I'm going to get me a moloskiné.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   That's the key.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400]   Oh, I have one.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   That's the key.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   Do you have one?
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   I used to get one.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   That's the key.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   You don't know about these?
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   No.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   This is another geek fetish object.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   Yeah, tell me.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.920]   They were, supposedly, this French company used to make them.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.360]   They stopped in the '60s.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.000]   They're oil skin notebooks.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.400]   Do you have your moloskiné?
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   You can't read a moloskiné if you don't have one.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.400]   Everybody, here's these colors.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   I don't have one with me in person.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.800]   So it's a little notebook.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.200]   Apparently, you know, Van Gogh used one.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.520]   All these famous people have used them.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.800]   It has this little red black book.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.200]   It's a little black book.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   That's it.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   It's a little black book.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   It's a little black book.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.200]   It's a black book.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   It's a black book.

[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   It's a black book.

[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   It's a black book.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   It's a black book.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   It's a black book.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   It's a black book.

[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.440]   Somebody's having a conversation over Skype to record that and then convert it over to an
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   MP3.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.200]   Oh, I just saw a new app.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   It's something called Hot.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   Hot Recorder.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   Hot Recorder.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   It's good.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   It's one of the most popular.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   The problem with it is that Skype, you only get one half of it, right?
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   You get your side or you get the person's side, but to get both voices is tricky.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   There are little hacks.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.200]   There's a Windows side hack and there's a Mac side hack.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   I think they use Hot Recorder on the Mac to do it.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   It gets both sides of the conversation.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.720]   The way we always did it was with a mixer because I always had radio hardware and it's
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.200]   much easier with a mixer because then you just be recording your voice straight into
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.600]   the mixer than feeding that into Skype and then I'll record the output of the computer.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   I'm poor.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   I know.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.600]   That's the expensive way to do it.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   There's definitely software ways.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   I'll tell you what.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.800]   I'll put in the show notes.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.000]   I'll put links to Hot Recorder and I'll find the Windows technique.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.200]   There's a way to do it though.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.000]   Are you doing a podcast or you just want to record your?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   No, we're looking into it.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Okay.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Just a little sum for ourselves and our family.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   You and Chronic?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Huh?
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   You and Chronic?
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   No.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Later on eventually.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   For now I mean my cousin.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   It'll be very self-indulgent.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Is that common with power clamps though?
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Yeah, it is a problem.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   You can record yourself or the other person.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   You can't both get both sides.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   What is that?
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   You're looking at together.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   This is the one that I saw floating around that records all of your Skype conversations.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   It's supposed to be the easiest way to do it.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   What's the name of that one?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Power Gromo.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   I think it's perhaps Moloskeine.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   It's spelled by Stegen.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   It's spelled by Stegen Stegen.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   It's spelled by Stegen Stegen.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   It's spelled by Stegen Stegen.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   I'll give you the URL for the show notes.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   I'll paste it over to you.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   I'm so glad you're here Patrick.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   I don't know what I would do with that.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Patrick's the man.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Alright.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Yeah, go ahead and ask another question.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   There's only four people in the audience anyway.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   I don't want them to monopolize this.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   No, no, that's fine.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Okay.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   This is more something that I'm geeking out over and I don't know if you all talked about it much.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   But what do you see about online schools that are working with professionals?
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   The one I'm actually in now is animationmentor.com.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   But it's where you just do webcams with people who work in the business, some picks or whatever.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   And I know there's others out there.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   I just haven't checked.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Alex, you should come over at that.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Is this a mentoring program or is it an organized like six weeks to a better rendering you?
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   No, it's an actual certified school, California certified based in Berkeley.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   But it's all webcam and...
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   What's the name of the school?
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Animationmentor.com.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   It was created by people from Pixar and you work with ILM.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   What do you think of it so far?
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I love it.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   It's like I was going to a traditional school and I graduated from one and I went to one of these art schools here in the city.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   They're too expensive.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   And yeah, this one is like a quarter of the price for half the time.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And you're talking to people who are actually in there and they know you can buy a person named basis.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Shout out to Charles Onick right now if he's listening.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Might be a good way to get a job too down the road.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Yeah, well, I mean you...
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   When you're done with it, you're going to know like six people in the business who like the guy I'm with,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   he did the Yoda fights and all the Star Wars.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   And I'm sure there's a lot of good people there.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   I know there are.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   But it's a great way to do it because you actually get your foot in the door because you're working people in the business.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   And I know this is not the only one.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   So if there's others out there that haven't come out because it's a great idea.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Maybe somebody can email us.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   What's the name of this one again?
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   It's animationmentor.com.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Alex is here.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Alex probably knows a little bit about this.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   He worked at LucasArts. In fact, did...
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Lucas Fellow, sorry. Did Star Wars animation too?
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Do you know about this animation?
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Yes, animation animation mentor is fantastic.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   It's a lot...
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   It's a little different than what we do.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   When you say we made pixel core.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   The pixel core, you know, because we're really a guild.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   So we are...
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   We do a lot of training like a school would, but only because we have to to get people up to speed.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   The big thing is about 70% of our members are actually people working in the business.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   So 30% are really full-time students.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   The price is much different.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Animation mentor is really inexpensive.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I think it's like $13,000, $14,000 for the whole thing.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Instead of $30,000 or $40,000, the pixel core is $400 a year.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   But it's not a training course.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   But it doesn't do what we don't do right now currently is that hands-on, you know, like you meet, have one-on-one meetings with instructors and stuff that animation mentor does.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   So you think that's a good program, that animation program?
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   It's like sold out in like six weeks.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   What a good idea.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   It's really well done.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   And I think a lot of the schools are trying to figure it out.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   The Academy of Art, Art Institute, they all have their own online versions of what they do, but they're a lot more expensive and they don't really have the mix that animation.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   So Leo, I think maybe podcasting mentor.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Podcastmentor.com.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   I think we could do it.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Done.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   And then I chumered.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   We're the top podcast, apparently.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Apparently.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   What did you just get Kevin?
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   It's awesome.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Is that the dip-sea barley wine?
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   It's like a raspberry.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Let's say some raspberry.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Well, how did you get it?
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Did we just brought it to you?
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Yeah, so we just ran the show.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   It's poisoned.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   Have a...
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   No, I'm not a kid.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   You can tell me.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   You can tell me.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   You'll die by your wings.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   It explodes in a bloody mess.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Yeah, thanks everyone for having us.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Thanks all of us.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   It's like a raspberry.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   It's Cassis.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   It's...
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   It actually might be Cassis.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Some sort.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   That's what it is.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Oh, it's this frambuise on the side.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Frambuise.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   It's a nice Cassis, too.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   That sounds delicious.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Sounds delicious.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   We got to get the dip-sea barley wine.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   They're famous for that.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Well, that killed the conversation.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Barley wine.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   You could try that.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   I'll show you.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   You could be the barley wine guy.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Let's get another talker up here.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Another talker, please.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   All right.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I was just wondering, Devorak, what do you think about the future of Mac?
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   What do you think they're going to be doing with Apple?
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   This is this topic that keeps coming up when I say that the Mac's going to be bigger than ever because they're gone to the x86 and I just have to wait for time to prove it right.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   I think you're going to be right.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   I actually have to say I'm coming around.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   You were the...
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   I was very negative about it.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   You were very bullish.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   You were very bullish.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   I was suicidal.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Oh my God.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   It's all over.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   They got it, dude.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   I got a vice-of-war computer so they get more expensive.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   The problem is still, I think there's still a reluctance to...
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   They have a lot of bad experiences over time.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   There's a reluctance to take the full dip so they're not going to go charging into this market.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   They're going to do it like going to the waiting side of the pool and kind of work their way over.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   So it's going to be a while, but I'd say three years from now they're going to market share.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   That's what it's going to begin to double.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   So it'll go from the...
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Double?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Yeah, five to ten.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And then twenty.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   And probably they'll be a dominant player.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Twenty is pretty good.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   I can see them going to higher than that.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Really?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Well, with operating systems I think they can actually dominate.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   If they were just selling software.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   No, with both.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   In addition.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Yeah, in addition too.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Well, I think I agree.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   There will be no Apple computer in twenty years.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   There's the other side of the...
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Now finally, thanks to Amber.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   We finally...
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Usually we have all these think pads out and Amber's finally brought a Mac.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   There's finally brought a Mac to the table, which is good.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Thank you for doing it.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I hope it's okay with everyone.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   No, I know.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   We were at the Apple Store.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   We had a lineup of IBM's.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   There were no Macs in evidence.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   But all everybody sitting in the front row is all Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   The cameras are still on.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   You can humble a Windows user really quick, sitting them down in front of an Apple system and just think, try to figure it out real quick.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Is it that hard?
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   For me it's a really...
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   Really?
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   It's a so unintuitive.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Really?
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   What, the Apple?
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   No.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   You're kidding.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Don't give me the sound.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   It's easy to fall into it.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   You're going to the bottom.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   You're going to the screen.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   Try to click the start button.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Finally.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Just finally.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   You're wrong.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   You've got to be...
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Right clicking on a mouse button.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   I wish everyone could see your face right now, Leo.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   'Cause you're like, "These people are idiots.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   I'm coming out of the sun."
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   No, it's...
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   I grew up learning to program on Apple computers.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Look, but...
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Be fuddled.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   I'm befuddled.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   But in terms of the OS, it's right.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   And I tell what those people do now.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   The first thing to do is get rid of the one button mass and get a two button mass.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   But then it's exactly like...
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   And by the way, I expected two button mass to be very slowly adopted by the OS.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   This stupid mighty mass.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   I'm so sorry I bought a mighty mass.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   It's a crap.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   What a chunky mass.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   It's a crazy sight of time.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Don't use it.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Don't take it out of the autograph and give it away in the box of crap.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   There you go.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   It's not just a mouse.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   It's just a mighty mass.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   It's not just a design statement.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   The evolution of interface devices.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   It's stupid.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   I got one more can of spam to give away.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   Did you give away the other can to the Australian guy?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Yeah, he could teach you.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   You're going to have to declare that to the Australian customers.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   I don't think they're letting you bring it in.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   They're going to say no way.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   Yeah, they will.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   No way.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   No candy meat into one's party.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Actually, a lot of these customers guys, they steal it and then eat it for lunch.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   I'm going to make them once coming to France.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   Did they really?
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   You can't bring in me.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   You meet in Europe as bad he says.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   I had a salami.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   A beautiful, nice, wonderful.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Oh, so he had a nice, wonderful.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   He took the thing.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   He's right around 11.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   45.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   He's fedex everything.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   That was in a good country.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Yeah, he should have just sat there and ate the damn thing before going through.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   He's got a lot of money.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   He's got a lot of money.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   He's got a lot of slices.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Isn't that a Lucille Ball episode?
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Probably.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I think so.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   They had to eat the cheese before they got off the plane.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   I may be wrong.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   I may have fantasized that.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   All right, I'll give you the last can you wanted.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Come here.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Come here.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Take the last can.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   This isn't just spam.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   It's crazy tasty.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   Spam.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   It's crazy tasty.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   It's crazy tasty.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   It's crazy tasty.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Some macaroni cheese and spam recipe on the back too.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Yeah, it's delicious.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Well, I think we've pretty much milked this particular episode of this weekend tech.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Thank you all for being here.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   You got your hats.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   I actually want to thank some people for stuff.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   We got those great banners from Del Vanderver of express signs and graphics in Gardendale,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   Alabama.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   The hats came from Chris Haines and corporate casuals.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Should we make some of those?
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   John, you think?
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Yeah, I think you're pretty nice.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   I like them.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   Who else?
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   I want to thank AOL Radio, of course, for finding a bandwidth for this podcast, aolmamusic.com.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Next week, we're going to be at a new location.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   We haven't decided yet.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   It's undisclosed location.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.640]   And we will be starting an hour early, 3 p.m. Pacific, because Corey Doctorow will be joining
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.000]   us from Boi Barring and EFF.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   You want to do it at your place?
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   All right, everybody at Robert's back.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   I have a big deck.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Do you?
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   That might be kind of fun.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   That's great.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   That's great.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   That's great.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   That's great.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   That's great.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   That's great.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   That's great.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   That's great.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   That's great.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   That's great.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   That's great.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   That's great.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   That's great.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   That's great.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   That's great.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   That's great.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   That's great.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   That's great.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   That's great.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   That's great.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   That's great.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   That's great.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   That's great.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   That's great.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   That's great.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   That's great.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   That's great.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   That's great.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   That's great.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   That's great.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   That's great.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   That's great.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   That's great.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   That's great.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   That's great.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   That's great.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   That's great.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   That's great.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   That's great.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   That's great.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   That's great.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   That's great.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   That's great.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   That's great.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   That's great.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   That's great.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   That's great.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   That's great.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   That's great.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   That's great.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   That's great.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   That's great.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   That's great.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   That's great.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   That's great.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   That's great.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   That's great.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   That's great.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   That's great.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   That's great.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   That's great.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   That's great.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   That's great.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   That's great.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   That's great.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   That's great.
