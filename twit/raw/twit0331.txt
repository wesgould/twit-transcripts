[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.480]   It's time for this week in tech.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.200]   I'm Tom Mertvillian for Leola Porte, who is still
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.680]   flying from France.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   A lot of you may know, we were intending to do this week
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.800]   in tech from LeWeb.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.440]   And it just didn't work out.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.000]   But great coverage there.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200]   If you want to go check it out at twit.tv.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.720]   Thanks to Le Week LeMure and LeWeb
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.360]   and all those folks out there.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.960]   However, I have been asked and I'm honored to fill in.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.480]   And we got a great panel joining us on this week in tech
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.720]   today.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   First right here to my right made the trip
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.800]   all the way to Petaluma, host of Techzilla, Mr. Patrick
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.720]   Norton.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.160]   I'm so pleased to be here.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.320]   Are you?
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.160]   I don't know.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   I'm a little nervous.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.880]   You've got that Fierro look on your face.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.640]   Yeah, I probably won't bite.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.400]   We also have joining us via Skype, Mr. Ryan Block of Gadget,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.000]   GDGT.com, Mr. Ryan Block.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.520]   Hello.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.560]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   It's good to have you back.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.960]   And a guy who-- I actually just had the pleasure
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.720]   doing security now with him on Wednesday, Steve Gibson,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.280]   from grc.com.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   And of course, security now, right here on Twit.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.720]   How's it going?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   Hey everybody.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.320]   Great to be back with you, Tom.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   Good to be talking to Patrick after, I guess, last time I was
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.840]   on with you guys.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.880]   A few months ago.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.200]   Steve, what are the things in the background of your shot
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.440]   at computing?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.920]   Are we crunching numbers?
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.040]   They're just wasting a lot of cycles.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.120]   So it's an amazing amount of effort
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.240]   went into making the lights flash in a convincing fashion.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.680]   I got it.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.960]   I got it happening.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   He's down in LA.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.880]   He has to have a little Hollywood going on.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.640]   All right, let's start off, usually, on Twit.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.480]   I record something ahead of time for Leo about what's going
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.200]   on in the week ahead.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.400]   So we'll just start with that.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.640]   Today, December 11, Toshiba Thrive,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.760]   seven-inch slate officially on sale.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.080]   Speak up if anyone's excited about the Toshiba Thrive.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240]   Or if you can keep track of all the Android Slates these days.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.600]   Yeah, it's the keeping track of all the Android Slates.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.760]   Oh boy, an Android Slate.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.560]   Look, it's another 100,000 sales.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.080]   If they're lucky.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   Woo!
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.960]   Does it run ice cream sandwich?
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.920]   No, not interest.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.120]   I think that Jacob Nielsen's comment,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.200]   when he was reviewing the Amazon Fire,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.400]   his bottom line was that web-based content works well
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.960]   or can work well in a seven-inch format.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.680]   But that for generic just sort of going out
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.080]   and surfing the web, you really need more screen than that.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.180]   Or you spend all your time pinching and zooming
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.160]   and scrolling around.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.840]   It's just not enough screen for content that
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.680]   isn't targeted towards a small screen.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.160]   So we've talked about that in relation
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.960]   to the Kindle Fire, for sure.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   Precisely.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.600]   OK, coming up Wednesday, December 14,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.480]   Apple will get its HTC patent ruling.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.840]   Also on that day, T-Mobile and Nokia
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.880]   holding a mystery event.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.680]   And Judge Hovell will give her decision
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.280]   on the Department of Justice's motion
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.840]   to stay the AT&T merger trial.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.800]   We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.200]   RIM has their earnings.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.120]   I'm sorry, the Judge who Vell decision
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.600]   will be on Thursday, December 14.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.960]   That's the same day as RIM's earnings.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.360]   So there could be lots of bad news that day.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.120]   Star Wars Galaxies, the role-playing game
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.880]   set to close in advance of the new Star Wars,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.200]   the Old Republic online game that will be launching soon.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.400]   Friday, December 15, Bradley Manning goes on trial.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.000]   The iPhone 4S launches in Brazil and Russia
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.240]   and several other countries.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.360]   And Saturday, December 16, the PlayStation Vita
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.720]   goes on sale in Japan.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.160]   So that's some of the stuff coming up in the week ahead
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.040]   that we'll be looking at on Tech News today.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.960]   Let's start off our discussion here, though,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.200]   with HP's decision to make WebOS open source.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.080]   This was announced by Meg Whitman.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.880]   And then she did a little kind of a road show
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.120]   with Mark and Driessen going around
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.960]   to some of the major publications and giving interviews.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.320]   And as I understand it, they are going
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.480]   to let the community help them determine
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   what license it will be open-sourced under.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.640]   They will then hand it over to an open source community
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.680]   that they will govern.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   And they're going to let the community help them figure out
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.280]   how to best govern it.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.800]   And then they will continue to do WebOS hard work.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.560]   We'd like you to add this to the kernel.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.520]   Well, how does it help you think?
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.360]   Is that what you think?
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.520]   How do you govern open source?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.240]   That's normal.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.160]   You always have a--
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.640]   I mean, Linus Torvalds is the governing of open source.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.360]   There's nothing unusual about this.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.160]   Well, I know, but it's--
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.240]   It's a term in the open source world.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   It's called BDFL.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.440]   Yeah, but never like dictator for life.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.840]   I think it's just BFD.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.240]   You don't care, huh?
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.840]   No, I mean, does anyone care?
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.280]   I mean, I think it's clear we need an alternative to iOS
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.200]   so that there's a non-Apple majority market leading
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.720]   alternative, but we have that with Android.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.480]   And it's well-established, and it's there,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.200]   and there's a ton of developers and a marketplace,
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   and so forth.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.960]   And it looks to me like HP is going to be abandoning this.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.760]   They're not going to be putting a ton of money behind it.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.200]   And traditionally, open source platforms
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.760]   that don't have some sort of a benefactor sort of wander off
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   and just sputter and die.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.280]   How about something that's good?
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   Yeah, that too.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.120]   I know I'm going to piss off a lot of Android people,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.640]   but Android is--
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.880]   I mean, Android has a lot of things going for it,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.160]   but it does not have the clarity in terms of interface
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.080]   and sense of design that WebOS has.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.520]   WebOS is really, really nice.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.640]   But it's also had the advantage of having a single father.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.280]   I guess the problem would be with WebOS
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.920]   is that as soon as you open it up,
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   everyone starts pulling it in different directions
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.000]   and wanting to do their own surfaces on top of it,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.160]   and it starts to fragment the same way that Android does.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.240]   Well, and that's a threat to any open source project,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.120]   but I think that goes back to what you said
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.440]   about the successful open source projects
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   have had a lot more take up and a lot broader situation.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.520]   And usually started as open source projects.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.680]   And I think that's what you were pointing out, Patrick,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.320]   is HP is trying to turn this into something
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.440]   that has never been.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.160]   And that's a hard pill to swallow.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.680]   The thing it got me is the pull quote
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.320]   from the Engadget article, "WebOS is the only platform
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.760]   designed from the ground up to be mobile, cloud connected,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.360]   and scalable, so that HP CEO Meg Whitman."
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.120]   And it's like, huh?
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   You know, that's-- yeah.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.760]   Only WebOS was designed to connect to the cloud
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.160]   and scale and be able to--
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.720]   And Ryan-- Really?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.520]   Ryan, I agree with you that it is a nicer platform today.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.560]   And it would be great if it happened.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.920]   But it's just hard to see how something coming along now
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.720]   has a chance to gain traction.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.840]   I mean, it's going to fragment the Android market further.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.440]   And what's it run on?
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.480]   You know, an abandoned tablet at this point.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.920]   Well, if it runs--
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.800]   Just here's my counterpoint to that, though.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.160]   Your HTC or your Samsung or any of these other guys
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.480]   who are primary Android licensees.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.800]   Now Google, who obviously makes Android, bought Motorola.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.640]   So it's pretty clear that the winds are shifting in first party
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.000]   favorability direction.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.520]   And you're one of these guys.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.360]   You don't have control of your OS.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.480]   You don't really have the ability
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.000]   to launch a phone with a full Google suite
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.240]   without going through Google certification first, which
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.280]   is kind of a thing that not a lot of people know
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.360]   is Google's not completely open with Android.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.040]   You actually have to go get certified with them
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.080]   if you want to launch with the YouTube app and the Gmail app.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.880]   And Web OS actually presents an open source operating system
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.880]   that has many ways superior, in my opinion, to Android.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.360]   But more importantly, because HP doesn't have any skin
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.040]   in the game on the hardware side right now,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.800]   there's no agenda attached to it.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.560]   So it's actually going to be a much better alternative
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.160]   for those who want to actually go down that path,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.560]   potentially, for people like HTC and Samsung.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.280]   If Samsung-- if I was one of those guys,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.120]   I would be looking very seriously at Web OS right now.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.280]   Yeah, because HP, what they're doing here,
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.360]   I think, is very smart.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.000]   I think what they realized was we can't make a profit putting
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.840]   this out anymore.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.800]   We can't sell it to anyone anymore.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.480]   But we've got too much tied into it to just ditch it altogether.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.760]   This is our last chance.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.480]   It's basically the only choice they have.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.280]   We have a bunch of people out there using HP touch pads for $99.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.040]   We've got some more refurbs on sale this weekend.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.840]   Let's see if that's enough of a platform out there
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.120]   to make this work.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.040]   And Meg Whitman said, we're going to give it four to five years.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.920]   And very wisely, they're setting it up exactly the way
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.560]   the open source community would ask that it be set up,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.400]   with a lot of input, a lot of collaboration,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.920]   and truly open source so that they're not doing what Google
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.680]   does where they're like, wow, this version of Android
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.720]   is not going to be open source.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.480]   Next version-- oh, this one is open source.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.640]   And you just never know.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.560]   This is a truly open source project.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.400]   Whether that changes anything that you're saying,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.760]   Steve, in the end, though, I don't know.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.720]   I mean, I get why people are skeptical.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.640]   I really do.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.200]   But it's like, here are the alternatives.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.080]   Either they can completely kill an abandoned web OS,
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.800]   which obviously, I think most people don't want to see.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.360]   Or they can go on and continue failing at it,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.480]   doing what they've been doing.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.800]   I think this is actually among the better decisions
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.240]   that they could have made here.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.840]   Yeah, that doesn't necessarily mean, Steve, that you're wrong.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.080]   I think it just means that's all they had left to--
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.400]   Although I do think Ryan makes a good point
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.120]   about the idea being that for another vendor that
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.840]   is willing to pave their own way, essentially,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.040]   and wants real control over a platform where they're chafing
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.360]   a little bit with Android and Google,
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.880]   here's something that is mature and is--
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.640]   I mean, it's a beautiful piece of work.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   It's really a lot of work went into it.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.160]   It's worth not throwing away.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.240]   So I'd certainly agree with that.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.880]   Tell you what else is a piece of work.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.320]   AT&T and T-Mobile's attempt to merge.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.200]   If you've missed previously on AT&T T-Mobile merger,
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.280]   AT&T decided that they--
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.760]   because the DOJ had said they weren't going to be approved,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.840]   and they pretty much knew the FCC was going to say the same thing,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.000]   they pulled their application from the FCC
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.920]   on Thanksgiving morning in the United States,
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.440]   hoping that that would mean that the FCC report wouldn't come out.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.400]   The FCC said, we're not playing that game.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   Put the report out anyway.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.200]   AT&T got very upset and said, well, that was an ill move.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.120]   We're reconsidering our options.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.960]   We're just waiting until the Department of Justice
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.240]   is done looking over their suit against us.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.120]   Now the Department of Justice this week told a federal judge
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.200]   that the government plans to ask the court for a motion
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.600]   to stay or even withdraw the trial,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.200]   partly because AT&T withdrew their application to the FCC.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.840]   And they say--
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.200]   So the moot point.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.400]   They're going to have to resubmit that application
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.120]   if they win, and that could mean that they change it,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.880]   and that could mean that all of this is for nothing.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.400]   And Judge Hovell seemed to agree.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.240]   She said, the landscape has changed.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.720]   You could change the deal in a month,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.320]   and everybody's time will be wasted.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.200]   Or say AT&T says, they're not playing games.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.400]   But--
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   Yes, they are.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.880]   This Tuesday is the deadline for the Department
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.560]   to file its motion, and the judge
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.320]   will render a decision on December 15th.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.120]   Not entirely for nothing, though, right?
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.960]   Didn't AT&T pay $4 billion on this as a kill fee?
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.680]   Well, they will.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.600]   Yeah, it's $4 billion.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.800]   Well, it's some combination of cash and spectrum and whatnot.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.080]   That's worth $4 billion.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.920]   That if this doesn't go through, I mean, I guess a stay
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.360]   might be the best thing AT&T could get right now
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.720]   rather than a kill, right?
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.960]   Because then that puts off them having to pay the money.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.840]   OK, first of all--
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.440]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.000]   I know you're biting your chomping over there.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.440]   No, it's just the whole--
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.720]   you know, AT&T has probably more lawyers than anybody,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.640]   the planet, right?
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.160]   But we're not playing some strategic game.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.280]   One of the telcos attorneys argued before the judge
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.160]   was the line in the Ars Tectin guy.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.480]   And it's, of course, AT&T is playing strategic game.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.520]   What all the AT&T does is play strategic games.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.400]   AT&T in Verizon is about $11 million lobbying
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.840]   on the Hill last year.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.360]   There's the idea that AT&T is not paying strategic games.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.240]   It's hysterical.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.480]   They want what they want.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.520]   The AT&T says the FCC report is full of lies
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.320]   and vindictive and wrong and hurt their feelings.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.400]   You know, the whole--
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.320]   it says to mess.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.440]   The whole merger is a mess.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.280]   The idea for a merger was a bad idea.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.480]   The idea that taking T-Mobile out of the equation
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.680]   in the United States wasn't going to impact the market
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.440]   is ridiculous.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.080]   But the mobile market's a mess.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.520]   I mean--
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.360]   Yeah, the big problem here is T-Mobile dies no matter what.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.800]   Right.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.600]   I have a feeling.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.000]   I mean, Steve, what do you think?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.240]   No, I agree.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.560]   And I do--
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.040]   I'm really made uncomfortable by the idea of AT&T getting any more
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.720]   powerful than they already are.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.280]   I mean, they have a phenomenal amount of power.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.400]   And this is what makes everyone so uncomfortable
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.840]   about the idea of giving them more.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.920]   I'm going to be the lone dissenter on this one.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.240]   I think I've said this before.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.960]   I actually don't really particularly
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.680]   mind the idea of AT&T acquiring T-Mobile.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.400]   Not that it really matters a ton right now,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.280]   because that's clearly how this is looking like it's going
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.720]   to wind out.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.520]   But I mean, part of the problem is in America,
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.520]   we have this really messed up system
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.160]   with how we dole out wireless spectrum.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.320]   It goes on the market very frequently.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.200]   You basically have to rent it from the FCC
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   for an insane amount of cash.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.360]   It's very hard to get wireless spectrum.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.880]   The same spectrum that's shared by other countries
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.000]   in terms of the cellular bands.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.840]   So basically, what winds up is we
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.080]   have this massive, massive country that
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.640]   can't roll out enough wireless spectrum and infrastructure
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.120]   to support the demand.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.360]   And you see this with AT&T, how their service sucks
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.080]   in so many places.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.520]   So one way to get around that is to acquire another carrier.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.040]   Sprint did this with Nextel.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.120]   Brezen has done this with All-Tel and a number of other carriers.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.760]   So it makes sense.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.880]   I mean, if I was AT&T, I would be looking for other ways
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.120]   to get spectrum.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.200]   I don't really think that they care about the customers.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.720]   I mean, it's not like T-Mobile brings a huge enough customer
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.160]   base to really make a massive difference for them.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.040]   Well, this-- OK, so if we're assuming
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.080]   that T-Mobile's absence from the market,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.320]   we're assuming T-Mobile dies if the deal doesn't go through.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.040]   If the deal does go through, T-Mobile can no longer
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.880]   be a disruptive influence, because they'll
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.880]   be under AT&T and they'll be doing whatever AT&T wants them to do.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.360]   So if T-Mobile dies, does the spectrum then go up for auction?
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.200]   Well, if AT&T buys T&T gets the spectrum--
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.000]   It's an asset.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   They sell it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.200]   If AT&T doesn't buy T-Mobile, there's
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.320]   a chance that Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile USA,
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.040]   carves up T-Mobile and sells it off in pieces.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.920]   And one of the things they would do in that case,
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.880]   it is speculate, is that that spectrum would then
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.760]   get sold to AT&T, which is really all AT&T needs.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.640]   Or Verizon.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.600]   Well, it could go to anybody.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.640]   But the best guess is that AT&T gets it.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.320]   And then that helps them not having
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.760]   to pay that $4 billion fee, because they renegotiate a deal
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.320]   and get away from having to pay that penalty.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   And that's really all AT&T wants.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.080]   To me, isn't that the way it should end up?
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.480]   Is that AT&T gets what it needs, which is the spectrum.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.040]   But they don't get T-Mobile.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.120]   T-Mobile's going to go away anyway.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.720]   So it gets divided up to maybe some other people that need it.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.520]   The problem is we're going to lose a competitor
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.640]   in the marketplace.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.040]   Right.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.640]   So how does--
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   But I mean, is fourth place by a huge margin really
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.720]   a quote, unquote competitor?
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.240]   I mean, they're not--
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.080]   Are they third place?
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.360]   --needle and they're hemorrhaging customers
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.480]   quarter after quarter.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.360]   I'm not saying that the marketplaces
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.080]   and better with competition, it clearly is.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.800]   But T-Mobile is losing.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.640]   That's just the reality.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.680]   They've been losing for a long time.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.920]   I've heard Sprint listed as fourth place in T-Mobile's third.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.240]   But I'm not sure how they rank that.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.280]   There's lots of different ways to slice it.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.880]   But you're right.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   I mean, T-Mobile-- obviously Deutsche Telekom
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.600]   doesn't think T-Mobile USA can make a go on of it.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.440]   So in some ways, it's like, well, then they should die.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.640]   The problem is, do we see anyone else in the wings
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.080]   ready to come in and take their place?
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.880]   And that was one of the things the FCC said when they released
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.800]   their report on this was AT&T points to players like Leap
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.680]   and Metro PCS as competitors.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.960]   And they're not.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.680]   They're very, very much small regional players
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.560]   that don't threaten AT&T or disrupt the market at all.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.440]   I think that actually leads very nicely into our next story.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   Light squared is an adventure.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.800]   I've talked about it on Twitch before.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.880]   We talked about it on TNT quite a bit.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.280]   They would like to operate a satellite-based LTE network
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.480]   and wholesale it out.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.280]   I think I read somewhere today $7 per gigabyte per second
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.600]   is the wholesale rate.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.160]   They've got deals with lots of different companies,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.280]   including Dish Network, Sprint, and many others.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.160]   And so they're like, look, well, everybody else says,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   we don't want to be the dumb pipe.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.440]   We'll be the dumb pipe and we'll collect the fees
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.280]   and make the money and roll this out.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.880]   It sounds great because all of a sudden,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.760]   now we have a platform for lots of different competitors
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.280]   to come on board.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.280]   But the GPS folks have been very upset about this
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.520]   because Light squared spectrum is right next to GPS.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.240]   And it bleeds over into the GPS bleeds over
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.560]   into the spectrum the Light squared holds.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.400]   Light squared has proposed we will only use half of our spectrum
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.280]   to stay away while you adjust your GPS devices
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.120]   to not bleed over into our spectrum.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.440]   We'll try to play ball.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.080]   And they've been waiting for the FCC to approve them.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.840]   The FCC is waiting for an evaluation
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.160]   of whether this plan will work or not.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.680]   And today, Engadget reports that a leaked draft
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.920]   of the government's assessment of this
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.720]   shows that Light squared's network would interfere
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.880]   with quote to the great majority of GPS receivers.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.920]   Now this is a leaked draft course, Light squared's incensed
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.080]   that this got leaked out.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   And it also is not the final decision
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.600]   because it has to be reviewed before it's published.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.400]   Now you were earring.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.040]   Yeah, the first I first read about first time lesson
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   in Texas I was just reading about this months and months ago.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.680]   And I was like, oh my god, Light squared.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.000]   Who is this foolish company that's going to crush GPS?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And I think you start learning more about it.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.640]   And there's a tremendous amount of he said she said going on here.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.120]   But one of the things Light squared maintains
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.280]   is there's kind of like 14 different angles here.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.840]   And so if you want to see a really horrifying group of people
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.160]   that would be fighting against, Light squared is fighting
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.400]   against effectively SaveRGPS.org.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.920]   United to protect GPS and national utility
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   for more than 30 years.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.240]   And the group of people under SaveRGPS,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.840]   the coalition members list is insane.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.160]   Like aeronautical repair station association,
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.360]   ag leader, ag co, like half the agricultural businesses,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.400]   the aircraft owner and pilots association,
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.680]   I'll just randomly flick through here,
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.280]   Garmin, the fire department of New York,
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.920]   FedEx, the farm equipment manager
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.420]   and the
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.400]   electric manufacturer association,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.280]   the GAA, the experimental aircraft association,
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.720]   Magellan GPS, Lycad geosystems.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.640]   So what's going on here is the spectrum.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.120]   It's an incredible list of companies
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.960]   that are behind SaveRGPS and against Light squared.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.640]   So the spectrum that Light squared purchase
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.800]   that was approved by the FCC was originally supposed
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.120]   to be used for satellites, the Light squared deals
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.200]   are going to be, they want to display
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.720]   a zillion ground state, base stations in the United States.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.320]   - 20,000 ground stations, right?
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.160]   - Yeah.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.040]   And so the end result is that the signal's coming from here
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.000]   rather than up there, which could overlap
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.280]   with some of the GPS devices.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.560]   Light squared basically says GPS devices
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.800]   and GPS manufacturers have kind of cheaped out
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.360]   on the construction of their devices
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   and that they should not being getting interfered with.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.000]   I think what they're going to say is that the test
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.120]   was kind of a worst case scenario.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.800]   - Yeah, Light squared saying that the power levels
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.880]   were 15 times higher than those that would be used in practice
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.840]   and that it has to still be reviewed by the NTIA
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.360]   before we can be sure whether this test
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.480]   actually has the results that it sounds like it had.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.760]   - Essentially what was happening was that
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.200]   that the GPS devices, the GPS receivers
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.400]   were designed to be very inexpensive
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.040]   and they took advantage without really intending to
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   the fact that the adjacent bandwidth,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.000]   the adjacent spectrum was empty.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And so they were able to make less sensitive,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.400]   less finely tuned receivers that were able to also
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.880]   to operate at lower power, which is good for battery consumption,
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.040]   which we care about in our GPS devices.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.560]   So they're just not, they don't have the filters in them
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.560]   and the technology to reject the immediately adjacent spectrum.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.280]   And so that's the problem is that suddenly someone now
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.480]   wants to use that spectrum, but all the receivers
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.040]   that are out there like half a million or not,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.720]   yeah, no more than half a million.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   I mean, all of them are susceptible to the use
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.640]   of this adjacent spectrum that Light squared now
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.520]   wants to put a 4G LTE network up on.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.840]   - No, I had to put two, sorry.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840]   - Oh, I was gonna say well not to put two,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.480]   find a point on it, but I mean, you wanna talk about
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.920]   how the FCC, you know, a spectrum allocation system
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.440]   is totally messed up.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.280]   I mean, it's like here, buy a bunch of spectrum,
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.960]   sorry, you can't really use it for anything
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.160]   because the Air Force is operating GPS on a frequency
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.680]   that's going to be interfered by the spectrum
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.520]   that we sold you.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.680]   So this other government branch is, you know,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.280]   nagging you from using the spectrum that we sold you.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.680]   I mean, you think that they would just like give them
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.280]   some other spectrum to use that wouldn't
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.080]   - What app your spectrum?
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.880]   - Well, I mean, there's actually a lot of spectrum
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.440]   that could be reassigned and there's a ton of legacy stuff,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.680]   but it's just, it's messed up.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.320]   - So the analog over the air broadcast spectrum
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.960]   is still sitting there.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.560]   - The white space, yeah.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.400]   - Yeah.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.600]   - Yeah, it's just, there's no way to kind of get around
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.000]   this time is messed with the spectrum at this point.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.520]   So these white square guys are gonna probably gonna
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.440]   take the fall for it.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.600]   - It's a really shrill debate that's going on as well
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.080]   because there are very legitimate technical concerns
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.840]   from the GPS industry.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   And light squared has provided some very sound possible
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.680]   technical solutions.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.400]   But we still don't know if their solution is adequate
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.160]   and we don't know if the GPS industry could adjust
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.720]   to stay out of that spectrum.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.320]   But while you have legitimate GPS concerns,
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.640]   you also have a lot of industry getting in on it
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.280]   on both sides and saying, well, wait a minute,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.040]   if light squared comes along and makes a balance playing field,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.280]   that hurts our business interests
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.720]   because right now, we have a limited competition out there.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.000]   So we are going to get in behind the GPS industry
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.240]   and push them and turn this into a political issue.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.160]   And you get light squared being discussed
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.000]   on partisan blogs and radio shows
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.040]   as if it's a Republican Democrat issue.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.280]   It's been turned into a total political football
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.520]   when it's really just a very complex technical issue
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.760]   that's at the heart of it.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.800]   - Well, and light squared has said that they would operate
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.200]   at the half of their allocation,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.320]   which is farthest away from GPS
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.240]   and that in that way, minimizing interference.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.560]   And apparently that brings down the percentage of devices
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.440]   which are sloppy enough that they're still
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.320]   having an interference problem.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.160]   But to me, it sounds again, sort of like a half measure.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.920]   They really, I agree that they ought to just be moved
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.840]   somewhere else.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.600]   - You mean, who should be moved somewhere else?
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.640]   - Light squared spectrum should just be say, it's like,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.440]   we're sorry, we didn't realize that the existing
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.080]   infrastructure of GPS had been designed to take,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.280]   to sort of assume that the adjacent spectrum was unused.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.880]   We now we realize that's the case, we're sorry,
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.320]   we're going to leave it unused
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.760]   because that's the best solution for GPS.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.200]   And light squared, you can go have this chunk over here
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.800]   that'll do the job for you.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.920]   - But that's the problem is what chunk over there
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.200]   will do the job.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.040]   - Yeah.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.880]   (laughing)
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   - I think that's why--
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.320]   - There's got to be some around here somewhere.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   - And you know, light squared has been very smart.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.880]   It's striking a lot of deals with a lot of companies
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.040]   to get in on their side and help them fight this.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.280]   So I think this is far from over.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.840]   And I think this leak is something that is far
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.640]   from definitive about whether light squared
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.440]   has been found to interfere and in what way.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.560]   Don't forget the NTIA has to make that final determination
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.440]   about how many devices passed or failed
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.120]   rather than the people who made this document
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.960]   that got leaked out.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.600]   They may still find out exactly the same thing.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.000]   They may find out, yeah, this is really bad.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.800]   And then light squared's going to be up the creek.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.560]   - Apparently it's possible to do a little bit
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.920]   of retrofitting of antennas on the GPS receivers
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.520]   to add sort of a physical filter at the antenna
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.240]   so that it solves the problem, you know,
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.320]   up in the receiver too.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.400]   - I think it's completely impractical
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.320]   in real life use, especially on like mobile devices.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.000]   - No, it'd be just like the digital TV transition, Ryan.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.080]   It'd be just that easy.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   - Yeah, how's it going to happen?
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.240]   - Right, not a problem.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.880]   - Yeah, there's, there may be, there may be in theory,
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.920]   there may be a way to retrofit the devices,
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.880]   but the reality is that, you know,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.520]   one of the things light squared says is like basically,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.360]   they built, you know, one of their VPs actually,
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.720]   there's kind of a great story up on light squared,
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.960]   where they're basically like, yeah,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.520]   the GPS industry bled all over the spectrum.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.880]   They didn't pay attention.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.640]   They didn't put in inexpensive parts
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.600]   that would help filter signal interference
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.160]   and work it in screwed for it.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.360]   But yeah, I can't imagine somebody like, you know,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.600]   disassembling the GPS system on a tractor
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.960]   or a harvester or something.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.920]   There's just, it's a mess.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.280]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.960]   Light squared is even valid volunteer to pay for part
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.800]   of the rollout of such a thing,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.960]   but nobody else is jumping up to pay the rest of the bill.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.240]   - So yeah, the jury is still out on that.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.720]   Let's take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.960]   of this weekend tech, GoToMeeting.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   This time of year, holidays, bad weather, sick days,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.080]   it can be impossible to get everybody in the same room
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.920]   for a meeting.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.520]   We can't even get Leo and his producer,
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.040]   Eileen to come in and do a twit.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.240]   Chad Johnson's over there, Leo, Eileen's sick,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.480]   Leo's on a plane.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.840]   It's always difficult.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.480]   That's why we recommend GoToMeeting by Citrix.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.240]   With GoToMeeting, you can host your meeting online
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.680]   from any computer while your attendee's joined
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.080]   from anywhere, their computer, their iPad,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.920]   their iPhone, their Android device,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.080]   whether they're traveling, snowed in or home with a cold,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.920]   GoToMeeting makes it easy to join meetings

[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.320]   The video quality, clear, natural,
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.680]   it's like being in the same room,
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.520]   and it's easy to use.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.000]   All you need is an internet connection.

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.760]   That's T-W-I-T, GoToMeeting.com.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.040]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.920]   So Microsoft had a big week.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.080]   They unveiled their new Xbox dashboard
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.240]   and their new Windows 8 App Store.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.400]   Let's actually start with the Xbox dashboard.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.040]   They released the embargo on Monday.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.360]   Everybody had their reviews out.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.760]   Everybody was talking it up.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.440]   And then Tuesday morning it didn't come.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.640]   And Tuesday afternoon it still wasn't here.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   And then finally, late afternoon, early evening,
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.040]   depending on where you lived,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.520]   it finally started rolling out.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.680]   You're an Xbox user, right?
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.760]   Ryan?
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.600]   - Oh yeah.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.200]   - What do you think of the improvements here?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.000]   It's more Metro style, a lot more options for search
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.440]   and video, the improved the way Connect works.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.960]   Is it as promised?
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.400]   - So far I think so, yeah.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   And many of the common features are more quickly accessible.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.560]   And the new beacon system is actually really nice.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.400]   - What's the beacon?
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.240]   - I've been seeing anything like it.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.400]   You can basically set up to kind of automatically alert people
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.040]   on your Xbox friends list
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.360]   that you would like to play a certain game.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.680]   So it used to kind of be,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.480]   and I think with PlayStation, it's this way as well.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.920]   If you wanna play a game with somebody,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.840]   you have to see them come on.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.760]   And then you have to see them join,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   like you know, start playing a certain game or not,
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.040]   but you can, you know, it helps if they are.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.800]   And then you would like send them an invite,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.000]   and then they would come in and play the game with you.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.840]   With the new beacon system,
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.920]   you would just say like, tell all my friends automatically,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.080]   hey, come play this game with me at all times.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.000]   So when you come online, instead of them just seeing,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.280]   hey, Ryan just logged on, it says, Ryan logged on,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.440]   and he would really like to play modern warfare through
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.080]   with you or battlefield through with you.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.200]   - That doesn't make you look too needy.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.800]   (laughing)
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.600]   I think it's done in a clever way.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.800]   - Good, that's cool.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.120]   And then there's also the Windows Phone integration.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.560]   If you're a Windows Phone user,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.720]   you can start and, you can play some games on,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.480]   using the Windows Phone as a controller,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.760]   start some games on the Windows Phone,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.960]   finish them on the Xbox.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.880]   A lot of video stuff in here too,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.640]   in some situations around the world,
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.400]   you'll be able to watch television shows on the Xbox
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.840]   that you get over cable.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.560]   It varies depending on where you are,
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.240]   and it's rolling out from different services
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.120]   at different times.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.760]   But here in the US, I know we're getting Comcast
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.320]   on demand is coming later,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.880]   and Verizon, Fios, subscribers will get 28 channels.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.760]   I think they finally got them later this week,
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.040]   or did they end the late part of the week.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.800]   But have you tried any of the video stuff,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.360]   supposedly if you say connect,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.080]   being, find the show,
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.600]   it'll just tell you all the different places
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.200]   that it's available.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.720]   - I haven't yet 'cause I've Comcast,
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.480]   and I'm dying for the HBO Go support.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.800]   I really can't wait till they add that.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.320]   I think that's coming in the spring.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.200]   But yeah, I mean, it's funny
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.640]   'cause if you actually go back in time,
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.560]   this was part of Microsoft's vision for Xbox
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.840]   for a very, very long time.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.360]   I mean, they had U-Verse support a really long time ago.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.480]   In certain parts of Europe,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.080]   they had IPTV streaming to the Xbox for a while,
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.480]   I think through Sky.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.400]   So is this something they wanted to do for a zillion years?
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.120]   And I'm glad they're finally kind of getting to it,
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.160]   even if it wasn't exactly the way
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.960]   they had originally intended.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.360]   - Now, there's also a report today
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.280]   that Microsoft is seeking executives
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.040]   to develop original Xbox programming.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.000]   They actually do a little bit of that already.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.360]   That's one of the things Major Nelson does there.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.160]   But Bloomberg reports the company is seeking
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.520]   an executive, former NBC executives
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.840]   with the idea of making short film pilots,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.120]   or actually going beyond making short film pilots.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.960]   They previously have done that with Peter Safran.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.000]   So this is all part of what seems to be Microsoft
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.920]   strategy to become that box,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.520]   that one way that we combine all of our video
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.560]   watching on our television,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.640]   whether it comes over the internet
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.520]   or over cable or elsewhere into one place.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.800]   And of course, everyone wants to be that, right?
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.440]   We got Google TV, we got Apple TV, now we've got Xbox TV.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.960]   - Well, I think there's a big difference between
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.440]   Google and Apple, I don't think they,
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.680]   I don't know, it's interesting to watch YouTube
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.960]   starting to develop channels.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.560]   The idea of Xbox being like,
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.800]   okay, we're gonna develop really lucrative series
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.600]   to draw people into the truth is,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.960]   is Apple TV, it's all about the content deals
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.240]   and making it three clicks,
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.480]   if not one click from when you pick up
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.400]   the remote control to watch your program.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.920]   I don't really understand why Xbox or why Microsoft
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.320]   would wanna create original programming,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.400]   it just seems like getting the content
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.240]   onto the machine and into people's houses.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.760]   I mean, I will buy, somebody comes over to the hardware box
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.600]   that'll allow me to watch legally watch HBO content
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.760]   without having to be subscribed to say,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.800]   satellite or cable, I'll pay 25 bucks a month
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.600]   to watch HBO without having to have cable,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.040]   but nobody seems to be able to make that deal, HBO is not
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.800]   - Boops, Boops from Time Warner has said,
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.040]   we will never do that.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.600]   HBO will be always associated with a television provider,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.200]   we will never market it directly over the internet.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.040]   You said that early last week.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.680]   - Okay, I hadn't, I guess that one.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.080]   - That's why that deal's not made.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.720]   - A few months ago it was,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.320]   we're not gonna do it for eight bucks a month,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.920]   but we might do it for 25 bucks a month.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.760]   - They changed their tune,
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.080]   no that doesn't mean they won't change their tune again.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.920]   - We'll change it again.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.760]   - Yeah.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.560]   - I think the idea of having original programming is,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.440]   we want to be that box and that's one of the ways
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   we get a leg up is if we can say we provide Netflix
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.800]   and all of their original programming
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.040]   that they're gonna be doing,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.920]   we provide a Zoom marketplace so you can buy shows,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.880]   we provide the ability to get crackle
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.080]   and all of these other services
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.560]   and we integrate with your cable television provider
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.720]   and we provide shows you can't get anywhere else
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.040]   except on the Xbox.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.400]   - Right.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.600]   - That's everybody's theory anyway.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.400]   - Yeah, I would say given how difficult it is
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.800]   to have a hit show that anyone cares about
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.480]   and we'll wait and see if there's anything there.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.000]   - Yeah, actually Microsoft already has one on the Xbox,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.800]   it's the Guild.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.040]   - That's right, actually.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.840]   You know what, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.360]   This isn't the first time,
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.160]   beyond Major Nelson that they've done this.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.880]   It just seems like they're stepping up
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.520]   their salary requirement essentially
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.680]   by approaching NBC executives
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.400]   'cause that's good quality stuff with the Guild on there already.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.160]   - I found something else good from Kessler,
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.760]   the co-president from HBO.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.720]   He says that cord cutting is a temporary phenomenon
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.880]   that will go away once the larger economy improves.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.720]   - Yes.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.560]   - Yes.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.200]   - And the housing market will never fall.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.640]   - I'm sure he's on the right side of history with that one.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.480]   - Yeah.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.440]   (laughing)
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.400]   - The stocks will never come down.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.800]   The housing market will never bust.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.480]   - Oh, it's so cute.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.960]   - It's so cute.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.880]   - It's so cute when people say things like that.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.120]   It's adorable.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.720]   - Now Microsoft also made a big deal
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.360]   about their new Windows 8 App Store
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.000]   that will be coming with the beta of Windows 8,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.160]   which by the way, we're gonna get a beta of Windows 8 in February.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.040]   The App Store is going to be like the Mac App Store.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.240]   You'll use it on the desktop or tablet
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.160]   with the Metro interface.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.360]   You'll be able to buy all the Metro style apps
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.080]   directly from the store and install them.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.040]   They'll have desktop style apps available
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.800]   that you'll then be click through
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.120]   and go to the vendor of those particular apps.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.760]   And the apps will range in price from a buck 49
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.640]   up to $999.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.520]   Now remember, the reason there's not a lot of 99 cents apps,
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.400]   this is Windows 8, which is a desktop system,
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.800]   although it's gonna be on tablets.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.160]   So it seems weird that they've got a minimum price
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.360]   at a buck 49.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.400]   Trial versions of the apps will be available
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.840]   so that you can just try an app for 30 days
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.160]   and then decide to buy it later if you want.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.360]   devs will be able to use app certification kit.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.760]   This is part of their big pitch,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.560]   which is you'll actually know before you submit the app,
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.200]   whether it's likely to be approved
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.800]   and will tell you where the app is
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.960]   in the approval process.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.720]   That's been one of the complaints about Apple.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.840]   - With Apple, yeah.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.400]   - Plus the payment structure, Microsoft takes 30%,
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.120]   dev gets 70%, that's pretty standard.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.720]   However, - Till an app reaches 25,000
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.480]   and then Microsoft drops it to 20%.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.320]   - That's a really clever, that and the $1.49 actually.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.360]   That's the $1.49 is because Apple was at 99 cents.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.600]   So by making the minimum price higher,
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.040]   it's going to increase revenue,
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.240]   or at least I guess that's the assumption.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.600]   At very least, it provides the impression
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.160]   that that application is more valuable on that platform.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.280]   - And the assumption is nobody's really, really clever stuff.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.160]   - Nobody's going to not install Windows
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.760]   because the App Store has a minimum of buck 49.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.600]   (laughing)
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.800]   - Right, exactly.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.360]   - And Angry Birds will be there probably at launch.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.960]   (laughing)
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.520]   Well yeah, that's the hello world of running an App Store
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.800]   is you have to have Angry Birds.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.960]   - Pretty much.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.200]   - It is the new Doom.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.000]   - It is the new Doom, exactly.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.480]   I don't know if there's anything else to say about this
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.920]   till we actually get a chance to see it,
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.520]   but it is pretty clever of Microsoft
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.600]   to address on the developer side
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.240]   many of the complaints of App Store.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.840]   - No, you just have to make Windows 8 usable
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.800]   on the desktop without a touch screen.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.200]   - Well, is Windows 7 usable on the desktop?
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.240]   - I love Windows 7.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.120]   - Then Windows 8's going to be usable on the desktop
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.280]   'cause that's what you just,
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   you just blow around and ask that Metro interface.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.120]   - Well, let me first,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.120]   I want Metro to be usable on the desktop.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.520]   - Ah, well that's asking something else.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.480]   - Yes.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.800]   - Well, I play, wait, wait, wait, Patrick,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.000]   you want Metro to be usable on a desktop?
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.800]   - I want them to make it so I can use it with a mouse
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.320]   and keyboard without wanting to weep with frustration.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.880]   Right now, Metro is so obviously a touch screen interface.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.560]   It was just, it was to have it installed
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.560]   on a desktop and to that be the first thing you see
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.520]   when you hit Windows 8,
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.360]   just made you want to hurl my computer
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.760]   through the nearest window.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.200]   - Right, so I would just say,
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.960]   don't install Windows 8 and Metro,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.280]   stay with what you love.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.960]   I mean, I'm still using XP.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.160]   - Right, and happy.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.480]   - I don't love XP.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   - I have 48 days left of Microsoft support for X.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.080]   So I'm in no hurry to leave.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.560]   - You're a man that's going to ring every last ounce
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.600]   of value out of XP and I commend you for that, sir.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.240]   - And I get to skip over Vista in the process.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.880]   Eventually I'll probably go to seven,
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.840]   but I completely avoided that whole mistake called Vista.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.720]   So yeah, I'm looking at eight, I just look at it,
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.280]   I just think, what a joke, what a toy.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.720]   - I think it'll be interesting
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.600]   whether or not to do anything in Windows 8
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.120]   that compels anyone, any desktop user to upgrade
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.520]   from Windows 7.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.480]   - I mean, so far, all they've done is to prevent it.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.920]   (laughing)
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.680]   Exactly to your point.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.600]   - I have a feeling that what they're going to do
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.720]   is they're going to give Enterprise the option
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.520]   to turn off the Metro interface.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.960]   And then there'll be some other hooks
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.200]   to try to get you to upgrade.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.680]   But I don't think anybody who currently runs Windows
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.360]   7 is expected to upgrade to Windows 8.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.840]   Windows 8 is there so they can sell a lot of tablets.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.560]   - And they can't even Enterprise off of XP.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.080]   I mean, XP is still the dominant platform in the world.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.920]   - That's true.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.160]   - There's more XP than anything else
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.640]   'cause Enterprise just saying, hey, it works.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.960]   It does what we want, we know what it is,
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.600]   why would we move?
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.360]   - This is something that Apple actually figured out
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.960]   in terms of selling operating systems to end users.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.040]   Make it cheap.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.360]   Just make it really, really cheap
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.680]   and people won't be able to talk themselves out of an upgrade.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.520]   - They'll upgrade to Snow Leopard if it's only 30 bucks.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.440]   - It's not that big of a deal.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.840]   30 bucks, not that big of a deal.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.160]   - Yeah, but Apple also--
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.760]   - Everybody can afford 30 bucks for a new OS.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.680]   It's different from Windows which you can get
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   can cost like hundreds of dollars.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.320]   - Right, but Apple also has the advantage
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.920]   of basically drawing a line in the sand
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.400]   every three years and ignoring all of their older legacy
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.520]   hardware at that point, which is not an advantage
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.560]   that Microsoft has ever held in the market.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.400]   - So what you're saying is that Microsoft can't afford
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.360]   to release Windows to end users for--
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.440]   - No, no, no, what I mean is Apple is such an unusual
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.680]   situation where basically they, compared to Windows,
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.800]   Apple just ignores all of its older hardware
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.640]   every three years.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.840]   It just walks away from it.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   And then eventually people buy hardware
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.600]   to replace their old hardware so they can have applications
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.000]   that can run or software updates and stuff.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.840]   - Well, and for example, I mean, imagine moving
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.520]   from one processor platform to a different one.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.480]   You know, they dropped the power PC and said,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.280]   "Oh, we're gonna go Intel now
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.880]   "because Intel has obviously got a future."
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.920]   - That was the best moment I've ever had
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.080]   in an Apple press event.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.320]   And maybe in the last Apple press event
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.480]   I got the chance to attend, but there was literally like
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.880]   that announcement came out.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.800]   It was like 300 people had been sucker punched
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.440]   'cause it was just like, (gasping)
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   because they had all been fed the rumor for so long,
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.480]   the lies, the completely bogus benchmarks
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.880]   that power PC was kicking Intel's ass.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.960]   And all of a sudden they were being told
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.920]   that Intel was the future.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   It was incredible to be in that press event.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.680]   And just to listen to, just it was like literally
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.240]   like a bunch of people have been sucker punched
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.520]   in the gut and then dead silence.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.480]   And then you watch Steve ramp up the reality distortion field
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.080]   to maximum 'cause he had to sell that entire room
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.240]   on the future of the platform.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.360]   It was really fun to watch.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.320]   - You know, I wonder if Microsoft is at all worried
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.480]   about losing their dominance
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.560]   on the operating system platform though.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.920]   I mean, they don't have to sell a ton of new Windows 8s
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.600]   to maintain dominance.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.280]   And that's really what they want.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.160]   And then they can continue to try to get enterprises
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.360]   to move along to whatever, whether it's Windows 7
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   or Windows 8.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.000]   I think Windows 8 is a ploy to say,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   "We need to eat into that tablet market.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.760]   That's what we're actually worried about.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.160]   We'll maintain our dominance on the desktop,
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.200]   but we need to be on more tablets."
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.920]   - They are, you could argue, I think,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.360]   that they've lost their dominance
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.880]   in the infamous browser wars.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.240]   'Cause I mean, we really, you know,
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   Google is coming on strong with Chrome
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.280]   and Firefox is chewing into their market share.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.560]   And IE's market share is dropping, isn't it?
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   - Yes, by some-- - Actually, it's on the way up.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.520]   It's been back on the way up in the last couple of months.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.880]   - I thought the last-- - Firefox is losing the quickest.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.360]   - Well, I thought the last I saw was that IE
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.760]   had dipped below 50% for the first time.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.840]   Was that mistaken?
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.560]   - Well, I mean, it's also like,
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.040]   these are one of those things where it depends on
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.480]   if you're looking at global or US,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.640]   but IE is actually not in horrible, horrible shape.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   Not that I particularly love it or--
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.840]   - Yeah, no one here would ever use it.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.400]   Yeah, no, I-- - But yeah, I use Firefox on Windows.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.560]   - I agree, Tom, I think in general,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.320]   Microsoft has got to be worried
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.640]   because they're just our moral alternatives
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.200]   and there's increasing fragmentation in the market.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.760]   And look what's happening with mobile.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.840]   Everyone's now talking about,
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.160]   that's where the, ultimately that's where the future lies
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.320]   is in mobile stuff.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.600]   And Microsoft is still nowhere there.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.840]   - I think 20 years, most of the world's gonna get it.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.480]   It's most of the, most, you know,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.760]   when you get up to the point where there's like
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.920]   three billion, four billion people use the internet,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.400]   five billion people use the internet,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.720]   most of those people will be on a mobile platform.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.080]   Most will be a relatively inexpensive cell phone
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.920]   or maybe if they're lucky a tablet.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.280]   And yeah, I think Microsoft, whoever's looking,
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.600]   whoever has like the sort of 50 year event horizon
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.160]   hat on it, Microsoft has to be freaking out about
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.040]   just their complete lack of a presence
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.400]   in that market other than Bing.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   - I feel like Metro is them making the same mistake
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.040]   they made with the Zoom all over again,
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.600]   which is coming up with the right product
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.560]   for the last product cycle.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.840]   It's, if Metro was out right now,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.160]   I think they would be doing well.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.480]   I don't think they would be top--
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.280]   - But Metro is out right now, it's Windows Phone 7.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.240]   - No, but that, I mean, as a tablet operator,
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.800]   I'm speaking specifically as a tablet operating system.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.520]   If it was out, they would be taking some market share
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.440]   from Apple, but by the time it actually comes out,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.560]   which our best guess is next fall,
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.400]   I'm not sure that the tablet market won't have moved on
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.840]   and it will seem quaint.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.360]   - Now I wonder what the other tablets are gonna look like.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.520]   - It's so difficult to right click on a tablet.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.960]   - All those web OS tablets will be dominating.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.320]   (laughing)
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.440]   Let's change gears and go to a story
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.000]   about an Oregon judge handling the case
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.480]   of a woman named Crystal Cox from Montana.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.520]   She started several websites accusing
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.680]   Obsidian Finance Corp and its principal, Kevin Padrick,
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.440]   of misconduct in their handling of a bankruptcy case.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.960]   And the URLs were rather provocative.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.920]   Obsidianfinance sucks.com,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.240]   bankruptcytrustyfraud.com,
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.200]   Oregonshyster.com.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.800]   In January, Padrick filed a defamation lawsuit
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.640]   against Cox, charging that her accusations were false
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.080]   and asking for $10 million.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.200]   The court found Cox guilty of defamation,
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.920]   awarded Padrick $2.5 million.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.520]   Oregon law requires victims of defamation by journalists
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.760]   to first request a retraction and Padrick had not done so.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.320]   So Cox asked the judge to set aside the verdict,
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.240]   claiming she was an investigative blogger.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.160]   This week, Judge Marco Hernandez disagreed, said,
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.880]   "Although the defendant is a self-proclaimed
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.920]   investigative blogger and defines herself as media,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.000]   the record fails to show that she is affiliated
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.040]   with any newspaper, magazine, periodical book,
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.120]   pamphlet, news service, wire service news,
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   or feature syndicate, broadcast station,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.960]   or network or cable television system."
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.040]   He's basically quoting how Oregon law
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.400]   defines what a journalist is and says,
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.320]   "Thus, she's not entitled to the protections
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.880]   of the shield law in Oregon."
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.560]   - And so the salient issue for us is
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.040]   that bloggers are not journalists.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.040]   - Well, there's this, yeah, there's, this is,
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.400]   I wish I could find it.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.480]   There's a really good write up on this.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   The blogger in question, like one of the article
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.440]   I'm taking over is basically like,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.320]   "Blob a sphere, you may not want to claim
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.560]   this person as one of your own,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.120]   because this is somebody who is running a large group
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.160]   of sites to promote SEO, which isn't that particularly
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.640]   honoris, had maybe offered, you know, basically this guy,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.920]   this, nobody can quite figure out why,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.120]   or the writing is a little sort of over the top,
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.680]   like frantic in the sort of,
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.320]   gosh, I'm glad this person doesn't live next
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.480]   to my house kind of way."
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.440]   (laughing)
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.600]   - Maybe the patient would be used.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.120]   - Well, yeah, well, it's, you know,
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.200]   maybe called up and offered services to, you know,
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.960]   sort of fix the problem to the company in question.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.440]   - Yeah, I'm starting to get a report of an email
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.560]   that was made available in court,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.360]   where she had offered to charge them
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.520]   for some kind of service that would remove
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.960]   the sites in question, essentially.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.960]   - Yeah. - $2,500.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.640]   - I mean, I will agree that there's an issue
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.400]   with Oregon law, because Oregon law,
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.000]   current Oregon law needs to be corrected,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.960]   because, you know, if, in or under Oregon law,
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.120]   if you're not affiliated with a newspaper, magazine,
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.840]   periodical book, pamphlet, news service,
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.120]   wire service, news or features,
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.520]   send to get broadcast station or network,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.120]   or cable television system, you are not a journalist.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.720]   - Well, so Oregon law doesn't--
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.520]   - But when is it periodical?
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.880]   - The Oregon law says, such as--
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.000]   - So okay, so okay. - And then list all these things.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.480]   So there is wiggle room in there,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.320]   the judges didn't choose to use it.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.400]   - Yeah, that said, what this particular individual
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.840]   has been doing is, what Cox has been doing,
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.280]   I would not consider journalism, it's ranting.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.640]   And it's ranting to a purpose,
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.320]   which may or may not have been to receive monies
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.720]   from them, 'cause this guy,
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.680]   this guy, Patrick, who's running Obsidian,
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.320]   and I don't know whether Obsidian maybe
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.360]   is Scumbaggy, a financial company, I have no idea.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.240]   They may be wonderful people, but they were in receivership.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.320]   Patrick was assigned to basically run it
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.960]   to deal with the bankruptcy things.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.280]   And he's like, I can't, you can no longer
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.040]   search in my name without having the Upteen websites
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.920]   as women created, coming up top of the fold
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.480]   under my name, and my online reputation
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.040]   is permanently ruined.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.320]   There's like 1900 websites Cox has created
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.880]   to write about people and companies.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.360]   This is, you could argue that this is a reputation
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.320]   destroying network that has been very solidly engineered
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.120]   under SEO to be able to hammer.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.000]   - Point targets.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.120]   - Well, and there's several valid questions
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.480]   about what laws would kick in,
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.240]   even if she did qualify for the shield law,
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.280]   she may have still been found guilty.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   It's just interesting to see all the headlines saying,
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.520]   bloggers aren't journalists according to Oregon.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.800]   And I'm not sure that that's actually what the judge is saying.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.000]   - And bloggers, at least in my experience,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.440]   the bloggers that I associate with don't send out,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.160]   and this is the Forbes that the email that Forbes pointed to,
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.840]   don't send out investigative bloggers,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.120]   don't send out emails that say,
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.600]   "I want to let you and Obsidian Finance know
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.760]   "that I am now offering PR services
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.360]   "and search engine management services
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.480]   "starting at $2,500 a month to promote law firms,
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.160]   "finance companies, and to protect online reputation
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.360]   "and promote businesses."
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.560]   Please let me know if TorqueCon,
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.360]   TonCon, Torque, or Obsidian Finance is interested
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.200]   in this service, thanks for your time
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.000]   in love and light, Crystal L. Cox,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.840]   investigative blogger, real estate broker, owner.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.680]   - That's sweet.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.920]   - Yeah, sounds like you might be getting light.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.320]   I also don't want to get on the long side of this woman, so.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.160]   (laughs)
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.000]   - Yeah.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.480]   - I think one interesting thing to point out though
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.880]   that doesn't get mentioned a lot is that
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.160]   Shillblad does not mean that you can say anything.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.000]   - Right.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.680]   - Does it mean that you as a journalist or blogger
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.000]   or any person can just defame companies willy-nilly?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.440]   You actually, like, if I write for the New York Times
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.440]   and I write something defamatory about a company
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.240]   or an individual, I'm still, you know,
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.560]   how the accountable for that.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.880]   - Yeah, there's a different burden of proof,
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.400]   but you still can't just go and defame people.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.240]   - Right.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.080]   - Yeah.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:35.920]   - Which is why, you know,
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.520]   you have editorial practices and guidelines
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   at most professional publication.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.760]   - Well, to me, that's what these stories are all about.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.600]   This isn't the first time a court has ruled about a blogger
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   and whether they were a journalist or not.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   My thing is always, it doesn't matter
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.160]   whether they were using a blogging platform or not.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.320]   The question is, is the person in question a journalist?
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.160]   And I think it's fairly clear from some of the things
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.880]   we've said that this person was not acting
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.480]   as an investigatory journalist,
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.440]   no matter what she said.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.520]   - But they sure as hell don't want to be nailed to the floor
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.640]   for saying nasty things about somebody else
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.880]   that they can't prove or true, which is essentially
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.720]   defamation.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.680]   If you can't prove it's true and you say something nasty
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.040]   about somebody, it's pretty much defamation.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:13.880]   - Well, unless you're a journalist,
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.240]   then you have to prove actual malice, I think.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.520]   So, you know, it gets tricky in there.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.880]   And I don't want to say too much
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.120]   without having our lawyers around.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.080]   Where is I as anyway?
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:23.920]   - Right.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.720]   - He's on Tech News today, later this week.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.080]   We actually talked about this then too,
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.040]   but yeah, it's an interesting question.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.520]   But I think I wanted to bring it up simply
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.720]   because so many headlines make it look like
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.600]   something that it isn't, I feel right.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I was very confused by the CNET headline
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.440]   on this, which makes it, you know,
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.040]   it pains it very much in like this person as a blogger.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.560]   And like, it's, and rule that this blogger
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   does not kind of as a journalist,
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.120]   and therefore it is not applied to Shoban.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.640]   It doesn't really go into any of the actual
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.440]   important details, which are like,
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.760]   this person is clearly very crazy seeming
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.440]   and is doing things that are clearly very untoward seeming
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.160]   and that journalist, blogger, otherwise,
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.880]   I don't think that this person is going to be getting
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.760]   very many protections of any kind.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.120]   - All right, we're gonna take a quick break,
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.680]   then we're gonna talk about Firefox's fate.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.520]   It's often seen as being in the hands of Google,
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.240]   and that may be questionable right now,
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.160]   but we wanna thank another one of our sponsors,
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.360]   and Leo LePorte has not entirely gone from this episode.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.240]   He's like laying out jewelry over there.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.400]   What is that, Leo?
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.520]   - This is from ice.com, guys.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.400]   Christmas is coming in while we all love gadgets.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.360]   If you wanna talk about lasting memories
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.280]   for the loved ones in our lives,
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.640]   we gotta face it, jewelry, right?
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.400]   Because it's something that lasts,
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.960]   and you can create a special lasting moment with your
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.480]   love of your life with some very cool, or your mom,
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.240]   or your sister with some very cool,
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.920]   high quality jewelry from ice.com.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.080]   Look at this, this is a beautiful pearl,
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.760]   one seventh carat black diamond and pearl
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.120]   with 10k white gold.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.960]   Now this pen is $125.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.440]   Ice has amazing prices,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.600]   but in just a bit, I'm gonna tell you
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.360]   how you can get it for $87.50.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.600]   Show 'em this are these beautiful pink gold rings.

[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.840]   We've been having fun during the holidays
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.880]   every year with the ice jewelry.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.320]   We hate to send it back.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.880]   Maybe we'll pick up some for the people of their studio.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.720]   Let me see this one.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.840]   Is this one of your favorites?
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.760]   This is the one.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.920]   That is beautiful.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.400]   That's the pearl.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.160]   That's the seventh carat black diamond and pearl
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.400]   with 10K, white gold pendant.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.160]   That's like a natural, is that a fresh water?
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.240]   Must be fresh water pearl.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.760]   That's beautiful.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.600]   I love that.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.840]   Get ready for this.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.040]   Normally, $125 is $87.50.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:10.880]   That is gorgeous.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.520]   Ice.com/twit.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.320]   Leo will be back in the chair next week.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.240]   Good to know.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.160]   And he's actually on a plane right now.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.880]   That was-- we switched.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.080]   Usually, I pre-record and pretend I'm live with the week ahead.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.840]   So we just swapped this time.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.520]   All right, let's--
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.360]   Don, tell me where an angel are you got an earring in?
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.440]   I am wearing this lovely earpiece from--
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.040]   Is that a nice time I'm trying to piece?
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.360]   No, it's not.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.280]   That's why it's ugly and looks like plastic.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.520]   It's a fresh water earpiece.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.760]   Fresh water, IFB.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.640]   Firefox facing an uncertain future.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.400]   This has been reported quite a bit that their Google deal
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   is apparently--
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.480]   we don't know this for certain-- but the odds
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.080]   are from the smart people out there
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   who are talking about it.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.720]   It's up at the end of the year.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.800]   And it may not be being renewed.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.200]   Steve, you brought this to our attention.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.680]   Well, yeah, and maybe you guys have more backstory on this
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.360]   than I do because I didn't realize
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.880]   that Google was providing so much financing to Mozilla
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.840]   historically.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.960]   And that's apparently what the concern
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.520]   is that's going to end.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.840]   So what do you guys know about that?
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.160]   Well, I do know that that search bar that comes with Firefox
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:21.640]   is--
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.160]   Right.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.160]   --I don't know what the percentage of,
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.400]   but it is a predominant percentage of the money
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.000]   that Firefox makes.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.680]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.560]   Go ahead.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.000]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.080]   Oh, I was going to say, like, you know,
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.040]   E-Week 12 hours ago, Google Mozilla
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.680]   still negotiating search toolbar.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.880]   I mean, we're talking about it before the show is--
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   I don't see why maybe Bing or somebody
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.880]   wouldn't step in to finance Mozilla.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.120]   It's kind of funny, right?
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.520]   If you think of Google providing the majority of the funding
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   for Mozilla, their browser competitor with Chrome,
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.080]   I think it's--
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   I think it's a meteristic to what happens.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:56:59.680]   But--
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.400]   Well, it's kind of like Amazon putting the Kindle app on iPad.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.440]   You're sort of like, well, as long as it's popular,
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.600]   let's make some money off of it.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.840]   Yeah, well, it's like Google--
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.480]   yeah, the search deal, the E-Week articles
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.840]   is Google accounted for roughly 100 million
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.640]   if Mozilla's 123 million in sales in 2010, like 85%
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.800]   of their financing.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.160]   I mean, I get to admit, I started using Firefox again recently.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.480]   The number of updates in Firefox are driving me insane.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.160]   I think they are probably driving any corporate users
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.000]   even more insane, assuming there are any enterprise users
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.280]   left.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.880]   I think it'll be interesting to see whether Google renews it
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.160]   and if Microsoft steps in.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.920]   Right, that's the guess, right?
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.400]   Is that Bing would provide you?
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.280]   Go ahead, Ryan.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.200]   So part of my understanding in terms of how Mozilla structured
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.520]   is that-- because we know Mozilla is being a nonprofit,
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.720]   but that's only actually part of their way
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.400]   that they're structured.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.600]   Because Google represents so much of their revenue,
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.640]   they can't be a nonprofit.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.320]   I guess nonprofits have to have to legally
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.800]   be with 503C compliant--
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.940]   or that can't--
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.560]   it's 501C3 or 5013C.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.560]   Whatever it is, they have to be--
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.480]   they have to have more varied sources of income.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.920]   And since Google represents not even the majority,
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.120]   but almost basically 100% of their income,
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.720]   they can't be a nonprofit.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.120]   So they have their corporate wing,
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.880]   which then donates to the nonprofit side.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.080]   And I think that they have, in some ways, maybe more money
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.680]   than they know what to do with.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:30.720]   I don't really know what the haggling is all about.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.800]   But yeah, I mean, of course, Google-- I mean, of course,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.760]   Bing is going to buy the slot if they can get it.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.640]   It's not uncertain.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.840]   What's uncertain about this?
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.720]   Of course, they're going to buy it.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.800]   Who else has that kind of money to throw at this thing
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.320]   and is desperate for exposure to that audience?
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.080]   Of course, Bing is going to do it.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.640]   Yeah, I don't think they would blink an eye,
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.960]   although everyone assumes like, yeah,
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.160]   but they make internet explorer.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.600]   And as we mentioned, IE9 has made internet explorer
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.720]   stop declining so fast, if not bounce back a little bit.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.360]   Why would they fund the competition?
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.360]   But it's the same thing.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.520]   They want market share.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.840]   And if being the default on Firefox
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.080]   brings them more market share, they do it.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.240]   Yeah, I think they're making it.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.600]   It must be that the calculation Google is doing
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.240]   is deciding what it's worth them not to have Microsoft put
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.680]   Bing on Firefox.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.960]   Well, I mean, for Google, it's also a pretty easy thing to do.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   They can track very, very easily how much money
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.880]   they're making from Firefox.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.320]   So they can see, OK, yeah, we're turning profit on this.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.680]   Everybody wins.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.400]   There must be something else going on in terms
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.360]   of those negotiations.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.200]   But I mean, IE is-- it's a fine business for Microsoft
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:39.680]   and everything.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.360]   But I don't think that IE has the potential
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.280]   to make the money the way the Bing does.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   And I don't think that anybody at Microsoft
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:51.520]   would say IE should pose a significant threat
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.000]   to Bing being able to do a deal like that.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   Now, do you think it would be the other way
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.720]   that Mozilla is toying with switching to Bing?
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.200]   And Google is being dragged over the coals and negotiations?
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.120]   Google told E-Week, we don't disclose
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.680]   specific terms of business arrangements.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.320]   We can confirm that we still have an agreement with Mozilla.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.400]   I hope so.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.960]   I really hope that this is Mozilla actually
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.080]   pushing a harder negotiation on Google.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.280]   Because I think it's just been kind of a given for a while.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.520]   I mean, for all we know, Bing came to them six months ago
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.000]   and said, hey, when this deal is up,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.080]   we'd really love to get in for 2012 and forward.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.360]   And then Mozilla went back to Google
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.040]   and tried to get them up their annual commitment.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.560]   Now, there's another story.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.080]   I actually want to get Steve's opinion on this.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.040]   I just discovered this story just the second, Steve.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.440]   So I'm taking you a slightly bit unawares.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.320]   Did you get a chance to look at the AccuVant study
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.360]   that's going around about browser?
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:44.720]   Good.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.160]   OK, I was kind of hoping you had.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.480]   And if it hadn't been funded by Google,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.920]   I would feel it was a little more credible.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.400]   You'll see a lot of headlines saying
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.960]   Chrome is the most secure browser.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.320]   AccuVant study released Friday ranked Chrome IE and then
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:04.640]   Firefox in that order as the security of the browsers.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.880]   They said that Firefox rated four of the seven security
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.480]   features tested in Firefox, either unimplemented
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.160]   or ineffective.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.200]   But as you say, AccuVant was funded by Google.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.480]   So that cast a bit of a shadow over this.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.920]   I switched back to Firefox recently, Steve,
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.840]   for a short period of time and was enjoying it.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.800]   But the tab management, just this past week,
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   got so horrible because I have to have like 40 tabs open
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.520]   when I'm preparing for tech use today.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.080]   And it was fine at first with the new version.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.640]   But then now it's so slow.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.560]   I had to be waiting 10, 15 seconds for a tab to move
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.400]   where I wanted it to move that I went back to Chrome
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.520]   because the tab management is so good.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.720]   But you know what?
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.680]   I feel more secure in Firefox because I can run things
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.400]   like not-- or I have to run not script on Chrome,
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.440]   but I can run no script on Firefox.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.040]   That's why I wanted to get your opinion on this.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.200]   Do you think that Chrome is getting more secure?
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.920]   I actually agree with the conclusions,
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.000]   which were largely agree with the conclusions which were reached.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.760]   And I carefully read Mozilla's response to this
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.680]   where I thought that they would mount a good defense
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.920]   and that their defense was pretty weak.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.400]   They were saying, well, I mean, they sort of agreed
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.640]   with the result of this study.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.800]   And I really do believe that Chrome's underlying architecture
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.440]   is stronger than Mozilla's.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.440]   The point that's been made that I think is the best
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.800]   is that Google had the advantage that you always
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.480]   have when you're the last person to come along of looking
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.160]   at the mistakes that I made and looking
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.960]   at the mistakes that Firefox had made
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.120]   or mistakes is too strong a word.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.640]   But learning from those who went before you.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.720]   Precisely.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.520]   So being the most recently initiated browser,
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.200]   they were able to say, OK, what do we really care about in terms
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.320]   of making a strong competitor?
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.760]   And how do we want to fundamentally architect
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.160]   the browser's operation?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.280]   And so there really is a strong sandbox in Chrome
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.240]   that is missing completely from Firefox.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.960]   And it really does provide value.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:28.080]   Also, I think that they've got this complete tab isolation
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.440]   working much better in Chrome than in Firefox.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.320]   And I mean, we're a ways away from the era, which
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.000]   will all remember, where one tab could like lock up
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.280]   the entire browser.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.120]   You really don't see that that much.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.440]   But it cannot happen in Chrome.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.960]   And it's still possible, as you just
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.120]   said, like something can get kind of sticky and gunky
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.080]   in Firefox that does sort of bring the whole browser down.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.880]   Admittedly, it's 40 tabs, but still.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.640]   Yeah, folks, you know what the thing is, Google actually
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.400]   does that I really appreciate as well is they've kind of--
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.320]   I mean, I know it's slightly for publicity,
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.440]   but it actually does work.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.600]   And that is they put a bounty on security issues in Chrome.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.040]   So you surface a security issue of any kind in Chrome.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.280]   And I think it's of like different classes of severity.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.760]   They'll give you a different amount of money.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.160]   So people are collecting donny's.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.680]   I think it's like they go up to like $3,000 or $4,000,
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.680]   where if you find like a real big flaw in Chrome,
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.560]   they not only want you to get out there and show them.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.040]   Whereas most companies kind of like they're like, tell us,
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.440]   but maybe we'll do something about it.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.640]   Maybe we won't.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.960]   They want you to like tell them they're
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.480]   going to fix it quickly, and they'll pay you for it.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.200]   And I mean, there's certainly, like I said,
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.680]   there's PR value in that from having
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.840]   the perception of security.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.440]   But I actually think that it helps.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.520]   I mean, it really incentivizes people to make them help them
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.600]   become more secure.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.000]   And for what it's worth, Tom, before we leave the topic,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.280]   I have an add-on for Firefox called TreeStyleTab.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.360]   And because I'm a massive tab user.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.160]   And in fact, I'm still using Firefox
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.520]   just because the tabs are smaller on Firefox compared to Chrome.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.040]   So I can get more of them in the same space.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.000]   So it's called TreeStyleTab.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.680]   I like using the tab add-on for Firefox that you wrote.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.880]   I miss that.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.920]   I miss convergence.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.800]   I miss no script.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.320]   I miss HTTPS everywhere.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.200]   I mean, there's great add-ons in the Firefox universe.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.560]   It has a really good ecosystem, which provides it--
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.000]   well, adds a lot of value for its users.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.160]   All right.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.080]   The apartment of Homeland Security abruptly
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.680]   gave back a domain name.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.960]   This doesn't happen a lot.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.440]   Usually, it's the department of Homeland Security
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.760]   through ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.440]   seizing domain names and putting up that famous page that
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.880]   says this has been seized by ICE.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.680]   It was a criminal investigation, and the website is gone.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.240]   dejazzone.com was seized on November 26, 2010
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.960]   as part of the seizure of 81 sites.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.440]   They made a big deal about how they
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.960]   were preventing copyright infringement.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.320]   But dejazzone shared some emails with New York Times
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.360]   shortly thereafter saying, look, we had permission
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.520]   to host these tracks.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.240]   We have the emails from the record company, Aijit,
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.280]   saying, you can host this track on your website.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   ICE filed court documents, but they filed them under seal,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.680]   so nobody could see what the documents were.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.880]   And they kept extending.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.320]   They kept asking for extensions, and those were under seal.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.720]   So you couldn't find out why they were asking for extensions.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.120]   And then earlier this week, dejazzone got its domain name
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.200]   back, no explanation.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.280]   They dropped the case.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.320]   And everything still was under seal, so we still don't know.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.040]   Yeah, this is--
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.240]   it's kind of funny.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:48.360]   Two of the principal architects of SOPA and the Protect IP Act
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.480]   are now working for it.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.720]   Let me see if I can find the--
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.160]   one of them's working for the MPAA this now, two weeks later.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.080]   The other one's working for another.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.680]   Yeah, it's down on line 126 of them.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.280]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.600]   I dropped that into the doc, because this one of the things--
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.520]   Techdert was writing about this.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.720]   Basically, two of the staffers that wrote Protect IP
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.320]   and SOPA are now working with one went to the MPAA,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.440]   and one went to the--
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.480]   and an MPAA, which is music publishers and songwriters,
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.640]   where she'll be chief liaison to Capitol Hill.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.080]   The other one went to the MPAA, where she'll
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.040]   be the director of government relations.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:28.880]   So this is not exactly a new thing on Capitol Hill.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.760]   There's been cases where underlings
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.280]   have inserted single lines to the request of a company
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.880]   into a bill, like a 13,000 page finance bill,
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.200]   they inserted a line that a company was in there.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.040]   Will you become a congressional aide?
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.520]   Your biggest thing is to go work as a lobbyist for a company.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.120]   I mean, that's where the money is.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.120]   That's where the money is.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:46.800]   That's where the money is.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.200]   Yeah, that's why you're doing it.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.160]   And so this is--
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.680]   Provision 3 was accidentally blanked off the internet
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.280]   by a security company that was working that mistook us
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.080]   for a bit torrent hosting site.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.120]   Senator Wyden, one of the senators
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.880]   from Oregon is basically pointing a sharp stick at DHS
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.800]   wanting to know exactly how some of these sites ended up
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.560]   in operation in our sites.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.760]   I understand what the Department of Homeland Security is doing.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.400]   In some cases, they're taking down websites
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.040]   that are hosting profargent goods.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.480]   The last round included a number of bit torrent hosting sites
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.800]   or tracking sites.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.560]   But he's basically-- the senator is basically saying,
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.080]   administration will be receiving--
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.040]   I expect the administration will be receiving a series
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.120]   of Freedom of Information Act requests from our office
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.080]   that the senator will have very pointed questions
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.760]   with regard to how the administration chooses
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.320]   to target the sites that it does.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.720]   Because it's really sad.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.440]   This guy's website got wiped off the internet for a year.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.600]   No explanation.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.080]   No.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   It was a year?
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.840]   November 26, 2010.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.080]   Over a year.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.400]   Oh, it's crazy.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.800]   And this is the problem with Protect IP, with SOPA,
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.680]   with all these is the lack of due process.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.200]   So we're seeing that in action with this.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.520]   No, there was no due process here.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   And there's no explanation or method of remedy
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.760]   for DeJaz1 for having their domain name seized apparently
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.400]   without cause for a year.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.160]   There have been instances where the FBI has gone into data
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.400]   centers and yanked out servers that
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.200]   were hosting a site that they had permission to take off the net
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.440]   without even regard for the fact that there were another several
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.320]   hundred sites also being served by the same rack of equipment.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:38.320]   Right.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.880]   It just disappeared from the internet.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.120]   Yeah, it just happened to Instapaper a few months ago.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.880]   Oh.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.520]   And that-- and so this DHS is now being bandied about by Senator
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.680]   White and others as an example of how things go wrong when you
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.640]   assume that everyone who looks like they're acting bad is acting bad.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.280]   Well, in some cases, it may not even be that somebody's acting bad.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.240]   I mean, it's unfortunate that the--
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.520]   it's unfortunate basically that the MPAA and other organizations
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.880]   have so much power on Capitol Hill.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.440]   It's like, look, if they're scumbags, great.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.840]   Use due process, take them out.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.120]   There's a reason these checks and balances
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.400]   are put in place in the legal system.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.760]   There is an argument to be made that with the internet,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:31.320]   there are so many bad actors that it is difficult to use the old-fashioned
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.520]   brick-and-mortar process to track them all down,
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.560]   because in an infinitely replicable universe,
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.160]   there can be thousands of them.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.120]   So isn't there a way to make it more efficient?
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.200]   I think we just--
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.680]   the way to make it more efficient, in my opinion,
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.160]   is not to get rid of due process.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160]   Right.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.920]   But I get the-- I get that there's an issue here on the side of enforcing the law.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.600]   But it's basically like the whole idea that you should put control over DNS listings
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.200]   or put the ability to black hole a website by basically just peering it out of DNS
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:09.080]   in the hands of the MPAA or the RAAs profoundly foolish, profoundly short-sighted,
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.280]   and profoundly evil.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.840]   And this is an example.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.120]   Yes, guys, basically--
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:14.640]   No, sorry.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.440]   Go ahead to the track.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   Oh, no.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:22.680]   You know, it's unfortunate, like somebody basically-- maybe this guy loses living for a year,
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:28.600]   because somebody at DHS saw a couple of hip-hop tracks being hosted and got pissed off.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]   But--
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.840]   And I think to your point, Tom, in a universe where everything on the internet
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.080]   is infinitely replicatable, taking sites down is meaningless anyway.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.120]   You have to actually go after the bad actors.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.440]   They're a lot of bad actors, and they're doing bad things.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.120]   You have to go after the people who are actually doing that, taking a site offline is not really
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   going to help anyone.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.320]   You can just put up another site, not a big deal.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.200]   And I mean, this is also for like a really minor, like, in the grand scheme, if it was
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200]   copyright infringement.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.000]   I mean, is that really that big video?
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.720]   Well, that's a really good point.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.720]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.560]   Imagine, too, that you get in the situation where a site's competition turns them in as
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.280]   being a bad actor and ends up getting them pushed off the internet.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280]   Right.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:18.280]   And Ryan, you just nailed the question that no one ever deals with or doesn't deal with
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:24.760]   as often as they should in these situations, which is why is this a priority?
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:31.440]   Is copyright infringement enforcement such a priority because we're losing jobs and losing
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   money?
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.880]   You always hear that said by the industry, but where is the evidence of that?
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   The only evidence I've seen recently--
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.640]   Who's jobs and whose money?
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.280]   Is that the copyright media industries are doing okay?
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.080]   Sure, they could be making more money.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.760]   We all would like to make more money, but it doesn't seem like the industry is suffering
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.240]   horribly.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.640]   We don't see mass layoffs.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.680]   They're not saying, "We're not going to be making bad movies anymore because we just
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.680]   can't afford it."
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.040]   Yeah, I'm still yet to see any members of Metallica file for bankruptcy.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.480]   It doesn't seem like they're-- I'm trying to try not to be glib here, but it doesn't
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.800]   seem like there is evidence that this should be prioritized above things like terrorism,
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.360]   like malware.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.720]   We are not going after people who create viruses and botnets with the same level of
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.640]   ferocity that were going after people who share copyright material.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:31.040]   I will actually-- as much as I want to bag on misguided federal efforts, they actually
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.120]   did recently take out a pretty huge botnet.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.320]   They did, but are we strengthening the laws?
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.960]   Are we just using existing laws?
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.640]   And if that's the case, if the laws are good enough to catch botnets, why aren't they good
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.080]   enough to catch copyright infringers?
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.560]   Well, because apparently people fighting botnets, the idea-- yeah, I am not even going
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560]   to--
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.960]   It's just-- it's such a pain to go through all that due process.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:52.960]   I think it really is.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   That's what it comes down to.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.960]   It is.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.920]   It's a mark on their bottom line.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.800]   If we could just push a button and have that site disappear, that's so much easier.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.960]   Let's just give us that button.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   Exactly.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.960]   It's really easy.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.040]   We don't want to have to convince a judge.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.040]   That's so annoying.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040]   This is a period in time-- I'm thoroughly convinced.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:18.320]   This is a period in time in 20 years that people are going to look back and either laugh
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.120]   or shake their heads wondering, how was that ever the way things operated when the internet
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.120]   works like this?
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.800]   And these are the sensible laws that we have since figured out.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.920]   But we're in that period where we're in a transition of technology and everyone's trying
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.720]   to force their old business models and their old values and their old laws onto the new
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.720]   template.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.720]   I think it's so sweet that your vision of the future isn't like, gosh, there used to
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.240]   be a time when you didn't have to register your website with AT&T and the RIAA.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.160]   No, because you know what?
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.560]   That's not usually the way it goes.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.280]   Even if it goes that way for a short period of time, history has shown us that the consumer
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.160]   generally wins, even if it takes a while.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.480]   Maybe 20 years is too optimistic.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.320]   Let's-- it does take a quick break at that.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   That's why I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   I'm not going to be a part of the world.

[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.320]   and we thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.320]   All right.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.320]   We got a few other things to finish up here before we get out.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.320]   I wanted to talk about Spotify's new app.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.320]   Well, it's a new app platform that they announced at the beginning of last week.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.320]   I think we talked about it a little bit last week,
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.320]   but Spotify announced a third-party app store and an open platform.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   It was less than what a lot of people thought.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.320]   A lot of people thought they were going to give that an API,
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   and anybody could include Spotify in their apps.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.320]   Instead, you build an app in Spotify.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.320]   So, last FM can be integrated in the client.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.320]   It's a way to keep people happy within Spotify.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.320]   They also announced at the end of the week Spotify Radio,
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   which is a Pandora-like feature,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.320]   which allows you to just drag a track from your Spotify
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.320]   list over to the radio, and it'll start a radio station
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.320]   and has an algorithm that will decide what other songs you might like
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320]   based on that one track.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320]   Anybody use Spotify?
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   Do you use Spotify?
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320]   I'm more of an audio guy personally.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320]   Nobody uses Spotify in this panel?
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320]   No.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.320]   Is this going to change anybody's mind?
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   I actually kind of might.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   I'm willing to use the other try.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   I had Spotify access really early.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.320]   When it was still European only,
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.320]   I managed to get an account from the Spotify people.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320]   I thought it was impressive.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:55.320]   It felt too heavy, but iTunes, you know,
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320]   iTunes you really like it or you really don't.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.320]   For me, iTunes is just so heavy.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.320]   Spotify really feels really heavy.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.320]   I like the audio.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320]   It just feels really light and simple and easy
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.320]   and sharing is very nice.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   Maybe I'll give it another go.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.320]   Twitter also announced a major redesign.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320]   You've probably seen it by now.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320]   It's rolled out to most everybody.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:17.320]   It affects their mobile apps as well as their website.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   So when you go to Twitter now, everything is simple.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   It's in line.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.320]   They brought a bunch of press into their new office space
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320]   that is being built and made a big metaphor
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   about rebuilding and simplification and all of this
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   and how 140 characters is all you need.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320]   But I like most of this stuff.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320]   They simplify the navigation.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   So on the website, you get home, connect, and discover.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]   The home is pretty obvious.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320]   It's the home site.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   That's where you get your feed.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.320]   The connect has got an ad symbol by it.
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.320]   And that shows you all the people who are interacting with you.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.320]   So people who followed you, any ad replies,
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   you can simplify it down to being just the mentions
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   if you just want to see the ad replies.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.320]   And then discover sort of their search situation,
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.320]   although they raise a bunch of stuff that's trending in there
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.320]   when you go there.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.320]   And then you can enter a hashtag or keyword.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   And it's got the hashtag symbol up at the top.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   Now on the mobile side, they also have one that's
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   called me, I think, which takes you to your profile.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   On the website, they just have the little silhouette for you to go to.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.320]   But the big thing is, when you're looking at somebody's posts
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   on your timeline, now instead of stuff going over in the sidebar,
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.320]   like pictures and videos, it all takes place right there below.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   So you get to see that embedded map or that video right in line
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320]   with what you're looking at.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.320]   I'm trying to find a good example here.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.320]   Clayton Morris flying to San Francisco and drinking a beer.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   And there's the beer he's drinking right there in line.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   Isn't that gorgeous?
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   What do you guys think?
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]   Excited or don't care.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   Let's move on.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.320]   I just logged in and it looks the same to me as--
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   You still get the old one?
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320]   Well, maybe it hasn't rolled out as far as I thought.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   I think if you update the iOS client or maybe get the new tweet deck
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   or if you do any of the clients, I think that's,
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.320]   they gave priority rollout.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.320]   I'm not on the web yet.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   Well, it is on the web.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   I have access to the new website because I updated my iOS client.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   Right.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   What he's saying is when you update the app on the mobile site,
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.320]   it will push you into having the new version on the web.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   Oh, interesting.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.320]   Okay.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   Cool.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.320]   That worked for me.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.320]   That's how I got it earlier this week.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320]   I--
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   I mean, there's some stuff in there that I actually think is really clever.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.320]   Like the tweet box on basically everybody's page in the upper left.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   And there's some nice tweaks.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.320]   I think this whole thing is basically a mess, especially the iOS client.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.320]   It's just really not good.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.320]   They did some stuff in there that just really rankles me.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   I--
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.320]   I--
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.320]   I--
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   I'm kind of right there with you.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   I mean, there's not anything overall that I think was awful.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.320]   But then there's a couple of things in particular that I just hate.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.320]   The fact that when I go to connect, I now have to click on mentions
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   because I don't really want to see all of these other interactions.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   I just want to see the @ replies.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.320]   And it never-- I can't change it to default to that.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   At least I don't think so.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.320]   And I don't have the ability to tweet from that page without clicking.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.320]   There's no box at the top.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.320]   I have to go and click.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.320]   Now, these aren't killers for me, but they're--
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320]   there's things that I don't really love.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.320]   And there's nothing else that I-- that they did that I'm like, "Wow, this is revolutionary."
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.320]   Like, having stuff in line is nice.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.320]   I mean, you know, part of me wants to say that, like, maybe I don't like it
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.320]   because it's just different and it's not what we're used to.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   I mean, for so long, we've thought of mentions as being mentioned,
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   not as being connect.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.320]   And then they changed it.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   And, you know, the idea is that it's easier for people to understand.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.320]   And maybe I just find it harder to understand because I'm so used to it being a certain way.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]   And maybe that's part of what it is.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.320]   But I actually just don't really see the necessity for those kinds of changes.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.320]   If the problem is that users don't understand Twitter,
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.320]   I think that changing what's already there and making it even more obscure
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.320]   is really not the way to solve that.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.320]   I think educating your users and making sure they understand how to use this app
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   is the correct approach.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   And at least in your example, Ryan, I think mention is a much better verb for what--
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   Yeah, and connect is meaningless.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.320]   It doesn't mean anything to me.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.320]   Well, they're trying to put in all these other things like so-and-so followed you,
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.320]   so-and-so favorited you.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.320]   And I don't know how important that is to me.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   Yeah, and also connect implies a stickiness like something is going to stay connected
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.320]   when I mention is exactly what it is.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:45.320]   Okay, anybody excited about 128 gigabit 20 nanometer NAND flash?
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320]   Whoo!
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.320]   How about if I tell you it can pack two terabytes into a two and a half inch solid state drive?
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   Now is that something that might interest you?
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   What's the next aeration iPod I've been waiting for all my music in the car at all times?
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320]   Bring it.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.320]   All your music in your belly button.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   Yeah, I'm talking about it.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320]   Mass production is set to start the first half of next year,
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:08.320]   and device is using the dyes likely to start shipping in 2013.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.320]   For what it's worth, there are several other non-volatile technologies
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   which are really about to break.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:21.320]   Also, HP has this Memristor technology, which solves a lot of problems that NAND flash in general
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.320]   that the whole endurance problem that flash has.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   And there's also something called phase change, which is coming along surprisingly quickly also.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   So I think we're going to see a bunch of non-volatile stuff happening,
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320]   and that's all good.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   When is the magnetic hard drive done?
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   Yeah, that's my concern.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   A long time from now.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   A long time.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320]   I got plenty of time.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.320]   Yes.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.320]   There's a very easy way to know when it's done.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   When a non-magnetic hard drive has the same capacity for the same amount of money or less, then it's done.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   Boom.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   That's it.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.320]   Okay, if we get that.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.320]   Every year we get closer.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.320]   I've been actually really stoked about where we are.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.320]   I mean, I've been looking forward to SSD since the mid to late '90s.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.320]   I've been wanting one.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:08.320]   I've always thought that magnetic hard drives seem so ridiculous and primitive.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   Especially in portable devices.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.320]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.320]   Yeah, adjacent to processors with billions of transistors.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320]   It just makes no sense.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   Why would we be using these ridiculous spinning disks?
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.320]   Well, it's also getting closer.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   It's really a group Goldberg when you take a step back from it.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:34.320]   It's like, "So you're storing my music in magnetic zeros and ones on a disc that's rotating at 60,000 RPM with a magnet flying head that will float above it."
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   But when you start looking at all the devices in there, it's amazing that hard drives actually work.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.320]   Yeah, and all those ridiculous things we have to do to make it plausible.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   If the G4 sensor goes off the arm, swing back into position so it doesn't scratch it.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   All these things that we've had to engineer around to make this ridiculous system work.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   Come on, there's clearly an easier way to solve state memory.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.320]   Well, clearly there's an easier way to solve state memory.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:14.320]   And right now, there's somebody twitching who's been doing process production at Intel or a memory company going,
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:20.320]   "Oh, yeah, it's easy. Just reduced the size of the chip. Oh, yeah, it's easy."
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.320]   Like, it took us 10 years to get to this point.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:30.320]   Well, I mean, Captain Kirk had those little cubes all that time ago, and we're finally beginning to get those.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.320]   Yes, who jetpacks? I just want more memory in my iPhone.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   I'll put my jetpack off for another 10 years if I can get cheap 2TB solid-state drives in all my devices.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320]   I agree with you.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   All right, while we were talking there, I put it to the chat room.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:52.320]   We want to have more Apple television rumors, the new Verizon Video Service, or crazy stuff Eric Schmidt said,
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   as our last story, and Eric Schmidt seems to have won the day.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.320]   It was close with the Apple TV rumors.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   So the Verizon Video Service, just for those who might slightly be curious,
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   Verizon says they're going to put out their own video service, all on Netflix,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   in a limited way, in areas where they don't do Verizon files.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.320]   You can find out more about that elsewhere.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:17.320]   You already know what the Apple TV rumors are, because they're the same crazy ones everyone's been saying for a long time.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.320]   But Eric Schmidt at LaWeb was speaking and said,
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:28.320]   "Most TVs will have Google TV by mid-2012."
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320]   Now, I'm not a hundred.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.320]   He said, "Here's the smoking what?"
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.320]   He said, "By the summer of 2012, the majority of the televisions you see in stores will have Google TV embedded in it."
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.320]   So I'm not paraphrasing to make him sound any crazier than he already does.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.320]   My guess is that he didn't realize it's 2011.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320]   Maybe he thinks 2012.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.320]   That's a long way in the future.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:55.320]   It says, you know, maybe he personally paid to have the code for Google TV inserted into like every Samsung.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.320]   He's going to go with the phone.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320]   Which camera is it?
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.320]   Or maybe there was a transposition and it meant 2021.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320]   Maybe that's it.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.320]   Because, I mean, you know, it would have to already be underway.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:10.320]   I mean, those machines, those sets will have to be production somewhere.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320]   Maybe it's already--
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.320]   I'm so sorry.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:18.320]   He knows something that we don't, and that there's going to be this major push, and we're all going to be like, "What?"
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.320]   I mean, I know it sounds crazy, and I think that it probably is crazy.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   But the reality is TV manufacturers have a very hard time differentiating and selling sets right now because TVs are just so ridiculously commoditized.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.320]   That's why everyone jumped on that 3D bandwagon.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   Which I won't even get into that, but, you know, because they had nothing else.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   They had nothing else to get people excited about their TV.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.320]   So everyone's kind of looking for the next thing that they can get people excited about with the television.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.320]   Google TV 1.0, obviously, not that.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   But if there's something they can do, I think they're going to try to pursue it.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   I updated our Logitech review to the new Google TV this morning.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.320]   It is light years better than the old interface.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.320]   It was a little buggy at first.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.320]   It didn't pick up on our account right away, and it couldn't let us install apps.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.320]   But once we got past that, you're able to install apps.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.320]   The interface is not perfect, but it's much cleaner.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:18.320]   The video passed through, which I had had problems with direct TV video going through the Google TV and looking jaggy.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320]   That is much better.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:24.320]   It still looks like it's getting a little dark when it goes through for some reason, but that I can adjust for.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   And that's fine.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   And they have a new app that you basically say, "I want to watch this."
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:37.320]   And it tells you whether you have it available on television, how much time is left in that show, if it's airing right now,
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:44.320]   or if it's available on Netflix or Amazon or any of the other sources that you have installed on the machine.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.320]   I think they've made a huge improvement.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.320]   Wow.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.320]   Unfortunately, that box is no longer being made.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:54.320]   No, but this is the software that would run on all of these TVs in the stores in 2012.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320]   Google TV--
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.320]   You just can't really get it up any--
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.320]   Well, you can.
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.320]   They still have a relationship with Sony.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.320]   LG has said that they will be releasing Google TVs at CES 2012.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   It's interesting.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   I think it'll be really interesting to see, because Samsung has made huge efforts to differentiate the software platform
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.320]   or the software platform available on their TVs.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.320]   Vizio has worked-- they've integrated a lot of stuff on there.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:25.320]   Vizio is like half television sold in the United States, or was close to it at least last year or before.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:33.320]   And so Google could-- if Vizio secretly has adopted Google TV and they've managed to not leak anything about it,
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:41.320]   and that's between Vizio and LG, then more than 50% of the television available could potentially be running
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.320]   Google TV.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.320]   But the reality is the software packages vary so much across the different levels.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.320]   I find it difficult to believe 2012.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   2020, sure.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.320]   2015, maybe 2012.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   That means the entire ACTV industry or the majority of the ACTV sales-- the companies that control the majority of the ACTV sales
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   in the United States managed to keep their mouths shut, keep their engineers' mouths shut, and keep the suppliers' mouths shut
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320]   about the fact that they're--
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   And keep all those Google TV press releases from mentioning it.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.320]   All-- you know what I mean?
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.320]   That would be really impressive.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.320]   If nobody in CD--
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.320]   Oops, sorry.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.320]   I was going to say, Tom, you get-- put-- mark it on the calendar.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.320]   You were Leo, or both of you revisit this.
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.320]   June 30th.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.320]   We'll see what happens.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320]   You know, it's funny.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320]   Actually, I did that.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320]   We'll see who was right.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.320]   I put it in my calendar.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   I keep a calendar of events for Tech News today, and I said, "You know what?
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   I'm putting this in."
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.320]   And June, check store shelves for Google TV.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320]   We'll see.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320]   Right.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.320]   Then Eric Schmidt will be laughing, because we'll be like, "My God, he was right.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.320]   They're all running Google TV.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320]   How did it happen?"
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.320]   All right, that's it for this episode of This Week in Tech.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.320]   Thank you guys so much for joining me.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.320]   This has been an absolute pleasure.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.320]   Don't forget, folks.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.320]   We're looking for the best moments of Twit for our holiday end of year special.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   There's going to be a holiday special with John Hodgman and Jonathan Colton come, and
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.320]   don't worry about that.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.320]   There's also a best of where we just edit together all the best moments from the year.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:15.320]   So if you have one that you want to make sure is included, if you can get the episode number
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.320]   and time come, that'd be great.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   But even if you just remember what it was about, go to twit.tv/bestof and submit those
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   moments there.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:26.320]   You can submit them for all the shows on Twit, but definitely do it for This Week in Tech.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.320]   Patrick Norton, always good.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.320]   Thanks for making the trek up here.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.320]   Thanks for not hurting me.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   I'm out of Texas, like I could.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.320]   I'm out of Texas, when they can watch it, where they can watch it, all they can.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:41.320]   Tomorrow after you don't have the joy of recording with an episode of TechSill, with Veronica Belmont
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:46.320]   back from her Costa Rica holidays, I have to remind Ryan, don't be late to pick her up.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320]   I won't be, don't worry.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320]   It's under control.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.320]   It's blowing up on Twitter right now.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.320]   We're solid.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.320]   So, yeah, Tuesdays and Thursdays at TechSill.com, come check it out.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   Excellent.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:58.320]   And Toys Me Him.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.320]   I'll go to you next to make sure that you can get up in a different time.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.320]   But, yeah, let folks know about Gadget.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320]   What's going on over there?
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.320]   Gadget@gdt.com.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   We have a holiday guide up, actually, right now.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   So, go check out.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   We've got lots of cool pics.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320]   Excellent.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.320]   Excellent stuff.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.320]   Love Gadget.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.320]   I keep my list there as well.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   And Steve Gibson, of course, security now every Wednesday on the Twit network, as well as all
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   the amazing stuff you do over there at grc.com, like, shields up, spin right, and the haystacks
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.320]   project is another one of my favorites.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.320]   Yeah, we got picked up by Consumer Reports that did a nice story on the password haystacks
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   page and concept.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.320]   So, that was very cool.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.320]   Congratulations on that.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.320]   Anything else to add before we take off?
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320]   I think not.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:45.320]   But we're going to do a special Christmas show on science fiction.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.320]   It was an idea that I floated with Leo a couple of weeks ago and I've just been, I've gotten
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:53.320]   a ton of feedback from our listeners of security now who said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   Do a sci-fi show."
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:58.320]   So, we won't be repeating the portable dog killer episode again.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.320]   Instead, we're going to do a sci-fi show.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.560]   So, I think it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.320]   I am looking forward to that, actually.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.320]   I'm going to mine that for ideas for Sword and Laser.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   Cool.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.320]   All right, folks.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   Thanks, everybody, for listening or watching.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.320]   Leo, the port will be back in the chair next week.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   Don't worry.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.320]   You can find us at twit.tv if you're wondering, "What is this show?
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.320]   How did I find it?
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.320]   Where can I find others like it?"
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   That's where you go.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.320]   In the can goes another Twit.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   We'll see you next time.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   This is amazing.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:34.320]   [music]
