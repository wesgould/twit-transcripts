[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.080]   And this time we had to bring in somebody on the Windows side and on the Mac side. And
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.600]   then Mike Elgin, you're in the middle. Mike Elgin is here from Elgin.com. He represents
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.320]   the DMZ, the neutral zone. That's great to have you in studio back from Morocco.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.720]   Yeah, just got back from Morocco after two months in Morocco. Watching all your pictures,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.200]   of course, Mike and his wife, Amir, do the Gastronomad Adventures in Morocco was your
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   most recent. So we'll find out about that a bit. I see you've also brought a beverage.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.040]   I have. We will find out about that a bit. But let's introduce the guys who can't drink
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.960]   with us. Near left representing the Macintosh contingent. Doc Rock, youtube.com/docrock.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.720]   Hi, Doc. Thank you. Thank you. I am very Mac heavy, but I am actually bisexual, have
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.920]   been bisexual since the very beginning of time because I have a CNC in the laser machine.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.240]   Oh, you have to be bisexual. Yes. But I am probably about 90% Mac sites. I pretend that
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:46.680]   I use Windows. You're bisexual. Okay. I. It's not my favorite thing in the world. Daniel
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.760]   Rubino used it. No, no, no, no, no. It's joyfully doesn't he from Windows Central, his executive
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.880]   editor over there. Or see, I'm starting to think Paul Therat is using Windows because
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.720]   it's his career, not because he had a choice. You know what I'm saying? Yes. I think that's
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.640]   it does kind of feel accurate as well. I don't know. It's hard when I choose.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   Well, these days Microsoft seems to be kind of actively annoying. It's users. I'm sure
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.080]   that's not how they see it. I think that's the even the less than 1% users who are complaining.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.000]   I think most people are actually pretty fine. It's a Windows 11 has actually been very successful
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.760]   for Microsoft. It's good. Absolutely. It looks good. We better look at it now. So that's
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.720]   on it. Yes. Good. Look, it's a good looking. Although I had somebody call me on the radio
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.040]   show yesterday, said I cannot install Chrome no matter what I do. I just got the surface
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.560]   book go and it won't let me install Chrome. And I said, you wouldn't buy any chance to
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   be using Windows S 10s. He said, Oh, yeah. Right. Said, Oh, well, let me let me walk
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.160]   you through it. Break it to you. Let me break it to you. No, you can't. But that's it.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.480]   But then I'd explain. Well, it's easy to turn off because actually you have a full Windows
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.240]   10 machine. It's just a setting. Where do I go to set it? Well, you would think the
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.840]   control panel, but no, you go to the Windows Store and you push a button that implies you're
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.320]   going to buy and upgrade to Windows called Windows 10 Pro. You press the get button and
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.600]   suddenly now you're normal again. It's very confusing. That is not a good thing.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.480]   I didn't find it confusing. I thought they made it so much simpler recently because it
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.960]   gives you the pop up menu is you just follow, you know, I already clicked that and it goes
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.120]   to the store and you're like, can you click something else? Like it's less than 60 seconds.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.440]   But you're not sure why we boot anymore. You understand? Yeah, I know it's because it's
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.280]   really I think it's just probably a waste. It's relatively confusing in the Windows
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.240]   context. They're far more confusing. Right. This was always a problem with me with podcasting
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.240]   was you would have to go to a store and press a button that said subscribe. And I think
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.400]   that probably slowed down podcasting because people thought, well, what is this going
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.880]   to cost me? Right. And so I think going to a store to do a free upgrade is a little
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.320]   problematic. But anyway, look, believe me, there's problems on all sides, all sides.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:12.200]   We have awful people on both sides. But there is none awfuler than Mr. Elon Musk, the new
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.760]   owner of Twitter. Well, at least he owns the lion's share of Twitter more even than the
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:26.800]   Jack or Biz or Ev. He's got more than 9% of Twitter. Kind of interesting. Elon's been
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.960]   slowly buying it up since January. Since January 31st. Yeah. And he he's going to be
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.360]   on the board. And this is the thing that I think is underemphasized in his essential
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.880]   takeover of Twitter, which is that there's a lot of mousy sort of like nondescript people
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.680]   on the board. And then you have this bigger than life personality Elon Musk. And he's
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.600]   just going to be running rough shot over over the board. He's he's gonna. And this
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.920]   is my biggest fear, actually, that he's going to use it as this personal plaything. He's
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   going to mess around with features. He's going to use it to troll the SEC. He's going to do
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.600]   all these things that are for him personally. I don't know that he's going to do that. There's
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.400]   no evidence, but I just feel like why else would he want to be so involved in Twitter,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.680]   suddenly as a con the information even said, Oh, just go ahead and do it. You know, you're
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.200]   going to make him the CEO. Well, it's not. That giveaway was him saying, Oh, I'm going
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.760]   to bring out the edit button and Twitter have to go second later talking about this for
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.480]   years. Relax people. And we're going to do it. And yeah, they were kind of, I think,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.000]   I grow all the CEO, the interim CEO of Twitter. I think was at pains to say, Oh, no, no,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.480]   this wasn't because of Elon, but it was right after Elon's right pole. He's not stopping
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.120]   there. Look at Elon's Twitter. It goes on and on and on. Here's the most recent. This
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.800]   is from Elon the fourth grader. Should we delete the W in Twitter? And there's only
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:14.240]   two choices. Yes, or of course, by the way, yes is winning. That's obviously jokey, but
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.080]   then you have to wonders, you know, how much is of this is jokey convert Twitter's SF headquarters
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.440]   to homeless shelters since no one shows up anyway. Now, if you're on the Twitter team,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.120]   if you're an employee, you might, I mean, I might say that's a joke. You might say,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.560]   Oh, right. Well, he does, he does extreme things. I mean, he really does them with his
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.440]   other company. I don't think he's going to turn into a homeless shelter. No, but it could
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.680]   be a shot at people who aren't working from home. Right. But again,
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.920]   Yeah, I think that's what it was. Yeah. It's the whole idea that he's kind of set that
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.480]   people aren't showing up, you know, for their work from home because a lot of companies
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   are obviously refining their policies now. I find like the problem with him is like,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.440]   there's no repercussions for his actions. And that's what happens when you're very wealthy.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.280]   You have a lot of power. A lot of people on Twitter, you know, follow him and respond
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.800]   to him and want to be part of his orbit. And when you're that powerful and you don't
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.440]   have repercussions, you can just go and act the way you want to act. And no one's going
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.680]   to kind of stop you. And that's, you know, the tweet about, you know, is Twitter dying,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.600]   he says, because he, he cited like the top three people who are followed on Twitter and
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   how little they tweet. Right. And like anyone who knows anything about social networks
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.320]   realizes like, that's not how you analyze a social network in terms of growth, which
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.200]   is monthly active users and monthly active growth and new subscribers. How Twitter blue
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.160]   is doing, you know, all this like, all these other metrics that he could be using. And instead,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.920]   he comes from this other angle. And it's just so like, this is going to be the person
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.720]   in, you know, caught not in charge, but you know, trying to run this show here. It's just
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   kind of disturbing.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:49.680]   Let's be clear. Elon Musk is a Twitter troll and all this stuff about him joining the board
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.000]   and buying, you know, the money he spent to buy up 3 billion 9.2% of the company is nothing
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.360]   to him. I mean, it's less what is it 1% about 1% of his total wealth. It's really nothing.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:09.240]   And it it amplifies greatly amplifies an already amplified Twitter account. By the way, the
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.360]   stock price went up 27% when he was announced that he had purchased this amount and he could
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.040]   have just sold it and made a billion dollars. Right. But I mean, as Dan was saying that
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.640]   there's all these, all these metrics that you normally use to, to judge the impact of a
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.600]   social network. But the one that especially applies to Twitter is the fact that all the
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.640]   media is on it. Celebrities are on it. Justin Bieber notwithstanding, who's only. Well,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   here's, here's the tweet. Top 10 most valid Twitter accounts. Most of these top accounts
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.000]   tweet rarely post very little content is Twitter dying. Barack Obama. Well, he's not president
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.200]   anymore. Justin Bieber. I don't know. Katy Perry, Rihanna, Cristiano Taylor Swift, Lady
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:58.320]   Gaga, Elon Musk is number eight. He's tweeting to make up for the top seven. Narendra Modi,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.560]   the primary premier of India and the Ellen show. But he says, for example, Taylor Swift
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.000]   hasn't posted anything in three months. And Justin Bieber only posted once this entire
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.920]   year. But is that a problem? I don't know. The problem is that all these other people
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.160]   who don't tweet have more followers than he does. And that's the problem. Oh, there are
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.840]   also just, I mean, they're in their PR accounts, right? These are accounts that are run by
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.320]   PR agencies. Well, Taylor Swift's actually on Twitter. I'm maybe she is. I might say
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.240]   there is a problem because anybody smart like Taylor Swift who has to manage her reputation
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:40.200]   carefully is probably reluctant to tweet. Nothing good ever came out of a tweet. Yeah.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.720]   Lots of poster boy for that. So maybe what he's saying Twitter is dying in the sense
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.640]   that people are reluctant to use it because of trolls, mischief, all sorts of stuff that
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.960]   can happen when you tweet, you know, that's that's a very positive outlook. I would love
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.120]   that to be the case. You know, the funny thing about Twitter is everybody uses Twitter.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.560]   A lot of us use it for our job. Mike was accurate, right? It's a lot of news and media journalists.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.080]   We have to use it. But then everybody seems to also hate Twitter. And so it's this weird
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.400]   thing. Everybody hates it. Half the people want an edit button. And now they're finally
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.440]   getting an edit button. A lot of people are like upset. They're just going to be an edit
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.800]   button. A lot of news people are upset about it. And it's one of those things like no one's
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.080]   really happy with Twitter. I'm not sure how to solve anything on there, you know, with
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.800]   the harassment. Like if you want to address harassment, you have to talk about what a
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.360]   lot of people call censorship, but I would just call rules of the platform and, you know,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.120]   terms of service. So those two things collide. So I don't know, Elon Musk, you know, if he
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.880]   wants to control, you know, trolling and everything that you have to put regulations basically
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.680]   on the platform more term for in the terms of service. And that's something he seems
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.280]   very adamant against. So I don't know how this is ever going to get better, to be honest.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.480]   I fear that he will unleash the trolls out of a sense of, you know, free speech or whatever.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.880]   That's how this all started was. Is there such a thing as free speech on Twitter?
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.960]   Maybe we should start our own social network. And then it was revealed after he tweeted that,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   he had already bought. Now, by the way, this is not a controlling interest, but no one has
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.440]   a controlling interest. It is the largest single shareholder by a long shot. Right. Jack Dorsey
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.840]   only has 2.2%. So he, you know, I don't know how it works in corporate governance these days, but
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:34.800]   having 9% of a company is a significant thing. It also depends also on the shares, right?
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.520]   Because there's different levels of shares. I know Google does this where there's like a top level
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.400]   share. And it's the share that like the founders hold. And one of those is worth more than a third
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.960]   level share because due to voting rights, which I think the third level doesn't even have voting
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   rights. And so I know corporations can stagnate there or not stagnate, but stack their shares in a
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.800]   certain way that some are worth more than others. I'm not sure if that applies to Twitter. So,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.680]   it's problematic in two directions. In one direction, Elon Musk is essentially Twitter, by the way,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.640]   as far as I know, has one class of stock. It's all the same common stock voting shares.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.840]   But if he's on the board and he owns 9.2% of the company, then he can have an undue influence
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.280]   on his own Twitter account and even worse, his own Twitter account can have an undue influence
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.600]   on the company. So, for example, if he loses a vote on the board, he can just go crap all over
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.920]   the board, crap all over Twitter, affect their stock price, do the stuff that he in fact has done
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.440]   with Tesla stuff. He could do that without 9.2% of the stock. That's true. That's true. But
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.560]   he may use his influence as megaphone to be overly influential on the board to do to ram
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.760]   through features of the company. And he is how to use it for PR. I mean, that's the thing.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.400]   He's going to use it to cover issues with the cyber truck. He can easily silence tweets about
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   solar city messing up. I mean, Lord knows that battle was kind of messy and still not completely
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.600]   straight. People in California that went early on solar city are still waiting for stuff. I mean,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:12.560]   and we understand supply crisis, whatever. But having a platform this strong, he can control the
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.160]   narrative of things like that. That's the part that's crazy. And that also makes it big.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:25.280]   We should. I mean, SEC did put strictures on Elon Musk, which he promptly ignored, one of which is
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.600]   that every tweet would have to be reviewed by an ombudsman before he tweets and he completely
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:41.360]   ignored it. SEC was mad because, well, the one where he said, I have enough, what do you say? I'm
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.880]   going to buy back. Take I'm going to take Tesla private, right, at four to twenty dollars a share.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.320]   That was in finance. He's already got the financing for this, which is a lie. Right.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.760]   And then the stock promptly went up. And so he made money on it. In fact, this whole Twitter
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:04.720]   thing, according to the Washington Post, may have made him $156 million because he delay, he
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   broke again broke the SEC rules about about disclosure. He was 11 days late in disclosing
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.760]   that he surpassed a 5% stake in the company. And by doing so, could have benefited it with the stock
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.200]   rise. In other words, bought it before anybody knew that he was a controlling owner. Yeah.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.960]   And then the stock goes up and he sells it. That's illegal, of course. But why would he care when
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.840]   in August of 2018, when he tweeted that and went through the whole thing, the SEC
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:44.000]   fined him 20 million and fined Tesla another 20 million. 20 million to Elon Musk is like
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.280]   25 cents to you and me. Around the era. Yeah. Or to me. And that's why it's so bad when they
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.840]   give him these, which sounds like a lot to the public. So that way it looks like you did something.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   Right. You're not really winning. You had a you and me 20 million. Like real, but not to him. Yeah.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.640]   Yeah. Even if you get a job, right, is be is commensurate to your, you know, your experience
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.280]   or whatever. Right. So like make the punishments commensurate to your wealth. Like that was his
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:16.480]   dunk. Yep. So here's so here's the question for you guys. Do we give him a pass because of what he
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:24.960]   has done, which is remarkable with Tesla and SpaceX? I mean, he has single handedly put EVs on the map
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.600]   and now that the earth is burning and it's it. We're very glad he did, right? SpaceX just put
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:38.240]   four non astronauts on the International Space Station. He's Starlink is going to provide internet
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.720]   access to the whole world. Maybe not quite as well as was suggested, but still also contributing to
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.120]   global cooling because it's shadowing the earth and satellites, but that's okay. We'll take it.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:58.400]   Raising the earth's albedo. So do we give him a pass, Mike? Well, I don't like the fact that he's
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.480]   on the board and owning 9.2% stake, but it's his legal right. And so it's really not about giving
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:13.440]   a pass, not a legal pass. If he if the SEC doesn't have fines that actually curb law breaking and
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:20.400]   bad behavior, then they then that's our our problem is, as by the way, less citizens. Last month,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.320]   must cast the SEC to scrap the agreement. Right. Yeah. The agreement he wasn't really adhering to
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.480]   because it has not clearly been vetting his tweets with lawyers. I do not respect the SEC.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.000]   He said plainly on 60 minutes a few years ago. He it's and this is clearly the case. And but I
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.320]   just, you know, again, I don't like it. Some people do like it. Some people love the fact that, you know,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:49.600]   some loose cannon is on the Twitter board, etc. But I think it's I think it's legal. So
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.800]   is the best way to do pumping dump, which he has done again and again in February.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.440]   It was announced the SEC was investing a stock sale by his brother. Remember the tweet he put out
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.280]   November saying, Hey, should I sell a 10% stake in Tesla to help the poor or to pay taxes or end
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:14.800]   world hunger? And the day before that tweet, his brother sold a bunch of stock. So he I mean,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.880]   he did it with Dogecoin. He's done it with other cryptocurrencies. He the Twitter for him is a
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.200]   fantastic vehicle to make money. The irony is I don't think he does because I don't think he
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.520]   cares about it. He's got plenty. He's the richest man in the world. This is crazy. Do you give him a
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.600]   past annual because of the the great things he's done? I mean, he definitely has done great things
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.080]   when it comes to science and engineering is known to add about it. Evidence is lacking for his
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.120]   ability to make social networks better. Now, in terms of giving him a past, no, but I am a
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.000]   weight and see kind of person. So I'll give him a fair shot. I mean, like, I have a choice here
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.280]   anyway, right? We're all just kind of waiting and seeing what happens with Twitter. It could get
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.720]   better. It could get worse. I don't know even how you measure if it's getting better or worse either
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:09.200]   since so many people, you know, have conflicting views on it. I think the bigger issue is I just
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.520]   find it just bizarre that people talk about, you know, the issue of centralizations of the internet,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.800]   right? Everything. And this is something that a former CEO of Twitter was talking about.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.320]   You know, this idea that everything is centralized and controlled by corporations. And
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.160]   here we have a billionaire who just kind of does whatever he wants and buys up things and doesn't
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.840]   matter if it's good or bad. And then people keep looking up to these people as if they're going to
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   save society. And I'm not sure that's the appropriate way we should be running things. I rather have
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.440]   a more grassroots actual people involved because fundamentally, it's anti-democratic. When you just
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.680]   have one person with so much wealth and capital and influence determining the direction of something
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:59.040]   as, you know, as important as Twitter is in terms of news these days. And who knows what comes next?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.000]   And I think this is just a, but people love it. They want it. They want to say they're for democracy,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.960]   they're for more equality. But then when it comes to worshiping a billionaire, you know, they get
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.160]   wrapped up in this idea that he really is like Iron Man when he's not. He's just another flawed
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.560]   human being who's made some amazing decisions and done some great things. But the end of the day
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.840]   is still just a person who maybe he's not the right person for every single job on the planet.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:32.000]   Doc Rock, do we give Elon a pass? No, hard no. I'm with Daniel to some extent on the wait and
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:41.520]   see part of it. But I think the concept of, okay, let me fix this. Americans in general,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.920]   probably more global population than just us, but I can speak to the people that I see.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.800]   We really have to stop looking at other people to be heroes. When people ask me who is the most
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.160]   inspirational person to you, I give them the answer that most people hate. I go me. Why?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.480]   Because I started worrying about stuff that I can control. I'm not looking to anyone else to
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.200]   make the world better. I'm going to try myself. And man, I don't know how good I'm going to do.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.480]   I might be that one splash of red dyeing and gigantic pool, but I'm going to try. I don't
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.920]   know any better. I'm going to go in straight foolish. I'm going to try to make it better.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.520]   And if I did that, and I know you're already doing that, Mike's already doing that, Daniel's
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.560]   already doing that, we could actually affect change. Waiting for one magical person to go
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:36.400]   sprinkle some, whatever I can say, AX33 level dust on the world to make it better.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.720]   It's never going to happen. We have to take responsibility for ourselves. So I don't want
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.400]   to give them a pass because we've been giving too many people past enough as it is. So how
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.160]   about we just try to fix things ourselves? It's pretty clear that Elon is exactly your worst
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:59.920]   case nightmare of having a line people to get so ultimately rich that there's nothing
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:07.760]   anybody can do about that. And this is straight out of the Marvel cinematic universe or DC Comics,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:16.320]   where you get this kind of trollish behavior out of a guy who's, I mean, what if stark industries
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.160]   also, you know, Rob Banks, I don't know. I mean, it's just it's kind of these
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:28.400]   be so looks like Lex Luthor. Yeah, look like I think billionaires are a big, big, big problem.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.080]   And it's dealing. Now, by the way, if I were on the board, I'd be a little terrified at this
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.440]   tweet from Elon on April 7th. Twitter's next board meeting is going to be lit. And there he is.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:47.280]   This is him on Joe Rogan, smoking a blunt. Yeah. That is simultaneously horrifying.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:54.720]   And refreshing. Refreshing. Refreshing. I can't. It's bizarre. It's upsetting because,
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.040]   because I mean, you never provide us with with with weed. So no, but you do bring us.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.320]   Yeah, it's the next best thing I suppose. But you know, you know, I but I love the I love the
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.120]   the direction of this conversation. This is the right conversation. Elon Musk himself as a
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.280]   person, I think is a very laudable person. He thinks way outside the box. He's clearly
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   brilliant. That's his strength. And he's like, you know, we can. I think he doesn't believe this is
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.920]   a real world. I think he's totally in on this simulation thing. Yes. Yes. And then he doesn't
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:27.040]   really think they're humans outside his body. And so he's playing pinball because it doesn't
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.800]   matter. And to a certain extent, the existence of Elon Musk in our world is is some evidence.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.640]   He's low key. Yeah. Clearly. But but it's like he personally, I think, is a laudable person. The
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.040]   system that allows we should somebody who am asked $300 billion and just do whatever they want. And
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:50.240]   is not the best system. So I think we need to yeah, well, we need to vote people.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.680]   You know, essentially point and get the money out of politics. There was a joke, you know, we
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.640]   jokingly said that he might turn Twitter headquarters into a homeless shelter. And
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.240]   just to be get back at them for not doing whatever is going on for the same round and
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.520]   narrative that he brought Twitter for any one of these guys could take what he would have bought
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.760]   Twitter for just to play around with. And instead of making a power play, he could have done
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.800]   something to help child property or actually done something to help a homeless or done something
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:29.040]   to help food deserts and whatever. So instead of taking your play money to buy a company so you
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.960]   can like, you know, slap it around and be funny with your hilarious tweets. How about actually do
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.440]   something to affect? Well, Congress is considerably less than $3 billion. I mean,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.920]   Congress, you could buy for half that. Oh, 10th Congress is cheap. Congress comes very cheap.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.720]   Seriously. I'm actually being serious. If you put that kind of money towards lobbying,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.160]   you'd get Congress to do whatever you want. I think Elon sees Twitter as as as a lever. I think
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:02.640]   he sees it as extremely powerful. And by the way, powerful, in a weird way, because not normal
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.160]   people don't care about Twitter. It's only got 350 million active users. Normal people, you know,
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:14.240]   Twitter, but it has an an outsized thanks to President Trump and all of those 10 celebrities
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.880]   before him. It has an outsized power in the media. Yes. And so if you want to control media,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.480]   if you want to control the over 10 window, if you want to control what people are talking about,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.800]   what a great way to do it. Well, and I think Elon has seen this, knows it. And if I if you give him
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.680]   credit as a smart guy, then he's saying, Well, what can I spend three billions on that would
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.560]   give me the most levers of power? Maybe this is it. I went on a rant a couple years ago on the show
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:50.240]   about billionaire philanthropy. And my theory is that we shouldn't lineize this kind of philanthropy,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.440]   because essentially, once you're a billionaire, you know, 1 billion, 300 billion, what's the
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.920]   difference? Basically, you can't how much money can you really spend and how much happiness can
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.720]   you get out of additional billions? You can't. So once you've bought all the houses and you bought
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.080]   an island in Hawaii and you, you know, you have 100 Teslas or whatever, what's next? The only
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:17.200]   thing left for people like Zuckerberg and Bezos and Elon Musk is influence and power. And so
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.760]   usually they turn to philanthropy to do that. Bill Gates says, Well, you know, I personally like
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.600]   GMOs. So I'm going to just blanket the African continent of GMOs. He's done a lot of great things.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.520]   It's also how you revitalize as Andrew Carnegie did. Yes. How you to polish up the reputation.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.120]   But everybody I think that's what Bill Gates is. Yes, but to a certain. And then Jeff Bezos buys
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   the Washington Post, somebody in the chatroom, right, is saying, Oh, that's even more corrupt,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.320]   except that he's not really making the Washington Post do his bidding. Right. Elon is very, this is a
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.640]   very direct, clear path to power. The Washington Post part is an indirect path to similar kinds of
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.320]   power because, you know, now you really you additionally have to take seriously what Jeff Bezos says
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.640]   because he is the owner of the Washington Post. This is more true. Elon Musk is more direct.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.720]   He's more direct about everything. I mean, everything he does, he goes straight for the jugular and
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   really tries to tackle things that he's concerned about. But but the larger point is every the
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.680]   humanity is always in these conversations and these disagreements about, Oh, should we do this?
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.960]   Should we do that? What's the best way to do this? What's the best way to do that? Everybody
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.440]   is an opinion, including these billionaires. And they use their billions to get their way on those
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.880]   arguments that everybody's having. And that bothers me quite a bit. And it's not democratic.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.440]   Not at all. It's the opposite. And we need to start calling billionaires oligarchs.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.520]   I like it. Yeah. I like it. Yeah. Go ahead. They are. And getting to the philanthropy aspect of this,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.800]   it's really important because, yeah, you know, like Bill Gates, you know, he gets a lot of,
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:47.760]   you know, praise for giving away his billions of dollars, you know, which is it's it is good.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.400]   But part of the problem is he has so much money. He's had to set up a foundation for it. And his
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.640]   foundation creates a bunch of bureaucracy. As Mike was right, it gets directed in certain
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.440]   directions and two policies he prefers and likes. But there's also corruption involved with it
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.800]   because you're talking about so much money. They don't know how to spend it. A lot of money gets
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.720]   lost in the process. And so it would be much easier if that capital was never centralized in the
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.440]   first place. Like they have so many billions that they don't know how to spend it all in one place.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.920]   They can't just dump it into the market. They can't just solve homelessness because it's a
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   systemic problem. So it's like, it would be much easier though if that wealth was just
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.640]   distributed amongst average people, you know, this is the idea behind what made America
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.560]   successful post World War II was a solid middle class. Well, what have we seen the United States
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.000]   the last 30 years, the decline of the middle class. And when the middle class has enough capital,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.160]   everybody is happy. Things are stable. But when you start deteriorating that and the capital gets
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.000]   concentrated in just a few hands, and then they don't even know how to spend it, that's where you
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.920]   really start to get a lot of these problems. So, you know, this is we can't have oligarchs,
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.760]   basically. We just can't have this kind of system. But as long as people love them and worship them
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.600]   and feel like in their head that, oh, someday that could be me. I mean, you bring up Stark,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.320]   you know, this is the Marvel universe. But what made Stark so interesting as a character was,
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.280]   he was completely flawed as a selfish human being who didn't care about human life. And the way his
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.640]   character evolved, you know, changed that he developed the moral compass towards the ends.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.840]   And that's what made him such a fascinating character. From Elon Musk, there's no sign whatsoever of
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.960]   a moral compass. It's all just numbers and abstractions away from that. I think that's,
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.040]   you know, that's what bothers a lot of people. There's no sense of an actual vision.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:41.120]   Well, unfortunately, he does have a moral compass and a vision, but it's not necessarily a good
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.520]   one. I mean, for example, he wants to put a million people on Mars. And he's even said that
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.480]   the problem with the population is that it's not the human population isn't growing fast enough,
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.640]   because he won't have enough people to send a mark. I mean, it's just this is a vision.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.760]   This is a moral, this is a moral company. But the moral compass is just spinning, basically. And
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.920]   you know, this is this is the fear that, you know, what will he do to put a million people on Mars,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.600]   which is to me an objectionable thing. He probably wants to terraform Mars. I don't really like that
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.040]   either. So, you know, I just it's just he should have a voice like everybody else, but he shouldn't
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.560]   have, you know, he shouldn't, in my opinion, I would prefer that he didn't control the most
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:31.280]   important place where people exercise their voice, which is Twitter. Yeah. Actually, the person I
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   would who should most be afraid is that kid who's tracking on Musk's jet. Yeah. Because the very
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.480]   first thing that's going to say is ban him from Twitter. He got by him. So now, now,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.560]   bad. It's just fascinating. It's I feel like we're living in a kind of weird story land or a simulation
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:55.360]   or a simulation. And it's just I fundamentally anti-democratic. And I think that there's a problem
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:04.560]   in this country where we get tired of the democratic process. We want things to move faster. We don't
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.160]   necessarily agree with the decisions that are made. And so we kind of like the idea of a strong man.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:16.400]   Yep. And I think Elon is playing to this. And that's what populism is. And I also fear that he'll
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.280]   want to be president one day. That's I think I hate to say it. Yeah. I think that's where we're headed.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:30.080]   Yep. We are definitely on the path to more quote unquote in air quotes celebrity presidents.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, we had Ronald Reagan. Who stars going to say started that? Reagan. People want
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   to rock as is being said. Okay. If you had a choice between the rock and Elon as president,
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.800]   you're free. I would prefer the rock because the rock is a lot dumber. And he doesn't have a lot of
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:57.600]   ideas. He just wants to be right. I think he's kind of like the last guy. Exactly. Elon Musk
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.080]   would be like, now I have all the power. I'm literally going to do XYZ. Whereas I don't think
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.960]   the rock would really do anything. So he would just be a mediocre president. 2028. Elon in 2028.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.560]   I guarantee you. The thing about Duane is being from Hawaii, our cultural nature is to be nice.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.040]   Yeah. It's just it's how we're raised on. Yes. And he's not you can tell from the things that
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.360]   he's done. Yeah. He's a genuinely nice person. Yeah. A low hot spirit lives within their brothers.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.680]   I wouldn't mind the low hospital. The way to remember remember the president in idiocracy.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.080]   He was a professional. Terry Cruz. Terry Cruz. That's the one. That's where we're headed.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.240]   Oh, terrifying. What is the line? Tell me about the one before we take our break. Okay. Well,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.920]   this line. Okay. So can I tell you the occasion? Yes. Very personal thing for me.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:53.120]   17 years ago, my favorite podcast was posted on the internet. April 11th, 2005. Give or take.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:00.080]   Yeah. And so I think we should sell. We're leaving the country again. And before we go,
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.760]   I wanted to celebrate that with you. April 17th. Yeah. April 17th. Yeah. And it's us in about a week.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.040]   But I thought we should. And so I tried to find a anniversary.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.480]   They they my team was trying to talk me into cupcakes, balloons, a cake. Yeah. And I said,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.600]   that's cheesy. Yes. You know, you know, you don't watch the Ellen show and they're celebrating their
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.480]   17th episode or something. It's cheesy. I don't want to do that. But on the other hand,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.440]   you bring some wine. I'm not going to say no. 17 is not even a legal adult. That's not even
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:38.080]   the age of consent. That's right. So in any event, this is a we tried to find a 2005 wine in our
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:45.520]   seller, aka Kevin's garage. The closest we got was 2004. He has a hydrogen vehicle. So the garage
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:51.120]   does not. It's just a little pools of puddles of water. Yeah. That's it. So it's a domain due
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.560]   grand to now. This is a this is a Chatsunuf to pop wine from 2005 2004. It's closest we could get.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.000]   And this is this one. Yes, I know. At least it's going to be here in about three minutes. Yes.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.160]   Exactly. She's watching at home. She's going on. How dare you? Exactly. So by the way, the chat
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.280]   room always the constant ever the constitutionalist reminds me Elon Musk was born in South Africa.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.480]   Right. He's not eligible to be president. Well, he'll use his power on Twitter to change that
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.000]   danger. Well, I remember Arnold Schwarzenegger for a while was talking about how can we change
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.280]   this to see him as president, actually. He'd be fine. Yeah. Kevin, come on. Get
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.560]   I wish we could get you guys to join us. I'm sorry, Doc Rock and Daniel have that
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.000]   LaFroyg you were talking about or something else. Kevin Elgin is in studio. Come on, you can get one.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.920]   The the founder and creator of Chatterbox is in the studio. So anyway, that's nice. I wasn't
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:54.320]   even congratulations. Yes. I appreciate it. Happy 17th next Sunday. Greatest greatest podcast in
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:02.160]   the world, in my opinion. Well, certainly the oldest. I'll give you the oldest. All right.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:09.520]   I lied. It's a log of only. Oh, but it's even better. It's even better. Yeah. Nice.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:15.680]   I don't know. I think that the Chatter enough to pop might be better. That's quite delicious.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.960]   Our show today.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.040]   Trust me, I'm still sober. So you're glad to be the first out of the day.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   The show today brought to you by worldwide technology. Love these guys and Intel. In fact,
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.600]   I've shared a glass or two with Chad and the gang over at the worldwide technology. Really
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.560]   great company at the forefront of innovation. They work with clients all over the world to
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.640]   transform their businesses. You know, enterprise technologies are a miracle, a remarkable thing.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.120]   But if when you are buying enterprise technology, you don't consider your business strategy,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.440]   your goals and your plans, you're probably not going to buy the right technology. That's why
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:37:00.880]   I love WWT there are totally focused on combining strategy and execution so that the technology
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:07.680]   you use in your enterprise matches your goals. And it all begins for a WWT at their advanced
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.880]   technology center, the ATC. This thing is amazing. Lisa and I went out there a couple of years ago
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.320]   to visit. It's a research and testing lab that brings together technologies from the biggest
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:24.800]   OEMs and the smallest. The people are transforming the space. More than half a billion dollars in
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:31.040]   equipment in the lab. It started in one building more than a decade ago is now in multiple buildings,
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.080]   rack after rack of the coolest technology you've ever seen. And what I love about it,
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.240]   we were there. I talked to the engineers who work in the lab. I said, you have a great job.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.280]   You get to trial and stuff. They said, yeah, it's the fan. It's the best job. We love this.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.880]   But what's cool, and I didn't know at the time, but shortly after we visited, they announced plans
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:57.760]   to make it open to all. So now the Advanced Technology Center offers hundreds of on-demand
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.920]   and schedulable labs. You can run. You can do yourself featuring solutions that include technologies
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:10.160]   like Intel Xeon scalable processors, Intel Optane Persistent Memory, Optane SSDs,
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.720]   everything representing the newest advances in every area of enterprise, multi-cloud architecture,
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.960]   security, networking, primary and secondary storage and data analytics and AI and dev ops
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.160]   and on and on and on. Now, of course, they use it. Their engineers and partners use it to spin
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:34.320]   up proofs of concept and pilots to integrate technologies so customers can confidently select
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:40.720]   the best solutions. And that makes a big deal in your evaluations and your RFPs. It really gives you
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.880]   a better sense of what you're going to get when you move in this new technology. But now you can do
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.760]   it yourself with the ATC. You can test out products and solutions before you go to market. You can

[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:23.840]   Over 17 years, quite a few stand up sponsors who've really been there for us.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.240]   And we are very grateful. Really appreciate it. It's another way you can support us, by the way.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.440]   If you want to celebrate our 17th, I would love for this to be the best week ever for club twit.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.760]   Yes. You've been on club twit. You were in the mirror. We did a great conversation about
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.120]   gastronomat adventures. Yeah. Club twit is ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:50.800]   Access to the club twit discord, which is great fun. Yep. It's a community not just during the
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:58.000]   shows, but we talk about all sorts of stuff from food and wine to autos and hacking and
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.400]   ham radio, Linux. There's the twit plus feed as well, which gives you access to shows that we don't
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:11.520]   put out on the regular feed, things like our untitled Linux show, the Giz. This week in space,
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:18.800]   and this is another reason we love having the club. Club members kind of made it possible for
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.600]   us to try out this week in space. And now Rod Pyle and Tariq Malak have brought that to the
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.280]   public, so it is available to the public now. It took that TV. It's out of this world. We're
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.760]   going to do more shows because we can do shows without advertising support. When you're first
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:39.520]   starting out, it's hard to get advertisers. So that's what club twit lets us do. It's a great
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:46.240]   boon to us and we think it's worth your $7 a month. Can I make a point or club twit and an item in
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:55.360]   the rundown, which is the new research that found that podcasting has a special, people have a
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.360]   special relationship with the podcast. I saw that story. Yeah, yeah. And basically what they
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.440]   were saying is that podcast listeners are, I mean, I'm summarizing here, but they're less crazy
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.720]   than normal people. Less neurotic, I think. Less the word that you want to go with that.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.960]   It's very clinical. They're not. That's true, but not reading lunatics like the average.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:22.320]   There's normal people. But essentially, one of the points they made is that the podcast listeners
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.600]   tend to form a parasocial relationship with the hosts that they had. That's so true.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.920]   Okay, but here's an interesting point about club twit. With club twit, parasocial means
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   you as the listener feel like you have this close personal friendship with the host,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.880]   but the host doesn't have the slightest idea who you are. So it's a one way relationship that feels
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:48.000]   like a normal two way relationship to the listener. And this is true. We've all felt that with our
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.840]   favorite podcast hosts. So we feel like we know who they are, especially you've been doing it for
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:57.760]   17 years. Yeah, a lot of us feel like we've known you for a long time. And I started doing the show,
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:04.640]   I don't know, 10, 10, 12 years ago, something like that. But club twit turns that parasocial
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:10.880]   relationship into a social relationship. Now you're interacting with people on club twit.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.520]   Instead of them just feeling like you're somebody they interact with, even though you don't know who
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.960]   they are, you're actually interacting with people on club twit. And so it's really, that's a different
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:27.600]   relationship. That's not parasocial, the relationship you have with your audience on club twit. And it's
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.880]   very cool. It's very intimate space. Truthfully, from day one, the one thing I wanted to do,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.320]   I knew from being in radio for years and somewhat in television too, that these relationships
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.560]   occurred. You know, you meet people who watch you on TV and they really do think they know you.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.840]   Right. And it's a it's kind of weird for both sides. Yes.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.920]   I wanted to break that fourth wall. I wanted to do with podcasting something a little less
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:58.240]   talking down to people or talking at people. I wanted more community. And it's always been a
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.640]   challenge. That's why we've always had a chatroom. That's why I do talk radio. And it's why we have
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.160]   the club. It's just trying to break that fourth wall. Right. So it's a community,
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.920]   not a speech. You know, you're you're not a member of an audience. You're a member of a community.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.240]   Exactly. That's a hard thing to do. And I hope we're getting better at it. So yeah, please join
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   club twit.tv/clubtwit. Seven bucks a month. But you are all podcasters. Every one of you,
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:27.680]   Doc Rock, you podcast, Daniel, I know you have podcasts at Windows Central. So I think you're all
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:33.600]   aware of that. It's a it's a it's a great medium. And that's a I fear for it to be honest with you.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.560]   Yeah. I was just going to say, yeah, I mean, community building, something we've done extensively,
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.800]   you know, going back to Windows Phone experts or one of those mobile experts back in 2007,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.840]   all the way up through Windows, Windows Phone Central and everything. Like we always
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:53.520]   I always made a deployment whenever I wrote an article or an editorial or review to hop into the
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.720]   comments and to talk to people. And I do that on the YouTube channel as well. And it's funny,
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.400]   because a lot of people don't expect that, you know, you get the the higher tier media out there,
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.720]   they write the review and they're like, I'm done. And that's it. And then there's like, you know,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:14.960]   200 comments, which is great. But the reviewer never has to answer for things they said. And I
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.640]   don't believe in that, you know, I someone makes a critique of my review. Sometimes I may agree
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.840]   with this. Sometimes I don't. But I like to go in there and like have that discussion,
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:29.200]   because that's how I learn. And I like kind of, you know, there's so much knowledge out there,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.720]   especially from your own audience. And I know you know this where you're an audience, sometimes
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.120]   surprises like, wow, you know, I'm more you always have these like weird experts that
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:43.680]   show me up all the time. Yeah. And so it's a great resource. I love interacting with people
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.320]   that way. I think they agree. Yeah. So one of the best friends are people that I originally
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.480]   maybe met in the sorry, a parasocial type relationship, disagree with, but they were able to give me
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.200]   information that let me see light in a different way. And so like I've been building my community
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.520]   on the discord for a minute. I was on Facebook at first, which was horrible because it's just
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.480]   odd place to do community. It doesn't really flow. It's nice. But like, that is my thing. Well,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.200]   it's funny. My job title, I'm a community manager for pieces of software. So like, I'm very,
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.840]   very big on community. People ask us all the time, Hey, what's the best feature? And he came like,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:23.120]   how is different from XYZ software? I'm like, our community. I don't even it's not about cameras
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.760]   or mics or sounds or none of that stuff. It's the community. That's where everything lives. And
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:33.680]   one thing Leo, you always had from the very beginning of Twitter, all the way to down,
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:40.960]   you've always had an amazing community. Right. Right. It's that's been one of the pillars of it.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.120]   Because you can find any group of nerds to sit around and talk story with you, you know, a couple
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:51.760]   times a week. But the community has always been on point. Yeah. Yeah. And boy,
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:47:01.920]   if anything positive has come out of the internet revolution, it's this notion that anybody can
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.720]   have a soapbox and that everybody can talk back to them. Right. And so whether it's YouTube or
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.840]   Twitch or Discord or podcasts, and I want to keep it that way. And I have to say podcasting,
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:18.080]   I feel for a little bit because not just Spotify, but the big companies are kind of coming for us.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:25.360]   And trying they're buying up all of the infrastructure stuff. And I feel like at some point,
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:34.800]   Apple Amazon Spotify want to make this theirs. They don't want RSS. RSS is too hard to track.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.760]   Right. Right.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:44.320]   And so I really, as you who listen to our shows, it's really important for all of us
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:51.760]   to really keep real podcasting alive. Just as in a way, Windows Central is a look back to that
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:58.160]   independent blog, which was such a transformational thing 20 years ago. Right. I want to keep that
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.960]   alive too. And I think blogging kind of got co-opted a little bit by the big businesses and all of
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.520]   that. Exactly. And you know, the same thing happened with blogging that happened with podcasting,
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:12.240]   which is that well, slightly different timing. So there were many, many years where I was the
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.200]   biggest cheerleader in the world for podcasting and some hardcore fans were into it. But the general
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.280]   public was just kind of like, what? Yeah. And really, yeah. And so, and I kept pushing,
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.760]   like, come on, this should this should take over TV and radio. This is, it's asynchronous,
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.960]   it's better, it's more intimate, it's more nuanced, it's more everything. And the public was kind of
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   like, I don't know. And then it happened. And so you have this thing where you have the real
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:40.080]   podcasters like you. And then on one side of it, you have like professional radio, you know, NPR
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   has podcast quote unquote podcast. I come from a radio background. So I disagree with you. But
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.320]   see, that's the beauty of it. Your radio shows are radio show and your podcasts are podcasts.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.880]   Yeah, they're different. You don't do a radio show. I wouldn't be drinking this.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.160]   This delicious wine on my radio. That's right. You have a, you have a, you know, sponsors who,
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:00.800]   who don't want to hear that kind of thing on the radio. But, and then you have like people,
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.920]   people with podcasts who have like an audience of, of zero. I mean, it's like,
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.360]   so many people, so it's a, it's a really weird space and, but, but I love it.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.720]   That was true with blogs, right? Exactly. Yes. That was absolutely true with blogs.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:20.800]   Might been listening to my podcast. Yeah. But no, but that's fine. If you have 100 listeners
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.600]   who care about you and what you're doing, that's 100 friends. It's a community of 100. That's
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.240]   actually a big community. Exactly. Yes. It doesn't need to be massive. In fact,
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.400]   it's a disadvantage because then it's hard to have. That doesn't bother me. What bothers me is the
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.880]   big companies that have like, they try to move their podcasts off to some other, you know, Spotify,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:44.320]   whatever, or who, who try to, you know, sort of have, you know, sleep plus, for example, really
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   bothers me. It's like they, they give you half the show and then like, oh, if you'd like to,
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   listen to the other half of the show. Not to do that with a club because of exactly because of that.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.720]   Yes. It's like, you mean, I don't get the whole show unless I pay for it.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.960]   No. But once people see it as like this way to make money, they want to make more money and more
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   money. Money ruins everything. And they're going to squeeze it. So it's that bothers me. But I love
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:09.840]   the real, the real podcasts. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. So, and that's one of the things Spotify seems to
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.880]   be doing, which is, you know, what they did with Joe Rogan, what they do with every podcast they
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.400]   buy is making, taking it away from all of the open stuff and making it exclusive. So you have to
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.480]   have the Spotify app to listen to it. And I think in the long run, that's problematic.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:30.800]   Advertisers love it because if you're listening on Spotify, they know exactly who you are. They
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.200]   know what you do, what you for a living, they know where you live. And so advertisers can love that.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.040]   Yeah. They can buy you specifically. Right. They don't know what they're getting.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:47.200]   Well, we just had a great conversation about this on a podcast that I was guest on that's
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.360]   not published yet. So it was cool, though, because one of the things that we both talked about is
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.600]   longtime podcasters. The one thing that's missing is there's no real standard on podcast players.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:03.120]   And there's no really good interoperability between players. So like back in the day with
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:09.920]   OPML was trying to be a thing. But there's just way too many players out there that each one can
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:17.040]   even wreck the experience of all the work you put into producing a good podcast, a bad
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.640]   player can ruin that experience a little bit. So I wish there, you know, like with TV standards,
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.760]   we have, you know, IAS, EBU, we have, you know, like a certain loudness at full scale
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.680]   measurements that you're supposed to follow looking at you, A&E television with the extra
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.440]   loud commercials. You're supposed to be at like negative 23 loudness at full scale. So it's nice
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.520]   and even across the board that one station is not louder. Somebody needs to help generate a certain
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:49.120]   amount of standards so that everything comes off. I'm against that. I like it. It should be a mess.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:55.760]   Messy's good. No, I'm serious. Messy's good. You know, there's a movement, a podcast 2.0
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:01.120]   movement you might have heard about from Adam Curry's kind of behind that, which is he's got
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.880]   interesting motivations. He's trying to create a podcast directory that is not censored.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:14.080]   That's job one. But then they want to do kind of new RSS features and so forth.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.360]   And I'm just against too much. I don't want top down anything. Right.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.600]   We can't go back to RSS. Remember having the hand code, those suckers?
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:29.840]   Oh, that's fine. I enjoyed it. Podler, it's a pain. I did it by hand for a long time.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.440]   Yeah. But I just, I don't want too much top down stuff. I think that's democracy is a good thing.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.960]   I guess it's kind of related to our Elon Musk conversation earlier.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.400]   Too much power consolidated in too few hands is anti-democratic. I'm not, I'm getting it.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.920]   So let's not have any rules. Let's not have any additional standards. We have a good enough
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.360]   simple standard that works well enough. Find the podcast player you like. You can listen to
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.440]   your show doc and all of our shows on any podcast player, right? I mean, you know.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.200]   And I think the one thing that is cool and I think a lot of new people, you know, like Mike
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.520]   was just saying, so many new people, right? Which in my community, we call muggles nicely.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:15.920]   The muggles don't know that you can go through seven, eight, nine, 10 players until you find one
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.760]   that you really like. And that's okay. Right. Well, they'll figure out, I guess.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:25.440]   I think a lot of people just use what stock that they came with or had the nerd in their
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.640]   family set them up and they don't, you know, go through various reasons.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.560]   We have a website and we stream as for people who don't want to have a client.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.000]   Right. You just go to the website and click a link. Somebody mentioned that in the chat.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.680]   They one thing about clients is it a Phillip, your device real quick. Yeah.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.160]   Because you're downloading all these. That you don't. Yeah.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.120]   Strange. I like streaming it. I think to some degree, this whole conversation about web 3.0
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:52.320]   is a very related conversation. Yeah. And I think it's the wrong direction. I think it's also
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:58.320]   more centralizing, not less. It's Andrason Horowitz, the VC firm that's really pushing web 3.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:02.320]   They're saying, oh, it's it's decentralized because it's built with blockchain.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.680]   But it's not right. NFTs aren't decentralized. Everything goes through open C. Right.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:13.280]   This is the exact opposite. It's centralized. They're waving the positive word in order to control
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   something that they can't control. Right. It's weird when the powerful people with all the control
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.960]   are like going to set up a decentralized. Yeah. Right. Because that's traditionally not how that
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.280]   stuff gets set up. It's it starts off at like developers and just regular people start building
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.080]   out something like the original aspects of the internet became that. So it's always I always
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.200]   distrustful when people very powerful people are like, Oh, we're going to be centralized. Like,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.600]   why don't we just decentralized everything, including your power, you know, and your influence with
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.920]   money and like, Oh, well, you know, they can't do that. That's too far. I don't know. I'm very
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.800]   skeptical of the web 3.0 stuff. I just just not how this technology is where they
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.000]   systems are supposed to start. So grassroots. Yeah.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:02.800]   Grasp roots regarding podcasting, though, the way podcasting currently is, is that it's about
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.880]   the content. It's about the hosts. It's about the content is about what you hear and see.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:12.480]   And any innovation is going to be, Oh, we'll have a button that does this and we'll sort of have,
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.800]   like, you know, other it takes it away from just having it be pure content. I want to
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.920]   go in a long walk. I want to sit play and I want to listen to the podcast and reverse
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.840]   chronological order of the ones that I subscribe to. I don't want any algorithmic
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.320]   meddling. I don't want any sort of special features. Yes. I just want to immerse myself
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:36.880]   in the in the con in the audio and the content and you can't approve that. Yeah.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.240]   Yeah. I like that. So true. The only thing I do differently is for people who talk really slow,
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.680]   but they got great content. I do like, you like a speed up or one in a five, but other than that,
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.920]   I would you might I like to just get in there and immerse it. But there are some guys who make
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:56:00.320]   great podcasts who just talk slow. I'm like, my brain don't do that. I'm mostly because a
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:05.440]   log of women 16. I'll tell you a secret. I would say more than half of our audience listens at
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.680]   one and a half speed. And when they meet you, they go, boy, you sound drunk.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:16.880]   Oh my God. But one and a half. And he had one and a half speed is like, whoa, that's way too much.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.800]   You got to slow and me down. You're not a go. Yeah. He probably shouldn't be one and a half.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.760]   Right. He's slowly listening to a book. I don't understand it. So play your books for me or podcasts
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.920]   or any audio content. It's always at one and a half at least. Like, how can you listen like that?
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:35.760]   Books I want at regular speed. I liked listening to the podcast that I'm on at 1.5 sound so much
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.560]   smarter and sharper when I'm talking fast to sell. It's true. Very true.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:49.520]   W WDC. Apple has put out the announcement. The invites have gone out. It will be online only,
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:55.440]   which kind of surprises me. What do you think Daniel is? Is Microsoft doing starting to do?
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.600]   Is build going to be in person? I think it is, isn't it?
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   Build is happening. It's actually not in person. It will be again virtual this year.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:11.040]   E3 cancels. Probably not because it's COVID, but because it's failing. It's because it's over.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.800]   They said, "We'll be back next year." But I was surprised. Apple says we're going to have a
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   select few in the audience at Steve Jobs Theater, which means they're probably doing a live stream.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.000]   Call it, bring your developer to workday. Is that what they're calling it?
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.640]   No, that's what I'm calling it. June 6th. June 6th. They're going to have a, I don't know,
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:35.760]   Hunger Games contest or something to shoot. I'm curious if they will, if Tim Cook will come out
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   on a stage and there'll be a person and there'll be an audience, or if they'll be sitting there
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:44.320]   watching a movie of Tim Cook on a screen. They're going to put them in chairs, watching a screen,
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.640]   like everybody. They'll be in the audience. They want some energy in the room and
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.200]   if it's only Apple employees, that doesn't quite-- And they don't really like to press in the
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:58.880]   room because we tend to sit on our hands. And they want cheers to the rocks. For the silliest little
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:05.040]   possible thing. It's North Korea. Let's face it. They want it. You said it. I mean.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.360]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Kim Jong Un. Good morning. No, no, that's wrong.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:17.120]   Kim Jong Apple. Kim Apple. Oh, that's a good name. Kim Jong Un. Kim Apple. Kim Apple from now on.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:23.600]   Yeah, there's a show. Kim Jong Un. Kim Apple. Kim Jong Apple. Is Microsoft not doing any live yet?
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.160]   Have they not announced any live? Ignite or anything? Nothing yet. Like I said,
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:34.000]   a build is May 24th through the 26th, I believe. I'll be online again, which is convenient for a
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.280]   lot of people. I don't expect them. I think the next events for them would probably be a surface
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.840]   event in the fall, I think may happen. But the whole pandemic stuff, it keeps changing dynamically.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:53.120]   So I think companies are still a little skittish about-- Maybe that's wise. Because we don't know
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:59.040]   what B-A2 is going to do. It is starting to run through Rampathruy, New York and DC and, of course,
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:05.760]   internationally. So yeah, maybe it's wise. Google said we're going to do Google I/O,
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:13.040]   their developer conference, mostly online. But I think there will also be some in-person stuff.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:18.800]   Online is good. I think online is great for many of us because, remember, they used to have
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:25.040]   have to have lotteries for things like build and WWDC. Because there weren't enough seats.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:30.000]   And so not everybody could get in. Now everybody can be a developer. Everybody can learn.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:38.320]   Right. And the audience of Greater B-A2, WWDC online is that one of the two or three
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.800]   players in a game that actually have a player that's under funny. You know what I mean? Because
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.840]   Apple TV, because of your iPads and things like that. No, in fact, you can't watch it on
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:56.240]   Microsoft Edge. You have to have Safari. So having a legit player though, because I watched a lot
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.400]   last year from my Apple TV and having the app and everything just made the experience so,
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:08.320]   so good. Now we were live tweeting and yelling and screaming and saying weird stuff and whatever
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.960]   as we tend to do during keynotes and things like that. But it is kind of a nice experience.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.800]   I fully understand the pullback. I just came from a live in-person conference. And it was great.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.360]   I finally see some of my contemporaries in, you know, a meet space and have fun and all of that.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.760]   At the end, the last couple of days, everybody was walking around, okay, I'm gonna go home and
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.560]   start sniffing. Like, what is this gonna be like? So we were happy to get out. But then it was also
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:38.000]   a little bit sketch. So that's what you missed though, is that face-to-face hands-on.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.480]   I'm a hundred percent. There's a certain amount of benefit to that if you're a developer.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.160]   Dream-sifting to the person. Well, part of it's social. But there's even value to hands-on.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.400]   So I don't know. I have mixed feelings about it. But I think it's probably prudent to be on.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.880]   The problem with the Apple events is that the hands-on portion is not that hands-on.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.600]   They shuttled the press into a special room where you're mostly looking at stuff to the glass.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.320]   I know I've been there. I'm on the Blacklist too. It's alphabetical. So I think I'm ahead of you.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:17.280]   Oh, I'm a Blacklist. But basically, they whip you into it. They only invite the pro-Apple press.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.720]   Then they whip them into a frenzy. Then they send them into these rooms where they can
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.440]   maybe touch, maybe just look at close-up the products they announced. And then they're gushing
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.160]   about. Everybody's saying, "Look at me. I'm at the Apple event." It's access journalism of the
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.720]   worst kind. And really, if Apple does have in the future, a year from now, five years from now,
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.640]   they do have a live audience. The purpose of the live audience will be to enhance the quality of
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.720]   the streaming presentation. Because essentially, the audience is a prop to show excitement for
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   what they're talking about. It's also traditional. Back in the Steve Jobs days, the whole Apple event
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.600]   was an event. It was a big, big deal. And the audience, people in the audience, wetting themselves
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.560]   was part of the Apple thing. It's getting so excited about these products. And so, to the
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.000]   extent that they have them, it's all about the stream now. It's all about the stream. If they
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.600]   have a live audience, it's to enhance the stream. If they don't have a live audience,
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.240]   it's because the stream is the only thing that matters. So, it's really the larger world that
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.720]   Apple cares about. Microsoft did have an event this week. The future of hybrid work.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.200]   Was that live, Daniel? Did you go to that? No. That was streaming also.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.160]   It wasn't in person, but it was online stream.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:43.360]   Channos Pena. Did not announce any new products, right? No new products. As a focus on what is
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:49.680]   coming to Windows 11, how the company is trying to meet the needs of businesses, as well as remote
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.880]   workers facing this new hybrid work model, and what they're doing to Windows 11 to make things
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.720]   better, basically. I love it because I don't know if you know this, Leo, but I have a relatively
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:05.040]   newish newsletter with Foundry this weekly called The Future of Work. It's all about this kind of
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:12.640]   stuff. I was just crapping all over the hybrid work concept right on schedule for the Microsoft
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.840]   hybrid work event. Would you like to hear my prepared statement about what's wrong with hybrid
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.440]   work? First, what is hybrid work? Yes. Hybrid work is the idea that you have working in an office,
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.400]   the old-fashioned model, where everybody goes into the office every day and works. That's one model.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.000]   There's the remote model where people are working from home, where they're digital nomads,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.880]   or they're working in some far-flung place. Then the hybrid work model is like,
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.360]   "Okay, we'll have people, either some people coming into the office and other people not,
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.040]   or they have people coming in the office two days a week or three days a week. We might have
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.200]   this thing called "hotelling," which is their special software for this, where you go and you
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:57.360]   check in and you're assigned a temporary disaster. All that kind of stuff. My beef with the hybrid
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:03.360]   work idea is that it's this thing that companies think is a panacea. They don't want people working
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.240]   remotely. They won't want them working in the office. Yet, employees are like, "There's no way
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.360]   I'm going to just work in an office again." The hot desk is the worst of both worlds.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.680]   Well, hybrid work is the worst of both worlds. There's all kinds of problems with the hybrid work
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.840]   idea as a panacea. I think it's your... Why are we doing it?
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.320]   Because the companies can't get what they want. They already bought this office space.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.800]   That is, by the way, the conspiracy theory is, but they own all these buildings downtown.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.160]   They got to do something with them, but they could sell them. Well, some of the tech companies
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.720]   are... They don't have to keep them. Some of the tech companies are buying up real estate left and
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.680]   right, which is kind of curious. Sure, we work. It's going to be huge any day now.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.080]   I love your illustration of the great return to the office.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.760]   Join us careers, hours of endless meetings. You've got an office worker action figure.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.000]   I like it. Sitting in a very old IBM. It looks like a wine.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.200]   It looks like a call to a system or something. I don't know what that is.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.600]   I agree with Mike on this. The term hybrid work, for me, it actually has two meetings.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.280]   You're right. There's this idea that a lot of companies are like, "Oh, you've got to come to
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.200]   the office two days a week. You could do the rest of the remote." For some people, that's a fine
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.960]   solution. Hybrid work could also mean just some of the workforce is remote all the time, while some
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.640]   are in the office all the time, too. It can work in different ways. We face this with my
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:42.160]   parent company, Future PLC. They're in England. They're very like, "We like offices. We want
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:48.000]   people to work in an office." Mobile Nations, a company they bought that we were part, was a 100%
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.880]   remote. We crushed it. You bought us. Why do you want to change that?
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:00.560]   You know who likes offices? It's always the boss who likes offices and the workers who don't.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:07.200]   They like to hold forth. They want to look and make a judgment about how people are and what
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.560]   they're working, all this stuff. Here's the problem with the hybrid work idea. Employees are saying,
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.440]   "Look, we don't want to come into the office." Employers are saying, "Okay, we'll do a hybrid work
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.520]   thing." But hybrid work is about location. It's about flexibility in terms of location. What
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.960]   employees want is flexibility in terms of time and when they do their work. Bosses don't like that.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.400]   Exactly. I want to work from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. Then not work for three hours.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   Whenever you try, the hybrid work is a desperate attempt to get people in the same place at the
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:45.040]   same time. But that's exactly what doesn't work for employers. Industrial age model of work.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:50.240]   Exactly. You're 9 to 5 because your job is putting widgets on an assembly line.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.400]   That doesn't work for information workers. It was not even a necessary. Here's a Goa.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:00.240]   A couple of other people started something called ROWE, Result Only Work Environment.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.600]   What's his face? Jason from the old Base Camp team, they were all part of the free. Jason
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.800]   Free, there we go. They were all part of this thing. It showed effective. I was working on
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.480]   the here. I had a co-working space here in Honolulu. I was working on it here trying to get more
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.480]   people to do it. Everybody was super anti because people have this idea. If I let my people stay at
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.040]   home, they would just go beach. That's just a cool business. It has not been my experience,
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.560]   by the way. At least the employees we have. They were just as hard and not harder.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.160]   Much, much harder. One thing that you free up, and I think people have realized this during
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.200]   the situation over the last couple of years, when you don't have to wonder what your kid is
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.000]   doing at school or how they're doing or if they're safe or if they're still sick or is that fever
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.680]   getting on or whatever, you can focus. A lot of times, to be able to just walk over into the
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.360]   bedroom and see that they're getting their study on doing everything and you can go back to doing
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.640]   your thing, it's fine. The people who didn't like it or the people with bad kids, that's a
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.920]   parenting thing. That's not my fault. If my parents had work at home environment,
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.720]   we were never interrupting in Mizzou because we didn't say things like when mom and dad was
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:18.320]   working, you would be silent. That was just a thing. Part of it, I believe, is a lot of the
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.320]   management people and the bosses, if you will, who feel like the other people are going to slack
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:33.920]   are the bosses who do the most slacking themselves. They're projecting. That's the
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:40.880]   word I was looking for. They're projecting. It's always been stated, if you let people be people,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.240]   they will normally do fine. When you give them the opportunity to be stuck between,
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.560]   "I don't trust you, so I'm going to lean on you," they will do things to see where they can get
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.920]   away with because that's the test. Proof of this in Upstate Washington, a lot of places here,
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.640]   they have these stands. You can go to a vegetable stand in Maui and all the vegetables there,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:10.320]   there's a bucket, you pick up what you did and nobody's jacking vegetables. I did that once
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.960]   for Halloween. I was hoping I wouldn't have to hand out candy. I put all the candy in a bucket and
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.240]   the front door was gone in a minute. Maybe it only works in Hawaii.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:27.360]   That stuff is all over Petaluma. People have butter and eggs, farms and stuff like that,
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.520]   and you just walk and put it in the jar. For farms, for some reason, maybe because you know how much
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.000]   work was done. It's those darn teenagers, those kids on your lawn. Paydays, I didn't put any
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   money into that. The debaruse, I didn't work hard. The funny thing, Mike, and I know you're
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.640]   joking, but the funny thing, if the teenagers are bad, who thought is it? Well, yeah, that's true.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.080]   Yeah. So this ROWE results only work in our office. It doesn't work for everybody. It only works for
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:57.440]   people who have a deliverable that you can measure. Like our editors, for instance, they either get
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.840]   the job done and get the stuff out or they don't. They can work from home if they could.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:06.080]   They need the hardware and stuff, but we've set it up so they can work from home.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.720]   But then there's information workers. And Lisa says this, and I kind of agree with her,
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.960]   there's certain people, like people in marketing, you want them in the house because there is a
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.760]   kind of creative- And marketing types, people who are drawn to marketing,
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   are the kind of people who- They're social. Yes, exactly. I remember working in magazines used to
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.240]   edit magazines for a living. And there was always this huge cultural and personality
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.560]   gulf between the ad sales people and the editorial people. Editorial people wanted to do everything
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.200]   on email. The ad sales people always wanted to have a call, right? Always on the phone,
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.680]   who's talking, always social, always meeting. And the editorial people wanted to be in their own
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.360]   office, like, you know, and all this kind of stuff. But let me tell you something about this
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.160]   deliverables thing that I discovered in Morocco, which was really kind of fascinating. So Morocco-
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.840]   You just came back? Just came back just as a gastronome at adventure in Morocco. Exactly.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.520]   There's a product that's grown only in Morocco called Arganoyle. I love
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.320]   Arganoyle. Yeah, it's amazing stuff. But it grows only in Morocco. There's a little farm in Israel
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.400]   and some other country. But basically it's indigenous to a part of Morocco. I had never heard of it.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.880]   We were in Tangier. We bought some. It's amazing. And it was like, "Oh my god, this stuff is the
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   best oil." It's like a miracle oil. So they roast it for food and the non-roasted versions for
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:30.480]   cosmetics is totally blowing up for cosmetics in the last couple of years and so on. But we went to
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.360]   an Argan... Women do this work and they have these cooperatives. So we went to this women's
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.880]   cooperative for Arganoyle and guess what, Leo? All the women were working from home. So the way
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.680]   they process the Arganoyle... They've got it deliverable. They have it exactly. So they have...
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.920]   They crack the stones of the rock. It's very hard to do. I bet you it's labor intensive. It's labor
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.720]   intensive, but they sit on the floor on a rug and they crack the nuts individually with a rock
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.640]   between a rock and another rock. And then they separate the seed out. And then... So what they
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   do is they deliver the uncrack seeds to their homes. Then in their own time, they crack them.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.160]   And then they bring the crack seeds back to the factory. So it's not about information work. It's
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.560]   about when you can measure the deliverable. It can be anything. Did Adobe have success with
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.120]   Ro? Doc Rock? Did that work for them? Oh yeah. A lot of companies went that way and started that
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.880]   way. And I mean, look at me. I'm in Honolulu. My company is in Massachusetts. We do perfectly
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.520]   fine. But I agree with Mike because I'm in market department. What do we do every day? We huddle on
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.440]   slack. That's our thing. We have a good time because we get to hang out. And I go out of my
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.640]   way to try to visit Mass twice a year just to come in. Not from the hybrid thing, but just to connect
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.840]   with the team, have dinner with the crew, things like that. I do want to tell you, if you haven't
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:56.160]   seen it already, this is probably like two years old. Fantastic video from Business Insider about
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.920]   why Argonne oil is so expensive. And it's so labor intensive in hand. But oh my goodness,
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.680]   it's awesome. It's very, very awesome. And I should play these Argonne oil every day for the
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.480]   beer. Yes. If you think he has a sleek, beautiful beard, it's because it's Argonne. Thank you.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.240]   It's Argonne 100%. I never heard of it. I thought we were getting
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.120]   scammed because we went to the Medina and there's a guy who specialized in Argonne oil. You might have
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.000]   been. So they cut it. They cut the Medina's. The pure stuff you get at the cooperative,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.680]   it's just like heroin or anything else. But they put baby laxative in Argonne oil?
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.560]   Who knows? No, basically it's... No, I know. If you go to the store and look for Argonne oil...
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.360]   Three percent. Yes, yes, yes. It's not whole. Right. But one little factoid,
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.280]   you've seen the photos of the goats in the trees in Morocco, right? Yeah.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.920]   So what they do is the goat herders work with the Argonne producers and they have the goats
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:14:00.720]   go into the trees and eat the Argonne seeds. And 60% of them they spit out and 40% of them they
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.920]   go out the other end. It's really valuable. Either way, it softens the shell mix and makes them
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:13.200]   easier to crack. And so a lot of Argonne oil has actually been processed by a goat.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.400]   Oh my god. And the goats are in trees. Yes, they actually go up in the trees
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.360]   and eat them directly from the trees. And it's only in... Only in a specific part of Morocco.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:29.920]   Wow. It's near Esauera. Between Esauera and Marrakash, there's this Argonne area and that's
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.160]   that's the only place where it grows in the world in any significant amount. I can't believe
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.440]   Doc Rock knew all about Argonne oil. Well, you saw his beard. Man, you got to keep the beard and
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.880]   plus that's how I stay looking young. I still look like a teenage.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:50.400]   So the whole time I had it, I was putting on my cuticles on my nails. It was great.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.480]   And I have not found anything as good as that. Well, you know, Marrakans eat it for breakfast.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:59.520]   It's the most amazing thing. They grind Argonne seeds with almond oil and put honey in it.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.320]   Those three ingredients and they dip red into it. Okay.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:07.360]   It's the most delicious. Yeah, I love Moroccan food. We have a restaurant here. It's so good
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.480]   called Kansaman and they have the best Moroccan. Is that where couscous comes from? Is that couscous?
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:18.000]   Well, it's from the Magraebsu, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, essentially. It's basically where
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.240]   the Berbers live. The Berbers. It's a Berber food. It's a Berber food. They make dope carpet.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:28.000]   Yeah. Dope carpet too. Gastronomad.net. Look at the Morocco experience. You're going to be
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.760]   just back from the one in the spring. Now you've got two in the fall.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.720]   Next one this year and one next year. Yeah, the fall this year sold out.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.320]   Sold out. Sold out. But next year is not sold out. And this is the longest
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.960]   gastronomad you do. It's a two week experience. Two weeks. We go to Chef Shallen, Faz, Marrakesh,
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:55.680]   Mecnass, which is a wine country. We go in the desert. We go to Esawira. Nice.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:03.120]   It's a really glorious experience. What fun. Yes. What fun. And I know all these people. Yes.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.400]   Who are testimonially. Yes. Yes. What fun.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   So what did, do Apple and Microsoft, what did Microsoft announce at this hybrid?
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.240]   It's actually smart at Microsoft to say we're going to help you with hybrid work.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.600]   Because it is challenging for a business. Well, everybody's having analysts.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:25.760]   They're struggling with it. We were doing hybrid too. Some of us are here. Yeah.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.160]   Some of us are still at home. So did Microsoft offer anything of value, Daniel?
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:38.480]   No. Just kidding. Thanks a lot. There it is. Yeah. Probably one of the more interesting things.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.760]   One of the more interesting things I think they did was in Windows 11,
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.040]   they're building in like if you see my background is blurred, right? I'm using
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:53.920]   NVIDIA GeForce. Specifically NVIDIA broadcast is a blur. I need a lot of hard work to do that.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.440]   And actually he's doing it very well. Right. Your hair. I don't see anything.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.920]   It's a, what call it, a key in broadcasting. It's a very, very good key. Much better than you
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.600]   get from Zoom or Google Meet or any of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So this is like, I guess there's
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.920]   the top of the line. But yeah, you need a powerful RTX GPU to do it. So what they're doing in Windows
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:18.000]   11 is they're building in the ability to automatically blur your background and video just in the
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.520]   operating system itself. It does rely on an MPU to be presence, which we see a lot of in the
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.840]   ARM processors, although Intel is of course building out this technology as well.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.080]   It can also do things with the voice and amplify the voice when someone's talking,
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.240]   including if they're walking away from the microphone or moving, it'll keep the audio level.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:42.640]   And so you're seeing a lot of this smart technology. TechCrunch had this very sarcastic.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:48.000]   I thought it was kind of dumb. But like right now, I'm looking at the camera to make eye contact.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.520]   Oh, I know you're going. I hate this.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:58.480]   AI, AI adjustment. Right. And so it's technically not new, right? Apple's been doing it for a while.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.840]   The Surface Pro X by Microsoft has had this feature too for the last two years. So on Skype,
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.960]   it'll do it. It's actually very subtle. Do you have it on right now?
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:12.240]   I don't have it because I don't have the it's not set up on this PC to do it.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.320]   But with the Surface Pro X, you can do it on there. But it's a very subtle thing. So I think
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.800]   TechCrunch is kind of making a big deal about this saying it looks unnatural. When I've used it,
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.000]   I mean, it was almost it didn't look unnatural at all. In fact, it was almost hard to see
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.720]   the difference. It was a very subtle change. But I think that technology, it's just like
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.520]   anything else, even if it does look weird at first, just some tweaking will adjust that. But I think
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.880]   this is a it's a pain to you want to look at your screen, but then you get the camera up on it.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.920]   And so they're trying to just write a little bit more natural.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.520]   When I've seen looks a little, there's something off.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.520]   Everyone looks like Marty Feldman.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:58.720]   So tell me that's like everything right? That's like CGI too, right?
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.760]   Yeah, yeah. It was always a slight. But now it's getting to this point where it's
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.920]   a TV value. Yeah. So tell me again what you're using because we're on Zoom,
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.040]   but you're using something to pre process the video from Nvidia.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.360]   What's the cool? Yeah, actually, well, so the camera I'm using is actually a new one. It's
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.640]   called Lumina, which is kind of a startup. I think they're at Japan, I want to say.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.800]   It's really interesting. It looks really good. It's the first camera that I consider that could
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.680]   actually beat the Brio 4K by Logitech, which has been the long running champ.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:34.160]   But so I'm running and they actually do their own blurring ability, which I have it enabled
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:40.000]   because yeah, so this is running through the computer and I have a RTX 3080 GPU on here.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.520]   And you just install this a free app in video puts out called Nvidia broadcast.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.440]   You just download it to your computer. You technically get away around it.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.480]   There's like a way to get around the GPU requirement even. It'll probably use your CPU more, of course.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.440]   What's using it's you use it to GPU and it uses it to you can blur the background.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.160]   It's also doing my voice. So if I clap over here, it dumps that out.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:07.200]   Yeah. So I don't even have it maxed out. I don't have a maxed out even.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.240]   My senior cat used to always come in on the podcast that you just scream or head off,
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:18.160]   but you never would hear it. I would hear it. So it's using AI on the fly to do this.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.400]   They keep improving and they can do some auto tracking and all this other kind of stuff.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.920]   And that's where you're seeing a lot of this like engineering going into computers. Lenovo has a
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:36.240]   brand new laptop, the Yoga 9i. It's a 14 inch laptop and it has a button, a physical button on the deck
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:41.440]   that you could hit that will blur your background and any video app. So you can just be in any
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.480]   call and you just hit a button and it'll just blur your background on it. This is the best
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:49.280]   key I've ever seen done in real time on a computer. That's really good. It doesn't look good. It looks
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   great. Yeah. So I have a 3080 at home. So I could use the Nvidia broadcast on that with my Zoom calls.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:04.560]   I'm going to blow people away. Wow. And if you have an Nvidia card, that's a free download
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.800]   of video broadcast. Yeah. It's just a free app. Yeah. I feel like you all of that because it looks
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:13.600]   so good. It does look good. And now I have to look at the Luminar as well, which is only 199.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:19.120]   It's less than the Brio. Yes. So I have to take a look at that as well. Wow. It's they're really
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:23.840]   interesting because they're they're focusing so the hardware is very good. But it's the software.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:30.000]   It's almost like a Tesla. We know I own a Tesla. I'm sure some of you guys do too. But like when you
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.600]   bought the Tesla, like the way it evolved over two to three years through the software updates,
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.120]   it's what's really made it an interesting car. This is the same thing going on with this camera.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.920]   They're focusing a lot on the software and AI. And they're going to be tweaking a lot
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.440]   over it for the next couple of months and years and stuff like that, where they're really going to
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.920]   kind of get the most out of it, which is really where cameras and optics are going, right? It is
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.600]   the power of AI. That's really going to improve these things. The only thing I would say, and I
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:59.040]   noticed this when you first came out, it's a it's a little cooler than normal. Yes. Usually I'm
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.520]   more overriding that. Oh, you're overriding that. I'm overriding that. So I could actually put it
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.880]   onto I can change it right now and put it on scene and it will auto adjust. So Dan Rubino himself
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:16.880]   is cooler than he's a cool cat. Yes. Cool. But I'm even noticing on their website that the video
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.400]   that they show on the website is considerably cooler. That's the video on the left than the
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.760]   video from the Sony, which I think actually looks more realistic. So it's funny. Yeah, they
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:31.600]   get the full controls over all that stuff, which is kind of nice. It's all sliders. Yeah, interesting.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.800]   Oh, and it has active calibration. Look, she's holding up a card and it's calibrating. That's
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.360]   kind of cool too. Look at this. I should try that. I actually do have a does it come with a card
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.320]   or do you have a grayscale or a no, I don't think so, but they're they're a cool company. Like,
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.080]   yeah, so I really changed. So this is when I put it on. Oh, that looks great. You can see it
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:55.360]   right there. That's 10 times better. Yeah. Go back to the other one. What was that? I forgot which.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.880]   Oh, yeah. Too many settings. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. Yeah. Yeah. The warmer one
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:08.400]   was that was better. But that's just me. That's just me. Yeah. So I don't care. You can be as cool
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.040]   as you want because you are too cool for school. We're gonna take a break and then we'll come back
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.760]   and talk about the rumors around WWDC as well. Great panel. I love having you guys here. Daniel
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:27.840]   Rubino is the man in charge of Windows Central EIC. Great to have you or sorry, executive
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.720]   editor. Is that different than the EIC? Executive editor? It's like even higher. It's changed. I
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.280]   used to be the executive editor and chief and then executive editor. But yeah, I'm just the
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:43.040]   been there almost 15 years now. Wow. That's the foundation of it. Yeah, you are the legend at
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.680]   Windows Central. It's great to have you on. Mike Elgin for years as editor in chief of Windows
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.160]   magazine. Yes. Now is that Elgin.com. Where can we find your Foundry newsletter?
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:58.640]   So go to, well, just go to Elgin.com and you'll see every week I post it with some information on
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:05.040]   subscribing. So it's like Substack kind of it's a paid subscription. No, it's free, but it's
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:10.640]   it's kind of an odd model. They do a sort of qualified. So it's not really qualified. They
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:15.520]   ask you questions. What do you do for living? All that kind of stuff. And then it's free. So it's
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:22.000]   you know, it's Foundry, formerly IDG. So it's IDG. Oh, yes. Exactly. And did you like their CMS? Is
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.720]   that part of the? It's basically, I just submitted it as a, you know, submitted and they posted and
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:37.120]   it goes out and so on. And we're working to transform that whole newsletter thing. But right now it's
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.800]   you know, it's an email newsletter. Some very I love this picture. Street signs in the Medina and
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:50.000]   Feds, they will not help you. That's right. You will get the most. I think that's safe bet. Yes.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.080]   I have no idea what I'm looking at. Doc Rock is also here. He's community manager at EECAM,
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:02.160]   which by the way, is really great software for anybody. Oh, you got one of those. Look at that.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.840]   And even if you want to see the Sony don't calibrate, I got to reach back there and press
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.120]   them. And you're using the Sony. Which Sony are you using? Right now I'm using the ZV-E10,
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:17.760]   but the bokeh comes from a Sigma 16 1.4. I also have the. Oh, see, he's doing an optical. It's
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.800]   called optical. And I'm looking looking down a teleprompter too, right? You have a teleprompter
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.680]   and everything. Wow. Let me show you. Let me show you. Because it's actually super simple to do.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.080]   I just hold on my iPhone just like this. Yeah. Press over here. Switchs over to the iPhone.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.280]   Look at that. There's all of the cool. There's the chat room. Nice. They're on the Mac studio.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.040]   Some ways to go to the studio speed for the chat. And then we're over here.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.400]   And I'm going to create a chat needs as a studio ultra. Is it an ultra?
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.680]   I know I got a Max Max Max. You know what? I'm glad I got the Max. I want to talk about that too.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:55.520]   DP review had a very telling benchmark between the Max and the Ultra. I thought was fascinating.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:01.920]   Great to have you Doc Rock. You take that. Come slash Doc. Is it Doc underscore rock or just no one
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:10.000]   work Doc Rock TOC or just about everything RCK RCK. Oh, okay. We're the extra thousand in the USA.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.400]   Our show today. Coolest name is Doc Rock to the rest of us. I don't even know what his real name
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.440]   is to be honest. It's Sean. But the Doc Rock came from when I was a paramedic in the army. I was
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:27.040]   also DJ and one of the nurses. She was a civilian nurse, but she was an older lady. And so she's to
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.760]   call me Dr. Rock and roll. My original DJ name was Yogi and I was like, that name is dumb. But this
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:37.840]   over here caused me incredible. So I switched it to Doc Rock and sure for Dr. Rock. But like P.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.640]   Diddy, you could use Sean, but you choose to use Doc Rock. I like it. Yeah. Because there's way
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.960]   too many of us. You know, the time I was born. Everybody is named Sean. It was his way.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:52.400]   Our show today brought to you by the single best way to do your cell phone
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:59.440]   mobile. I've been telling people this for years. Why are you paying incredible insane amounts of
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.920]   money every month for wireless when you could save so much by switching to Mint Mobile? It is
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.800]   literally the easiest way to save this year. And you can shop around. You will not find a better
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.160]   deal. How does Mint Mobile do it? They were the first company to sell premium wireless service
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.360]   online only. No stores, no overhead. They don't spend money on anything. Mint Mobile
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.640]   passes those savings along to you with incredible, incredible wireless service as low as $15 a month.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:36.400]   And I actually saved because I got a Mint Mobile iPhone SE for 15 bucks a month. The Mint Mobile
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.680]   service for 15 bucks a month. So brand new phone plus service less than 30 bucks a month,
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.000]   which is a third of what I was paying for the same wireless service from T-Mobile.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.880]   It's unbelievable. All plans come with unlimited talk and text. Yes, of course. You can unlimited
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:59.520]   talks and text nationwide plus high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:06.720]   It's on T-Mobile. There it is. So now you know, if T-Mobile works for you now, switch 5G on T-Mobile
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.480]   that ultra capacity, mind boggling, you'll get all of that. You could bring your own phone if you
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:17.360]   want with any Mint Mobile plan. Unlike everybody else, they'll even send you a SIM for free,
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:23.040]   port your number over. You'll keep your same number, keep your contacts, or you can buy a phone
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:27.520]   from them as I did. They make it easy. With Mint Mobile, you choose the amount of data that's right
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:33.440]   for you. You don't pay for data you'll never use. Switch to Mint Mobile, get premium wireless
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:42.080]   service starting at $15 a month. Yeah, for gigs a month, 15 bucks. Ain't nobody needs more than
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.280]   four gigs a month. That's plenty. You need 10. Okay, go knock yourself out now. It's 20 bucks a month.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.360]   You see what I'm saying? Mint Mobile.com/twit. Get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:59.440]   month. Get the plan shipped to your door for free. Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month. Mint
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:08.160]   Mobile.com/twit. This is the best kept secret for saving money. Everybody, I'm trying to keep it.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.280]   I want everybody to know mintmobile.com/twit. Thank you, Mint Mobile, for supporting this
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:24.560]   weekend tech and saving our listeners a ton of money. Pause. Mint Mobile. Sorry. I use Mint Mobile.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.560]   Yeah, because you're smart. Me too. Yeah, because you're smart. You know, it's funny
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.760]   with your year at their conference. I did. That's what I did. I bought a $300 plan for a year.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:40.160]   I mean, it was incredible. It was a Black Friday special. When iPhone first came out with dual
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.800]   sims, I just wanted something to play with. And so it was a cheap way to play. And then I ended
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.440]   up liking it. It was funny. It was in San Diego last week. The AT&T service was just horrible.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.080]   And then some say, Oh, going your phone and switch the thing to mint. And it was ridiculous. Yeah,
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:30:00.800]   it was incredible. I like that. I have to say both Verizon, AT&T and T Mobile now are rolling out
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:08.480]   this mid band 5G. And if you're lucky enough to be near a tower, unlike millimeter wave where
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.480]   nobody's got it, you have to be so close to a tower. It's ridiculous. Pretty much everywhere.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:19.200]   A lot of metros. I'm surprised at the places I'm seeing it. And I'm getting like 500 megabits down.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:25.680]   It's incredible. Wow. It's incredible. It says you see on your Mint Mobile or T Mobile phone,
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:32.720]   I think it says UW on your Verizon or AT&T phone. We did not yet say what the rumors were about
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.760]   June 6. We will cover that by the way, Michael Sergeant. I'll cover the keynote, whether it's live
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:45.680]   or on Memorex. We'll still be there to cover it. And the rumor is that this is brand new hot
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:53.280]   off the presses from Mark Gurman that they might well announce an M2 based Mac book air,
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:00.080]   which increasingly I'm feeling like you're foolish to try to buy
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:08.320]   higher end MacBooks, spending three or six thousand dollars. The MacBook Air is perfect in
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:16.240]   every respect. And it's just as fast single core as every other M1. And I think Apple is maybe,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:24.000]   I don't know, DP reviewed it a very interesting head to head between the ultra and the Macs. You
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.560]   have a max. I have a max at home. I'm not going to show this to Lisa who has an ultra.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:35.760]   But they tried all of the photo apps that you might use. And they found with the with one
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:42.160]   exception that there was just a minor bump going from max to ultra $3,000 more in price,
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:48.560]   but a minor bump. This was the only exception Lightroom Classic where the ultra was in fact
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:54.560]   twice as fast. Now I know a lot of people use Lightroom, not Lightroom Lightroom, Lightroom CC,
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:32:00.640]   you know, the classic edition. But they looked at, you know, would I use Capture One
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:06.400]   minor improvements like they said, barely generational a few seconds.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:13.440]   Most of the programs people use not a huge difference. What is your experience? I think
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.920]   glad you got the max or do you wish you had the ultra?
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.560]   You know, I part of me do wish I had the ultra, but I got the max because I know,
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:26.640]   I know in the bottom of my heart that it will be finished by the end of 2022 means November is
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:31.200]   you're going to get a Mac Pro. Is that what you're going to get? So I got a studio max, max,
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:37.040]   Mac as a stop gap. But I also say, I understand where everybody goes with this stuff when the
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.280]   stuff first comes out. This machine has been sitting on the desk for all of two weeks.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:47.520]   I also know that every software manufacturer, once they have them in hand, not to development
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.720]   machines, but the real machines, they go in and they tweak and somewhere around late June, July,
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:33:00.160]   especially after WWDC with increases in, you know, Mac IDE platforms, they will fix everything
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:04.560]   and everything will work. So when you think Apple, true. Yeah, but what you think with Apple with
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:09.680]   Final Cut Pro would have absolutely optimized it and look at the difference between the ultra
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:14.480]   and Macs. They didn't have enough time. Minimone, as you don't, they had enough time because remember,
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:20.480]   we just got the max in November. And I think they said we need to get this out before, you know,
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:28.560]   at this right time, so money wise, but we can fix. So I think a 10.7 FCP is right after WWDC,
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.480]   and we'll start to see some improvements. Also, ancillary hardware that goes along with this stuff
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:40.320]   also needs to catch up. So yeah, and honestly, in the pro space, everybody's still premier,
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.320]   which only have, but does it anyway? I was going to say that. Well, I only have
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.400]   does anyway. So there's yeah, here's Premier's benchmarks and Adobe has made it in one
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.160]   compatible, but you're right, they probably haven't optimized it for the M1, but again,
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:00.560]   a very little difference in the max and the ultra effect. Yeah, premier just got M1 like
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:07.200]   loveability recently. But even for Final Cut, it took it like two updates to catch up when we
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.960]   first got the M1 and this Apple's theme. Once it was said, Oh my goodness, it's glorious, right?
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:20.400]   So I think to your point about the MacBook Air, the tech versus us guys, right? All of us
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:26.160]   sitting here at the table, we're a small segment of the normal populace. Like we're most
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:33.440]   of the eight that is in a K video myself, right? Right. So it becomes echo chamber. But to the
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.520]   wifey and my niece and mother in law, stuff like that, they will love M1 MacBook Air,
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.240]   how quick it is and what it does. And for what they're doing on a daily basis, they will be
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.000]   absolutely stoked. Yeah. And it's so funny that in our space, people like myself and my Renee
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.720]   and you and whatever, we all get into this echo chamber yelling at each other about these bench
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.520]   marks and a benchmark means I scratched the table to her. You know what I'm saying?
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:07.120]   I can't believe you scratched this family heirloom. That's a benchmark. Like not how fast you
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.400]   mean a mark on the bench. Yeah, I get on an actual actual bench. Not not how fast my
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:20.800]   Nvidia 1030 can do this Saturday. Next thing. And I wish we would be more open to understanding
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.480]   when these companies make these changes. Like it's only we're a small segment. And I understand
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.240]   it does affect us. And I know we want things to be better. But like outside of me, nobody else in
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.640]   my family cares about Apple versus Epic, not a single one of them. They have no, they probably
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.000]   don't even know what's going on. Yeah, Hollaback. They have no idea what that means. Right. And I'm
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.400]   not a small family. So I just wish we would understand that. And well, I understand that.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:54.000]   But we do shows for the people who know what Epic for Yappell is. All right. I'm not talking to
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.600]   your family at all. I mean, I was going to be on Twitter and they're like, what is that?
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.960]   That's that. Yeah. Why would you want to be on Twitter? By the way, good to good on Epic.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:12.960]   Fortnite raised 144 million dollars for Ukraine relief. And just a matter of days, I think,
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:19.840]   they did a two week fundraiser, 36 million dollars in the first day alone funds being put
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.800]   toward direct relief, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Children's Fund
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:30.400]   World Food Program. That's not alone, though. I mean, game, the game companies are really stepping
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:41.040]   up riot games. Did a bundle of 100 games on HIO raised 5.4 million. Humble bundle raised 20 million.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.240]   So gamers are stepping up more than the Russian military spent on communications.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:56.560]   Probably. Probably. Oh, those jacked radio calls are both interesting to listen to and a little
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.600]   bit freakishly scary at the same time. So tell me about that. Because I'm trying to,
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.080]   every time I turn on the TV, it's all about the war. And I, you know, I look, it's a horrific,
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.360]   horrible thing. I'm just a little fatigued. So I haven't seen all the latest. They're stealing
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.960]   Russian telecommunications. Well, yeah, because their radios are
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:21.840]   encrypted. Well, encrypted. And then so these guys are like talking to their parents on some cases,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.600]   some cases they're talking to their higher ups and the higher ups and telling them to do
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.600]   stuff that they don't want to do. And they're like, no, so like, no, you have to. And these guys
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.760]   are like, okay, you hear them think disconnect the dudes walk away. Like it's awesome. It's scary
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.240]   and it's upsetting. But at the same token, like, he's got like, you lied to us, you say we're going
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:46.000]   to get money and medals is not even one. The medals no more. I'm out of here. And the guy's like, no,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.600]   wait, you do this, or you're going to get in trouble and click. You've served in that combat
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.880]   situation. Yeah, that's why it's scary. And it's nuts. Because I'm hearing the commands that
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:01.200]   they're giving because that's not what the people are being told. And again, there's nothing to do
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.640]   politically to throw out it out. Just be a human, right? Regardless of how you feel about anything,
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:11.760]   just from a human standpoint, they have somebody tell you to look somebody else in the face and do
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.560]   something mean when they're civilians. They're not part of the game. Like that's been the rules
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:22.640]   forever. Civilians are off freaking limits, right? Now, have we done dumb stuff before?
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:28.080]   Absolutely. Right. But we don't go out of our way to do it in theory. Yeah, right. So we're told
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.600]   anyway. And so I guess I understand hearing the guy listening to the higher ups, like I'm not
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.840]   going to listen to this person. I understand that because we did the same thing.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.240]   There's a lot of that in Vietnam too with people. It's troops turning on their
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.120]   commanding officers and stuff like that. But the tech story here, Wired had a great story on it.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:53.200]   There's a US company called Primer. What they're doing is they're in real time able to feed the
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.840]   unencrypted communication by the Russians into this AI system, which simultaneously in real time
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   translates it. And it basically, you can be listening to hundreds of these communications and it will
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.080]   surface the ones that are of particular interest. Somebody's saying, "Oh, we're about to attack the
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:23.120]   key or whatever." And it's the contrast between the capability of this private company that doing AI
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.520]   and the fact that the Russian military doesn't even have the capability or the will or the wherewithal
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:37.440]   or whatever to encrypt their military communications is just a stark contrast. It's really a stunning
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.720]   contrast between these communications capabilities. But this is just devastating for Russian military
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:50.160]   because they're just listening in English to this Russian chatter in real time. And so some of this
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:57.440]   presumably is getting to the Ukrainian military leadership and helping them in some way. But it's
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:04.960]   really fascinating technology. One of the things we've been watching and interested in is cyber
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:11.680]   warfare between Russia, Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. We've done Microsoft actually,
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:18.720]   did something to disrupt attacks against Ukrainian targets coordinated by apps 28, the Russian
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:25.120]   hacking group. Tell us about that, Daniel. What exactly happened?
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:31.680]   Yeah, so they have a process, Microsoft now, where they can just go to these courts and get
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:37.840]   immediate orders to shut down these servers and the hardware, the infrastructure that these
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.480]   hacking groups are using. Are these servers controlled by Microsoft?
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:47.120]   No, that's the thing. They're getting control, but they're going to support the
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.720]   mission to hack, basically. Yeah, they're getting to take them and then
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.000]   redirect the traffic to a sinkhole. And so the traffic goes nowhere. And so they've been doing
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.160]   it for a while now, but this was just another volley this week where they found a bunch of other
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.440]   servers in this group going after Ukrainian telecommunications and just trying to stop their
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.400]   infrastructure. And yeah, Microsoft's been very good at it. It's very interesting how
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.560]   companies like Microsoft play a role in this kind of new era where they're not governments,
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:28.640]   but they have enormous power to sort of combat what is a new form of military warfare.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.920]   And it's just, I don't know, it's like, I'm happy Microsoft's doing it. At the same time,
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.080]   it's like, it's scary how it could be reversed. It's a lot of power.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.480]   But as they're getting court orders, they're doing it in a lawful fashion.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.320]   Right. Not just vigilante freelancing, shutting these things down. I don't understand how they
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.640]   shut them down though. If they're not controlling the servers, how are the,
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.280]   dudes is Microsoft to have a hacking team that's getting in there and saying, okay,
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.200]   now we have the capability, get a court order.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:05.120]   Yeah, I don't know. You know, the actual ends now of how this has happened. I have been
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:11.040]   able to re directing the domains, as you said, to a sinkhole that Microsoft controls.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:18.240]   So these are, I presume command and control, you know, chatbot kind of things.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:24.240]   Yeah. And they're somehow taking the traffic coming out of these control servers and saying,
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.480]   you go that way. Maybe be with BGP routing. I don't know. I wonder what they're doing.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.680]   I'd love to find out. You know who might know? Steve Gibson.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.160]   Probably look, I'll get Steve to look into it. Throw it at Steve. Steve will do it.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.120]   So according to, according to Tom Burt, who's corporate vice president at Microsoft,
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.960]   this disruption is part of a long, ongoing long term investment started in 2016
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:53.520]   to take legal and technical action to seize infrastructure being used by Strontium. Strontium
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:59.520]   is the name of the hacking group. That's Fancy Bear, apt 28, ABT 28. They all, I don't know why
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:05.280]   they have so many names. I like Fancy Bear, though. That's my favorite. Yeah, right. It's a good visual.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:13.200]   So we've established a legal process that enables us to obtain rapid court decisions for this work.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.400]   They obviously have some sort of liaison with the court. Fascinating the Microsoft. But you know,
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:26.480]   who better? I mean, if I'm the NSA, I'm saying, yeah, yeah, you do it. Go ahead. We'll support you.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:32.160]   But here's the thing. In a cyber war, the targets are also companies like Microsoft. So
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:39.760]   there's no separation between private companies and all outside or warfare. They're going to go
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:46.160]   after every tech company, every, you know, and so it's kind of good to get companies like
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:51.200]   Microsoft engaged because they are also protecting themselves. Yeah. In fact, the domains not only
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:57.200]   were used to target multiple Ukrainian institutions, including media organizations, also in a tax
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:02.720]   against US and EU government institutions, and think tanks involved in foreign policy.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:09.440]   So yeah, I mean, I guess one way you could do it is if you analyze the malware and you
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:13.600]   saw that the malware pointed people to these command and control servers. Now you know
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.720]   where the command and control servers are. You don't have to actually go and get them physically.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:24.400]   You can reroute their traffic, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna ask Steve. That's fascinating.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.440]   Yep. Question. Yeah. Apple has finally gotten its cajunis.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:40.560]   Yes, as you may remember, the Russian government asked the App Store in Russia, the Apple App Store
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:47.440]   in Russia to take down an app sponsored by the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Days before
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.520]   Russia's legislative elections, this was after pressure from the Russian government.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:57.760]   Apple exceeded. They took it down. Voters went to the polls. I don't know what happened, but
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:05.040]   probably didn't go well. Apple has now restored that app. They've restored that app.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:11.200]   Of course, there's no election going on, so I don't know. Both Apple and Google did this,
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.600]   removed the apps right before the election. Yeah, Google put it back right away.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:22.080]   And Apple was playing like, oh, what's going to happen? Just the good thing to do, whatever.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:27.920]   Google did it like a couple days after. So yeah, I wish they had it done it faster, but you know,
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.760]   let's just say it's there now, because one of the things that happened, although you might not
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.800]   be able to use it for voting right now, apps or apps, so when you update them, maybe they can
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:41.920]   slip in the news section and start talking about what's really going on, as opposed to what's not
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.320]   going on. So my guess is they didn't put it back right away because I like elections over no big
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:50.480]   gig. But now the app can be used for something else. Maybe they're being used in live streaming
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:56.240]   with somebody telling the truth or having some Ukrainians in there or whatever to say what's
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.800]   really going on, or guys who ran away like the soldiers were talking about. So that's the good
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.480]   part about it. One of the reasons, and one of the pressure points the Russian government had,
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.120]   one of the reasons Apple and Google had to give in to the Russian government, is they make them
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:15.680]   have personnel in Russia that can be arrested. And so according to ours, Technica,
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:21.360]   who's writing this? Someone just give him credit. Timothy B Lee, he says,
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.640]   Tim Lee, yeah, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple had let many or all of its Russian employees go,
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:33.360]   because they stopped selling iPhones in Russia in February. And so then the Russia government no
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.280]   longer has these pressure points. And so maybe that's what happened.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:42.720]   I mean, the Putin government is essentially a mafia organization. And this idea of arresting
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.600]   employees is a way to pressure a foreign company to do its bidding. And essentially,
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:56.880]   you know, suppress speech and suppress political dissent is just another example of why everybody
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:02.480]   is very unhappy with Russia these days. So it's good that they're finally doing it. I don't know
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:09.840]   the very, I don't know the details, but they're obviously it's, this is one of the issues that
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:14.400]   I've been writing about for I don't know, 10, 15 years, it also comes up with China.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.000]   What do companies do to what extent do they cooperate with authoritarian regimes when the
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.560]   penalty is to be expelled from the country and to lose market share to one's competitors?
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:31.680]   It's a real, it's a problem. There's a scale, right? There's a point at which,
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:37.280]   if for example, the Chinese government said, okay, we want Tim Cook to personally come to
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:41.520]   stadiums in China and execute prisoners with a revolver.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.320]   We're not going to do that.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.360]   He would say no. So there's some somewhere between that and like cooperating to a certain
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:52.480]   extent. There are other companies like Cisco and networking companies that participate in the
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:59.680]   Great Firewall of China. The authoritarian regimes are always pushing to see how far they can go.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:06.800]   It's a tough call, but in this case, Russia has gone so far off the rails that companies like
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.000]   Apple can be insanely selling products. There are no longer selling products there anyway.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.880]   But it is ultimately economic. Apple could say, well, no, because we'd care about those poor
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.480]   people who are employees in Russia, we didn't want them to get them arrested,
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.720]   but you don't have to exceed to the government and say, we're going to have employees there.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:24.480]   You're giving in to them for economics.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:31.520]   I always oppose the rationale. So let's say, for example, let's say the Chinese government wants
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:37.040]   Apple to remove certain apps from the App Store because they're used by the opposition for one
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.440]   thing or another. And Apple says, okay, we'll remove those. And then Apple's defenders will
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.720]   say, well, they have to. They have to obey the laws in the countries they operate in.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.160]   But I would say, but I would say that they don't have to operate in those countries.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.200]   They're helping the Chinese Communist Party's
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.720]   suppress democracy and censor free speech, and they're doing it for the money.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.560]   Let's be clear about what's happening.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.800]   That's the clearest way you could put it.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.520]   Boy, this show turned into a commie fest.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.000]   Yes.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000]   You guys first were getting the oligarchs. Now we're pulling out of China.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:10.880]   Google did it.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.160]   It's easy for us.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.760]   Yeah, easy for us to say.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:18.400]   I have not yet pulled my podcast from Russia or China. I just want to say,
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.880]   I bet you we have listeners in Russia and Ukraine.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.720]   I can see no benefit. No, no, no,
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.960]   Twitter listeners going to pressure Putin because we pull the podcast from Russia.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.800]   We could turn this whole war around, actually.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:36.000]   You know, one of the things that we claim the grips with right away when when the S,
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.960]   you know, hit said proverbial fan is as Mac users, we have so much software that we know and love.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.440]   And I'm sure it's someone who windowside to a lot of windowside to that are just made in
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.600]   Ukraine, right? The whole riddle team, Rita, sorry, who we spent many a time with at Mac world.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.840]   All my set app stuff, like so much of it.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.040]   Back in the winter.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:57.600]   Love Mac.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.480]   All right.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:58.880]   Yep.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.000]   Yo, man, those guys are so much fun.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:02.480]   Skylo.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:03.520]   Great to hang out with.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.520]   Skyloom, which I use, right?
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:05.840]   Yep.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:10.480]   So like there's a lot of stuff that's there that we use all the time.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:18.720]   And so we originally had the notion of just caring about our friends because we know these guys from
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:22.960]   from conferences and stuff. And then so I'm sure a lot of that's on the other side is too.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:31.120]   So again, yes, it's kind of a messy situation. And I'm sure Mike can say there's much more
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:37.200]   elegantly than I, but the part of the reason why we're where we are right now, even with something
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.760]   like that, right? As much as we have always great tools we use from the Ukraine back when we had
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:48.080]   our chance to dump money into education for tech and tech growth, even as we were growing the best
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:54.640]   tech companies in the world with IBM Intel, Microsoft, Apple, all of the above, our government
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:51:00.400]   wouldn't put any money towards educating the tech. Those of us nerds who wanted to play, we fought
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:06.720]   over three computers in the lab. Some schools didn't even have one, you know. So we kind of dug this
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:12.400]   hole for a reason why so much good software is coming out of Belarus and Ukraine and the old
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:17.920]   Soviet republics, right? Israel, Israel. Yeah. They got a lot of gaming in the Ukraine too.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:23.840]   Yeah, that's right. And we just didn't do it. Even back in the beginning of, you know, Xbox and
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:30.800]   PlayStation and, you know, multiplayer games, I can't speak English today, you know, South Korea,
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.800]   because I was living there at the time, you know, the internet was just dumb fast, right?
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:40.560]   Japan, the internet is ridiculously fast. You could be underground in a tube pulling 175 up and
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:46.240]   down. No company here wants to give you 175 up and down in the mobile without thinking that
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:51.440]   you're going to just watch to us Netflix and kill the bandwidth as if it's a finite thing,
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.720]   you know? So like even to this day, we have caps on dumb stuff and a lot of places don't.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:02.720]   And this leads people to just become better at what they're using the tool because they're using it.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:07.920]   Our people here in quote unquote demarcutize, you know, rich is coming in the world. We have
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:14.080]   to worry about how much I'm going to send because cops might, you know, cap me, like really? Why?
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:21.280]   Yeah, I understand. One interesting dimension of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as far as technology
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:30.160]   is concerned is the use of apps for smuggling. So information and also money. So for example,
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:36.640]   for a while, I don't know if it's still happening, people were using Airbnb to basically book
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:43.360]   rooms in the Ukraine. I remember that. Which they didn't have any tension of going to Ukraine and
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:51.760]   staying in those rooms, but as a way to transfer money from wherever to Ukraine. And there's a
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:57.600]   Ukrainian company that has a photo app that's very popular in Russia. And they're using the pop-ups.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.000]   They're using the notifications of that app to inform Russians about what's really happening
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.480]   in Ukraine. And so it's bypassing everything because it's an app that people already have
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:14.160]   installed on their phones. And it's really kind of fascinating. I've been sort of working on a
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:19.280]   piece for a while about all the different ways that the app ecosystem represents a sort of an
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:27.520]   underground railroad or sort of a secret pipeline for information, for funds transfers and so on.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:34.160]   That really can't be effectively shut down. It's an interesting development that is unique to this
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:41.680]   conflict, but won't be unique in the future, I don't think. We have a chatter who's from Kavik
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:50.400]   Kiv, Bodex in the chatroom. And he's in Slovakia now. He's evacuated. But he was from Kiv. And
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.320]   he's listening to the show. So welcome Bodex. It's great to have you. I hope your family's okay.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.400]   Yeah, I'm just told I'm happy, safe, man. I'm just like, every time I get to hear from
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.680]   somebody from the region that's somewhere safe, it makes me feel better. I know that
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:07.920]   selfish, whatever, I'm sorry, I'm going to take it though. I just want to see you a little hop from
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:13.040]   a lawyer, brother. And I'm skeptical. So I did verify his IP address and he's coming to us for
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:21.920]   some money. I know people just in foes everywhere. I know people. Let's take a little break. Anyway,
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.760]   God bless you and hope you're okay. And God bless everybody in Ukraine.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:32.480]   Hope you're doing okay. It's tough right now. It's very hard to watch, I have to say.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:38.000]   Let's take a little break. Come back with more great panel. We will talk a little bit about
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000]   because Kevin's in the house about chatterbox. Kevin's amazing solution. Yes. We're teaching
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.720]   kids about voice assistance without intruding upon them. And helping with the problem Doc Rock
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:55.920]   was talking about, which is investment in getting kids perfect example. Yeah. Hello, chatterbox.com,
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.920]   a smart speaker that teaches literacy, computer and AI literacy. It's really cool.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.840]   You got Raspberry Pi's now. Where'd you get them?
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:12.160]   Okay, good. Because I know that was one of the things holding you guys back is
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.520]   it runs on a Raspberry Pi and getting them has been really hard in the last few months.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:23.760]   I'm glad you got some. Hello, chatterbox.com. We'll talk more about that later in the show.

[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:24.720]   Stamps.com. Thank you, Stamps.com. For supporting us through this,
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:32.640]   but it has been a difficult time for podcasts, I have to say. I am very excited about Unreal
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:38.080]   Engine 5. This is something Apple will not probably have because it's from Epic.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:44.800]   I'm curious what you think, Doc Rock, about does it matter that Apple doesn't have access to the
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:50.160]   Unreal Engine? Look at this. Look how beautiful this is. It's amazing.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:57.440]   It's tough to say because I think one thing that's going to happen, and it might be a couple more
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:03.120]   generations out, but as we get more and more work on these SOCs that they're creating,
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:10.160]   eventually one of the gaming companies will take the leap and a bunch will follow because
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:16.080]   tech-wise, the thing is incredible. It's absolutely incredible. But somebody has to
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:21.200]   bite the bullet and do the thing and make the first one, whoever does it first wins.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:27.440]   I think people will recognize this good machine. That being said, I don't know, console gaming
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:34.160]   to me is dope. Maybe I'm just old. No, it's funny. I just prefer my console because it's in a bucket.
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:40.720]   I try to play Elden Ring on my fancy, dancey PC, and it wants a console controller, and I put it on
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:47.280]   the Xbox, and it's great. I'm perfectly happy playing. I still get my ass kicked, but I'm perfectly
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:52.560]   happy playing Elden Ring. But it looks beautiful when it's happening. I know it's probably better
[01:59:52.560 --> 02:00:00.240]   to play Flight Simulator on a PC, but I put Flight Simulator on my Series X. It's so much fun. I
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:05.120]   didn't think it'd be fun just flying around. Now, Flight Simulator might work on the Mac, but will
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:11.920]   it use the new graphic stuff? That would be pretty crazy balls. There is going to be an interesting,
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:18.240]   and I'll be curious at WWDC to see what happens. But people have started to look at the source code
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:25.920]   of iOS 16's code named Sydney. Apparently, it's just loaded with references to mixed reality.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.440]   There have been a lot of rumors that Apple, of course, is going to do a mixed reality headset,
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.960]   something like the HoloLens Microsoft already does. There's no question they're going to do
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:42.400]   that. The question is, when will they announce it? They always frustrate us with how long they take,
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:47.120]   but they won't do it until it's really, really ready. I think, in general, I don't know when they're
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:53.760]   going to announce this thing, but I do believe that they will announce it before they ship it,
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:58.400]   like the iPhone. In fact, you've got to get developers developing for it. So the time to
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:04.320]   announce it, frankly, is this June. There are already references to a simulator. I think there's a
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:10.000]   two-digit percentage chance that they're actually going to announce this thing. Opening it up to
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.080]   developers. I think it's real possibility, and people can start building it on this simulator.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:21.920]   Somewhere between 10 and 99% chance. Yeah, exactly. Probably 10. Let's go with the 10.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:24.800]   Two digits is kind of a wide. I've been burned so many times.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:30.560]   Mark German points out that because it's in iOS 16, lots of references
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:36.160]   that will probably launch during the lifecycle of iOS 16. Doesn't mean it'll come out in the fall
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:42.400]   when iOS 16 does, but it will sometime between fall 2022 and fall 2023. That seems reasonable.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:47.120]   Right. And weren't the rumors that this first version, so there's supposed to be three stages,
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:52.000]   I believe, where this first version is going to be like a $3,000 headset kind of...
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.480]   Developer model. More living room-based. Yeah. Yeah. And it'll probably come out for developers
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.640]   first, and then I don't know if it'll come out, you know, regular for consumers. The next stage
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:05.760]   is the one that people really want, but that's until 2024 or 2025, which is...
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.800]   This idea of like Apple glasses. The idea you just put on glasses and you use it,
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:16.560]   you use it as your iPhone and your Apple watches, you know, the actual computer connection to it.
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:20.960]   And you just walk around the world, right? And you see augmented reality, it gives you information,
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:25.680]   notifications and all this kind of stuff. I think that's really the dream here.
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.120]   I'm really curious about what Apple's going to bring to the table in terms of augmented reality
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.480]   and virtual reality in the living room that hasn't already been done. That's so unique.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.760]   Because I'm still... I feel what their second generation's idea of like glasses is what people
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.400]   really want, but we're still seeing pretty far off from it. Although North, you know,
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.440]   what North Folkles was doing some cool stuff in this area before Google got bought. I thought
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.000]   those were great. Yeah. But then they're gone. But Google owns them now. But I can answer that
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.760]   question. So first of all, you talk about the regular glasses that are actual augmented reality
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:04.640]   where you're seeing through glass, you see the real world through glass rather than the first
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.840]   version, which will essentially be VR that they use for AR, where you're looking at video of the
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.600]   real world. That's the first version. But the... And there's no way the glass version is going to
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:19.680]   be out in 2024. That is the plan. You're correct that that's what the intention is.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:23.760]   That's what the rumors are. But I don't believe there's any way in how they're going to be out with
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:32.640]   that version in two years. There's no way. But here's their... What I believe their killer app is.
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:39.520]   They call it Bionic Virtual Meeting Room. Basically, it's a way to have social interaction and it's a way
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:49.920]   to do business meetings through AR. So basically holographic Memoji where you can do the eye contact,
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:58.560]   you can. You hear the rich audio. So if Leo is a hologram sitting there, I would turn and hear
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:04.320]   his voice coming from this direction. I could make eye contact with his hologram. I think that's
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:08.880]   really the killer app that they've been working on. They did an acquisition. I don't recall the name
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:16.160]   of the company. And two, three years ago, and they have dozens of patents around this Bionic Virtual
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:22.880]   Meeting Room idea. So that's their idea for a killer app for their AR in the short term.
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:25.840]   And I think it's actually... I think they're onto something. I think that's gonna be...
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:32.720]   It's like solve the hybrid workforce. And zoom fatigue. That whole thing. All that Brady bunch,
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:36.320]   wall, old people. But come on, wearing that headset for hours at a time.
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:43.840]   But this is the difference between the Zuckerverse, as I call it, and Apple's version.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:48.240]   The Zuckerverse idea is, "Oh, we're gonna just get up in the morning and put on headset and
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:52.480]   live in the metaverse all day." There's no way that's gonna happen. Apple says, "No, we're gonna
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:57.280]   be living in the real world, but every once in a while, we'll put on the goggles for a 45-minute
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:03.280]   meeting." That is the right version of what is gonna happen. And it'll certainly be more like
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:11.040]   being in person. Yes, exactly. You'll see your actual environment and then holographic humans
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:17.120]   will come. Apple's not the only one doing this. There are dozens of companies working on this idea,
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:20.720]   but they've got some really good technology. And they're the ones who will mainstream it, I believe.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:25.120]   What's your prognosis for HoloLens, Daniel? It's unclear what Microsoft's
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:30.480]   long-term goal with that. Yeah. Well, I was gonna also mention Microsoft Mesh is the same concept
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:35.600]   of having a virtual meeting space that they work with all space. And they've kind of combined
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:41.120]   these technologies. Well, this idea, it's interesting if Apple has like, it makes sense, right? If they
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:46.320]   have a video capability to do a video stream of your real environment and then do what Microsoft
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.600]   was calling Holo portation a couple of years ago, where you bring people into your environment.
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:59.280]   To answer your question about HoloLens, yeah, the insider did a real bang-up job of reporting
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:05.440]   on the inside happenings of the HoloLens team and mixed realities team there. And it seems chaotic
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:10.240]   and I'm really kind of worried about what's going on there. It sounds like they were working HoloLens
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:15.040]   3, which was going to be again more of an enterprise device was going to have newer technology. But
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.800]   then he got this massive government contract and they started devoting a lot of their resources
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:25.440]   towards that. The military, the army was going to buy a hundred or still is going to buy a hundred
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:32.400]   thousand Holo lenses, although Microsoft's been downplaying and the army's not happy.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:36.800]   Well, Microsoft even warned, you know, soldiers aren't going to like this at first. You just got
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:43.040]   to bear with us. But the technology, yeah, it's not up to what they were saying that they promised
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:48.880]   they could deliver. And what about the rumors that they are planning to partner with Samsung on?
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:53.440]   Right. And so that was a separate rumor that was later kind of confirmed by insider saying that,
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:07:00.560]   yeah, they're partnering with Samsung to develop some sort of mixed reality or augmented reality
[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:05.840]   glasses or heads at, which I think makes a lot of sense for Samsung because Samsung wants more
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:10.720]   than anything to compete with Apple. And Samsung can't do it all. So they rely a lot of times on
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:16.080]   Microsoft. You see Samsung going also big on PC and computers these days. And with those PC
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.360]   computers, they're using those extensions for their Galaxy phones to mimic the ecosystem,
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:25.760]   the tight ecosystem that Apple has. So in fact, this is the only phone that really works well with
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:32.080]   your phone. Now my phone on Windows 11 is the Samsung phone, but it works flawlessly. It works
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:37.840]   beautifully with it. Yeah. Well, I mean, the only difference with the what your phone or what's now
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:42.160]   called link to Windows is the, I think we're going to call it my Philly to stream apps.
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:47.200]   They're not going to call my phone. No, no, it's can be called. Somebody's link to Windows. Okay.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:52.400]   Yeah. But the idea is you pair it to your phone. You have it on your phone and you can see the phone.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:57.520]   You can see an image of your phone's screen on your on your Windows screen. You can share apps.
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:04.320]   It's like, yeah, get notifications on your. Yeah. So it just does like app streaming. And then the
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:08.560]   Samsung version allows you to launch individual Android apps like their little windowed apps.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:12.880]   That's the main difference. And you have copy paste. But for anyone who has an Android phone,
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:18.400]   Android 7.0 or higher, you can do things like do your phone calls, do your photos,
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:23.600]   do SMS. So you're getting an integrated base. Basically, it's a little extra. That's parody
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:28.880]   to what Apple's got with its iPhones. Yes. Right. Right. So, but with Samsung. So the question,
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:33.120]   of course, is, all right. So it's like a make the hardware. They've got the screens.
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:37.680]   They seem like they'd be a great hardware partner and Microsoft the software partner, right?
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:42.880]   Right. Because Samsung has mass global production. They actually know how to make this stuff.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:49.200]   What do they also make? Right. They make the LCD screens used and a lot of VR type headsets.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:55.680]   They own their own audio company, AKG. They own, they make their own processors. Right. So they
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:00.720]   do a full stack, basically. But Microsoft also has all the technical know-how they learn from
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:04.800]   HoloLens and holographic computing, as well as the software. But the question is, is this going
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:11.200]   to run on Android? What's happening to all the stuff that Microsoft has been building out for the
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:16.560]   last seven, eight years with holographic mixed reality on the Windows platform,
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:21.440]   which doesn't sound like it has much of a path forward. We don't know what that is.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:26.240]   HoloLens 3 reportedly got canceled. The government contract is now problematic,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.560]   apparently. It's having issues. And now you have the Samsung strategy, which is like,
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:35.120]   seems like it'll really benefit Samsung. But I don't see how it benefits Microsoft long-term.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:40.400]   If they want to do this idea of mixed reality for Windows. So, and then on top of that,
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:45.520]   we have a lot of employees who are absolutely unhappy about this, which is why they had 20
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:52.320]   people for that article for Insider that were not on the record, but off the record, who are
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:57.200]   either a former employees. Like, that's a lot of people. Is that the military thing there?
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:01.040]   Unhappy with the defense contract? That's what they don't want? No, I think that a lot of the
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:09.200]   people were unhappy because they hired a guy from Microsoft from Apple and his goal, and he just
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:12.720]   wanted to build a consumer version of HoloLens. There was this question,
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:18.880]   "When are we going to get that?" Apparently, he was brought over to do that. And that's not
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.600]   really happening at this point. So, the teams aren't happy because there's no sense of direction.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.480]   It's chaotic. And these projects that have been breaking off on are kind of failing and not doing
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:34.560]   well. So, I don't know. It really sounds like typical Microsoft. It's pretty rocky. But if you
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:43.120]   look at the mesh presentations, it really required a HoloLens. I mean, they show somebody using
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:49.920]   an Oculus, I guess, something like an Oculus, or maybe an HTC Vive. But honestly, without the
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:57.600]   hardware HoloLens part, does any of this make sense? Meanwhile, majorly... You can do the VR part.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:03.840]   Yeah, you could do VR with it. So, you can use regular VR headsets, and it'll still be fine. But
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:09.680]   HoloLens would give you the ability to do environments. Yeah. Yeah. This is the...
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:14.320]   Oh, it is fantastic tech. And you know where the majority of this VR stuff is going to end up?
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:20.240]   On the yellow and black site that shall remain nameless, that way too many dudes spend too much
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.600]   time on. I'm trying to think what it is. Yellow and black. Don't think me. Just let it go.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:32.640]   The audience knows what it is. I feel like I'm left in the cold out in the cold. I don't even know
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.680]   what you're talking about. You got it, and so that was good enough.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:41.040]   Okay. Oh, I get it. Something adult. Is that what you're saying?
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:42.640]   Yeah, it requires less close.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.160]   Less close. We're all the internet.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.520]   That's what it always is.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.200]   If you've been to Second Life lately, I can't believe what's happened to Second Life.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:52.880]   Quick thing about Magic Leap, though. They came out with the second version, and they have two
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:12:01.920]   features that I think are really killer. So, when we talk about consumer versus enterprise,
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.560]   we all want a consumer thing. We think about a consumer thing, but actually, enterprise is where
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.040]   AR is really going to blast off this high-end AR that HoloLens is going to do
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:16.560]   for quite a while. Then, the consumer stuff will blow up many years in the future.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:22.080]   You have Apple, who's going to have this big consumer thing, but also enterprise. It'll seem
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:27.920]   consumer, but it'll be valuable for enterprise. Magic Leap 2 is going to have a killer enterprise
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:33.680]   product for two reasons. One is they're going full open source. They're using Android
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.040]   open source and for development.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.120]   It's so like because I've written Magic Leap off completely.
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.560]   No, yeah. Well, it's still around.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:46.800]   They've almost died a couple of times, but their new versionist is really great. So,
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:53.200]   lots of companies, universities, enterprises will be able to very quickly create their own
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:58.000]   special purpose applications, which is why, in fact, it's going to blow up on enterprise first,
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.880]   because you only need one or two applications for specific enterprise usages, whether it's in the
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:09.840]   factory or for drivers, whatever. The other one that I think is really brilliant is they have this
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:19.520]   kind of dark mode for their glasses, where let's say you're outside and you have this holographic
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:24.560]   projection that you need to do useful work with, you can't see it because it's like too bright.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:30.000]   So, they have this thing that will darken the screen and make it almost like VR. So, they basically
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:37.360]   darken the actual environment while giving you this bright holographic data or image or whatever
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.640]   that you can interact with. And that is a really great feature for enterprise applications,
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.080]   because now you can be in a bright factory, you can be in a boardroom, you can be outside,
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.320]   you can be in lots of these environments, and you're not doing VR, you're doing AR,
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:56.640]   and it's highly visible. So, I actually don't think we should be writing off Magic Leap. In fact,
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.200]   I think they're doing far, far better and have a bigger chance than Microsoft does in this space.
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:07.040]   My own personal opinion, but I think this is a video of the Magic Leap 2, which is not yet
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:13.520]   out. But doesn't look frankly as spooky and insectoid as Magic Leap 1 did.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:17.600]   It's much better. Magic Leap 1 had the same problem Hallens had, which was
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:22.880]   it's just this narrow slot of VR. So, they're broadened AR. So, that's bigger.
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:29.600]   It's field of vision. The jury's really out on this whole mixed reality thing.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:36.720]   Regular reality is hard enough. I know. I love the premise, and I feel like I can see the vision.
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:43.200]   Maybe it's just very hard to do. Well, it's hard to do it. It's expensive, and the batteries are
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:48.400]   an issue. How do you put processing power into a headset? Do you have a thing that's on your belt?
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:56.560]   I think that the killer combination is, I think Apple is in a good position,
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.240]   so they can connect it to an iPhone, which can be the super-feeder that powers it.
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:06.880]   Then what they can do is they can use, I believe that Apple's going to heavily use QR codes. So,
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:12.480]   QR codes can give you the data that you want to present in AR and also the location.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.880]   We all walk around a little QR code on our foreign thing. No, no. You put a QR code on a bottle,
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:21.520]   or on a table, or something like that. And the thing hovers over the QR code, but it also
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.960]   tells you what to go or sign on a restaurant window, or you can put QR codes anywhere,
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:34.640]   and that can be the location for... I'm talking 1.0 usage for the mass public.
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:39.520]   In the future, they've all... The problem is anchoring it to physical reality. How do you do that?
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:47.680]   And that's a lot of what the... What HoloLens is so good at. You can have a virtual object that
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.320]   not only stands on the table, but actually gets behind the table. How do you do that? It's really,
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:58.240]   really hard. So, I think QR codes can solve that in the short term in a more cost-effective way.
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:04.400]   And of course, Apple has all kinds of really unique Apple-specific QR code-type technology
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:11.120]   that they've worked on. So, I really think it's going to seem like this whole category is going to go
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:15.920]   in nowhere until Apple hits us with their version. And then suddenly, it's game on,
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:22.000]   because they're going to mainstream it. It's early days. I think that's what Microsoft's
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:28.080]   struggling with HoloLens is. It's not quite delivering. And they've just got... No one knows
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:33.920]   what to do with it. Outside of an enterprise, you can do... You can do specific applications,
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.840]   they're using it in medical schools. But when it comes to the consumer space, it's like,
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:44.400]   what is that killer app? AR, VR, VR at least at home, it's gaming. That's gaming and social
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.120]   has been kind of the two main driving factors for VR. But how do you now... There's still something
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:52.960]   so isolating about it. If you have a family and you're like, "All right, I'm putting on my VR,
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:57.200]   hell, I'm letting you." You're just basically cutting yourself off from the rest of society,
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.240]   the rest of people around you. But when you go to AR and this idea of you're just wearing glasses
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:06.800]   and it's just giving you augmented realities, giving you information about the world around you,
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:10.720]   that kind of change things. So you were doing a thing that I've been waiting for?
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:15.920]   Sorry, brother. One thing that I've been waiting for. Okay, so you're wearing this shirt right now,
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:23.040]   and it's a cool shirt. I would love to walk into the men's habit, Dachery, and I try on that shirt.
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:30.640]   That shirt has the near field communication to the mirror, because it comes in sick colors.
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:34.880]   Right? You know what we do now? We try on all six. I would love to just put on one.
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:38.960]   But stand in front of the mirror and then swipe the mirror. Okay, let me see it in blue. All right,
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.880]   that works. Let me see it in red. Yep. Okay, I'll take all three of those. And that kind of stuff
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:53.360]   is how we get it into the normal people's face where it works. Even for a car, I've been dying to
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:18:02.080]   get like micro, you know, LED paint job, because I got a great card today. But you know, my favorite
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.960]   one, a purple car. Right, my favorite team is playing. I want a rock Manchester United colors.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.960]   I just want to hit a button. It's Manchester now. Is that black and yellow? Is that the
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:16.160]   black and yellow you were talking about? That's that's ready. It's ready. Go. But you know,
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:24.640]   it's that old that I was that game called the original PlayStation GT5. Gran Turismo. Okay,
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:29.760]   Gran Turismo like it'd be super cool for stuff like that. And I think when we can figure that stuff
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:35.760]   out where it's actually semi functional and not just the gaming side, that's what's coming. And yes,
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:41.920]   I do believe in painting. E ink paint is coming. I actually know some material scientists here
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.480]   at a university that are working on stuff like that. So nice. That's the stuff that's going to be
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:51.360]   quite amazing. So yes, yeah, Mercedes, you're doing self healing paint and then
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:55.360]   eating for color for color. You're going to need self healing paint if you've got a ink paint.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:00.240]   You're going to need some something pretty powerful to heal that one up. Actually,
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:05.920]   you know where they may find use for this, you just made me think of this in retail. There is a
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:12.160]   massive problem right now in retail. I think partly due to the pandemic, a Nash, this is from the
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:19.840]   CNBC, a national retail federation survey found that more re-mercen merchandise was returned to
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:31.600]   retailers in 2021 than the entire US military budget. $761 billion of merchandise returned.
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:36.560]   Amazon, we don't know how much, but Amazon's got a big portion of that.
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:42.000]   Returns are way up year over year. And I think that's because people don't go to the store
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:49.200]   and try on five colors of Daniel's shirt. They order all five. They try them on. Keep one,
[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:54.960]   send five back for back. And I am on prime prime wardrobe is right? Yeah,
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:59.760]   that's a thing where you leave you purposely ordered that. And that's it's set up to do exactly
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:03.200]   that. You're supposed to return it. You don't want to do that. I mean,
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:08.240]   huge cause to the problem. Yeah, you do that. I'm part of the problem. You do that. Because
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:13.760]   I'm I'm stitch fix. There you go. I love this fix because I hate going to the mall. But
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:18.560]   get different t-shirts from stitch fix. I didn't realize that there. They're sending,
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:22.480]   they're sending you stuff. You pick what you want. They send it back. Right. But I swear,
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:27.120]   just literally two, three days ago, I saw something on YouTube. I think it was business
[02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:33.600]   insider again, you know how algorithm works where they're showing you this mountain in in Africa.
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:41.920]   Huge problem. They call it fast retail clothes, you know, the H&M's and the stores like that. I
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:45.760]   can't, I don't go to the mall. I can't remember the polls. But yeah,
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:49.760]   colds. Yeah, that kind of stuff, big lots. It all ends up in this place. These women,
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:54.400]   they sell it in the bizarre there in secondary market. Alex probably knows this down to the
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:21:00.640]   detail grind it up in the argan oil. I think it ends up into these giant mountains of clothes on
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:07.360]   the beach and it was so sad and disgusting 16.6% of all merchandise sold during the holiday season.
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:16.720]   16.6 was returned. The average return rate for online 21%. US returns generate 16 million metric
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:23.200]   tons of carbon emissions because they've got to be shipped back and 5.8 billion pounds of landfill
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:30.960]   every year. Maybe we do need VR just so that we could try shirts on. Amazon has said
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:38.480]   tells CNBC, we don't send stuff to landfills. We do get this energy recovery. You know what energy
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:46.960]   recovery is? Landfills burn it. Burn it. Oh, God. Wow. Burn it. We burn it. Oh, that's better.
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:50.560]   Anyway, for the environment. Yeah. All right.
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:55.920]   Amazon also does a thing. It's actually very convenient but contributes to this where you buy,
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:02.640]   you get something sent to you, decide you don't like it and you can bring it back to a local store
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:06.400]   and just return it there. You don't need to send it back to them.
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:13.040]   Still a return. Yeah. A lot of times that store then gives you a credit or a coupon
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:17.120]   and then gets you your shop in that store, which I've actually used numerous times. It's been pretty
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:24.640]   brilliant. I think maybe there's a time coming in this world where we stop trading convenience
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:29.680]   for climate. I mean, I don't know if you saw the latest UN report. We are in bad.
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:36.800]   Yep. Shae. We've only got about a 10-year window left to change things. There's a great
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:43.040]   editorial in the LA Times, which I took to heart. The only thing we should be talking about right
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:50.800]   now is the climate crisis because the time has come. We are in deep, deep water.
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:23:00.240]   So anyway, cure up. Well, it's almost over. It'll all be over soon. It's all going to be over soon.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:03.520]   But I think the kinds of things that we're doing like trading convenience.
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:09.280]   Oh, yeah, it's really convenient, but it's destroying the environment is not a good thing.
[02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:16.000]   One thing I loved about that article is that they really pile on to the language we use.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.680]   So we say climate change, which sounds innocuous and natural. And we really should call it something
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:26.000]   like the human extinction crisis. It's an extinction event. We need a better
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.520]   language. We should call it global warming or anything that sounds pleasant. We should call it
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:40.800]   the generational once in a human lifetime crisis that's about to kill us all. We need to boost
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:46.080]   the language so that when we talk about it, we understand that this is really, really urgent.
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:56.080]   Sy. Let's take a little break because I can't do anything about climate change right now.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:03.360]   I'm going to cancel my stitch fix. I'll get right on that. Yeah, I don't know.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:09.760]   We actually more and more are getting more and more sponsors that are all about reducing plastic
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:14.320]   use and stuff. I stopped shaving with one of those five blade plastic razors and I use the
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:20.400]   old fashioned single blade that is metal and I recycle it and I don't buy another handle every
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.840]   week and all that stuff. And just trying to do more, you know, trying to here in California,
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:31.520]   we're now starting to compost. I know it's a huge reduction in the amount of recycling we do because
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:37.680]   it's a lot of its compost now. But we just got to do more. And the truth is, as much as we do as
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.720]   individuals and I have electric car and all of our cars are electric and we have solar panels
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:48.320]   generating all the electricity they use in our house uses, but no individual can change the world.
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:51.280]   We got to all do it. We got to all do it. The government's have to go.
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.880]   Then also it's still to also in industry too, right? Because absolutely. It's really like the
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:02.480]   consumers always get blamed for it. And then the industry comes up with ways to set the argument,
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:05.280]   right? We're going to give you here's the old school way for people who love it.
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.120]   Never mind the new people who tried to do wah wah wah. And for the wah wah wah people,
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.440]   here's another thing that costs even more than a traditional one because you want to be a good
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:21.040]   human being. That thing right there, it drives me baddie. There's no way that certain foods
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:25.840]   without all the unnecessary things that are harmful for you should cost more and no way
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.240]   that you get away with lying on packages about stuff that's healthy for you. That's actually not.
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:35.360]   Like those two things got to go away right away. The real problem is that we've pulled
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:40.000]   trillions of dollars of oil out of the ground. Right. We have this massive infrastructure
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000]   investment trillions and trillions of dollars and those companies are not willing to abandon
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.560]   their investment. They're not willing to abandon that trillion dollars worth of oil they've already
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:55.360]   pulled out of the ground. But if we burn it all, it's too late. There will be nothing left,
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:01.600]   billions will die. But you know what, I don't want to, I already pulled it out of the ground.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.720]   We got to use it. And plastic is a petroleum product and it's cheap because it's such a nightmare.
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.680]   Yeah, so such a nightmare. And we have a great sponsor, Blue Land, which I'll give a free plug to,
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:18.320]   which's all about not reusing, single use plastic, not wasting all those. If I could advise people
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:24.880]   about how to think about this in the most simple way, don't lean too hard on recycling. Recycling
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.760]   is good. You should do it. But that's not a solution. Don't just apply plastic willy and lily
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:35.440]   and say, well, I can't say recycling plastic. No, the only the only good plastic is one that
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.480]   you never buy or use. And the only good, the only environmentally friendly smartphone, for example,
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:45.040]   back to tech is the one that's never manufactured. Because once you manufacture a smartphone,
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.720]   you have toxic chemicals, you have all this stuff, you have all these problems.
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:54.720]   So we should be embracing, I fix it, we should embracing repairability and reusability. And
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:27:02.160]   everybody should embrace the idea of using laptops and phones and tablets and everything,
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:07.920]   milking them in getting every bit of life out of them one way or the other as we can to reduce
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:13.680]   the manufacture of new devices. Because that's really what's going to help the tech industry
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:16.160]   do a better job with the environment. - Right on.
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.620]   - Yeah. - Take a little break
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:19.700]   to sell something. (laughs)
[02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:24.280]   That will not use any environmental research.
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:27.200]   And then we'll be back with some final thoughts
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:28.600]   from our fabulous panel.
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:30.520]   Doc Rock is in the house.

[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:33.460]   - Hello.
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:34.280]   - Hot, hot, hot, hot.
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:35.120]   - Hi. - Hello.
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:36.860]   - Hello, hello, hello, hohar!

[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:31.480]   But you wanna make sure it's something they enjoy doing,
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:33.280]   'cause if they enjoy doing it, they'll do it.
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:34.840]   They'll get more value out of it.
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:36.880]   I should tell you, IT Pro TV,
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:39.080]   more than 80% of users who start a video
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:41.560]   actually finish it 'cause it's engaging.
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.840]   It's informative.
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:44.480]   They get what they want out of it.
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:45.680]   It's not painful.
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:47.520]   It's all divided up into small chunks,
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:50.160]   20 to 30 minutes, so you can watch it at a lunch break
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:51.160]   or at a quick break.
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:52.480]   It's fascinating.
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:53.760]   It's fun.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:55.200]   And it's fresh.
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:56.800]   That's really important.
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:59.480]   Tech industry is constantly changing.
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.120]   And you need to be trained in the latest software releases,
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:04.800]   the latest system upgrades, latest cyber threats.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.760]   IT Pro TV has seven studios running Monday through Friday
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:11.080]   all day, so they have brand new content all the time.
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:13.640]   Content goes from the studios to their library
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:15.160]   in 24 hours.
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:17.840]   Right now they're up to 5,800 hours worth
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.360]   of fascinating, informative, useful content
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:24.720]   ranging from technical skills to compliance
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:26.760]   to even soft skills to business skills.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:29.200]   Microsoft, Cisco, Linux, Apple,
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:32.200]   security, cloud, every vendor, every skill,
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:33.520]   all in one place.
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:35.600]   And the dashboard for business is great.
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:37.440]   You can track your team's results,
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:40.000]   easy to manage your teams, make assignments
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000]   even to the individuals or subsets of teams.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.200]   You can have full courses or just assign individual episodes
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:48.000]   because all the episodes have full transcripts
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.680]   you give and say, I want you to watch the minute 15
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:52.800]   and minute 17, you need to learn this.
[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:53.960]   And the reporting is great.
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:55.920]   You'll get all sorts of insight into your team's viewing
[02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:58.240]   patterns, what progress they're making.
[02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:00.360]   You'll know that you're getting the return on investment
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:02.720]   with IT Pro TV.
[02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:03.680]   They'll love it.
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:06.120]   You'll love it and you'll have a smarter team.
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:08.240]   And everybody wins.
[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:11.080]   Give your IT team the development platform.
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:13.040]   They need to level up their skills
[02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:16.480]   while enjoying the journey for teams from 2 to 1,000.
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:20.080]   And by the way, volume discounts start as low as five seats.
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:21.840]   Plus, if you mention,
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:26.840]   TWIT 30, TWIT 30 to your account executive at IT Pro TV,
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:30.480]   you'll get 30% off or more on a business plan.
[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:31.640]   So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:36.640]   ITPro.tv/twit, ITPro.tv/twit
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:39.680]   and don't forget that offer code.
[02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:41.720]   Say, TWIT 30.
[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:43.120]   And that way we get credit
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:46.040]   and you get a nice 30% discount.
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:49.800]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:51.880]   Had a great week this week on TWIT.
[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:53.520]   We've made a nice little video for you.
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.720]   Enjoy this at your leisure.
[02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:57.320]   - Okay, so on this episode,
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.320]   we are proving that when and flow
[02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:01.040]   are not the same person.
[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:02.920]   Just 'cause the sky is different people
[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.760]   because they're never on the same signs.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.080]   - There were some concerns.
[02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:09.600]   - Look at our backgrounds when you reverse them.
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:11.600]   They're kind of the same.
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:14.480]   - Previously on TWIT.
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:15.720]   All about Android.
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:18.440]   - Flow actually goes hands on with four devices,
[02:31:18.440 --> 02:31:21.520]   the OnePlus 10 Pro, the Motorola Edge Plus,
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:26.320]   the Xiaomi 12 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy 853.
[02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:27.520]   - This week in Google.
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:30.480]   - Street photography, it's a new book
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:32.600]   of street photography, but it's not a people.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:35.320]   It's of the screens of their smartphones.
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:36.520]   These are great photos.
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:37.400]   - Great photos. - And it's fascinating.
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:38.240]   - Yes.
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:40.200]   - And I think it's a total invasion of privacy,
[02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:43.600]   but you can get the book, it's #NYC from Jeff Mormelstein.
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:44.800]   - Tech News Weekly.
[02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:47.400]   It's a subreddit called Place.
[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:48.360]   It's just so cool.
[02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:51.320]   The idea is that any user, any Reddit user,
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:55.680]   can post one single pixel, or they call it a tile.
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:57.400]   After that pixel is placed,
[02:31:57.400 --> 02:32:00.240]   I must then wait five minutes before I can place another.
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:04.040]   So what this does is it requires collaboration with others
[02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:06.480]   in order to actually create something meaningful.
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:07.320]   - To it.
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:08.960]   - Tech or just like you like it.
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:13.280]   - To have a massive battle over the Canadian flag or whatever.
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:15.080]   Or to just waste a lot of time.
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:17.000]   - Slash our slash places, fascinating.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.280]   It's over. - So cool.
[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:21.920]   - It's over, but boy, some of the battles.
[02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:23.880]   And I don't know what the Germans were,
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:26.000]   they had the flag just went all the way across.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.280]   I mean, they were very organized.
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:30.320]   - Somebody built a building, then it would catch on fire,
[02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:31.160]   then a fire truck would come in.
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:32.160]   - That was hysterical, wasn't it?
[02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.480]   - Yes.
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:34.840]   That was an amazing one.
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:36.120]   How did they organize that?
[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:39.160]   - Gamers, I guess.
[02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:41.520]   - I was gonna say the Among Us guy,
[02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:46.520]   they kept drawing human parts on the Among Us person.
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:48.760]   And they would get a race and they kept coming back.
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:52.440]   And it was just like, this is a good use of people's time.
[02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:56.280]   - It's been voided out.
[02:32:56.280 --> 02:33:00.480]   So you're not gonna be able to add to it anymore,
[02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:02.280]   but this is the final art place.
[02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:05.840]   I've seen people get giant prints of it.
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:08.920]   There's Zelensky, there's a lot of Ukrainian stuff
[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:10.960]   in here.
[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:13.120]   Do they have the, oh yeah, we can watch the timeline.
[02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:14.280]   It's 82 minutes long.
[02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:16.360]   I don't know if I wanna go through the whole thing.
[02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:20.640]   You can also zoom in, but pretty impressive.
[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:22.720]   Pretty impressive what they did.
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:24.080]   I love Reddit, I'm sorry.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:26.800]   - I live on Reddit now.
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:29.240]   I don't contribute, I just breathe.
[02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:30.760]   - Oh, there are Chelsea in there.
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:34.840]   - Well, we should get Man United, wait a minute.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:37.720]   You Man United fans, you gotta get involved.
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:41.360]   - We're too busy crying from a crappy season.
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:45.680]   - All right, so this is the void when it started.
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:48.000]   Here we can scroll through it
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.560]   and you can see it building, it's pretty amazing.
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:54.360]   I don't know if it's gonna stay up forever.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:57.360]   I think they pretty much shut this down after a while.
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.920]   /r/placeunreadit.com.
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:03.600]   You can see stuff happening, there's the German flag.
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:08.000]   It's kinda wild, kinda wild.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:08.840]   - Incredible.
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:10.160]   - Yep, the hive mind.
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:11.560]   - It is the hive.
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:17.720]   Let's see, we're not gonna get to a tenth of the stories
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:21.880]   I had planned for you, I'm sorry to say.
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:26.640]   Drones are dropping ice cream in Texas.
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:29.280]   Alphabet's winged drones, they're being used
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:33.000]   to deliver stuff primarily from Walgreens,
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.960]   but also Blue Bell Creameries.
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.480]   The video of it, it looks like it's on a fishing line,
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:43.160]   it drops down, the kid runs out, picks it up.
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.920]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:47.960]   It seems so inefficient, doesn't it?
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:52.960]   It's like every tech demo ever, it's like what?
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.920]   What?
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.720]   Windows 3.1, now you, we talk about how VR,
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:03.560]   it's in its infancy, Windows 3.1,
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:06.600]   which is the first decent Windows 30 years ago,
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:07.600]   that's all.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:08.760]   That's all.
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:10.600]   You both are big Windows guys, Mike,
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:12.440]   you were probably covering it.
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:16.360]   That was the version that really sent Windows Magazine
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:18.040]   at the time into the stratosphere.
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:21.320]   I remember the first issue that we published,
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.600]   we were going on and on about how huge Windows was,
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:30.600]   it had four million users and three million copies
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:33.600]   in the first three months, but Windows 1 was terrible,
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:37.480]   Windows 2 was terrible, even Windows 3 was pretty awful.
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:41.000]   I remember vividly, what was this, 30 years ago,
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.320]   so 92, looking at 3.1 going, uh oh.
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:48.320]   Yeah, this is actually gonna happen, this is good.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:50.880]   Oh man, this is almost a good voice too.
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:53.400]   It was Windows for work groups, right?
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:56.120]   Yeah, that was 3.1, 1, 3.1, 1.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:59.440]   3.1, 1, that's where I made my money.
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:02.520]   Like back then, I used to do so much networking
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:05.200]   and get an office set up and yeah,
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.640]   Windows for work groups was fantastic.
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:10.520]   Happy birthday, Microsoft also celebrating,
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:15.520]   it was formed April 4th to 1975, I think.
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:17.600]   So it's 47. - 47, yeah.
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:20.600]   - 47. - It's just a middle-aged company.
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:21.440]   Yes.
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:24.880]   Let's see, what else?
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:30.960]   Did you, anybody watch Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV?
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:34.080]   Oh, yes, but that's not the thing.
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:37.240]   The thing is the big, Tracy pitch thing.
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:38.720]   The pitch thing.
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.240]   They weren't using it on the NAS game that I was watching.
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:44.400]   That's weird, it's on your, it's a,
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:46.880]   so the problem has been for years, signal stealing.
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:47.720]   Yeah.
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:49.040]   Right, you'll have somebody out in the outfield
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:51.760]   with a camera beaming it back to the dugout
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.040]   so that the batter can know that it's gonna be
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:56.320]   a fastball high and tight and he can hit it.
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:00.440]   So this is a technology to avoid pitch stealing.
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:03.440]   You've got a little calculator that's big
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:06.040]   on the catcher's wrist and a little earpiece
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:08.920]   to the pitcher and the catcher goes,
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:11.960]   "I noticed a lot of teams are not yet using it."
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:13.200]   How do you do that with the glove?
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.400]   Do you have the whole glove?
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:16.840]   Oh, that's a good question.
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:17.680]   I don't know.
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:19.440]   That's what had me kind of,
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:21.440]   so it's on the gloved hand, right?
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:24.480]   So your other hand is free hand.
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:27.320]   But there's a little bone conductor
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:30.320]   that goes into the back of the pitcher's new era
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:31.960]   and it goes slider.
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:32.800]   Like what?
[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:33.640]   What?
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:35.240]   The slider or cutter?
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:38.200]   Because the only way, okay, here's why this is dumb.
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:39.880]   Here's how we defeat this.
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.960]   All right, so you got out there, you're set up, right?
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:43.480]   Yankee's dude is on the mound.
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.040]   We're at Fenway and he's punching away,
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.120]   trying to ask for a slider and all we do in Fenway
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:50.520]   is just make noise.
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:51.640]   He can't hear nothing.
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:52.480]   Niner.
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:54.280]   (laughing)
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.360]   You like to wear a slider or a cutter?
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:57.200]   Niner!
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:00.480]   And you bring that cutter in and it just gets
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.840]   the freakin' green monster and Andy and Naco
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:05.200]   and Doc Rock's tear.
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:06.040]   Yay!
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:07.680]   Like, I don't know, it's funny,
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:10.520]   but I get where they're going, but yo, it's so far.
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:11.360]   Here's the device.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:12.200]   And it's huge.
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:13.040]   It's huge.
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:15.360]   It's a big, you think they could make this a little better.
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:17.520]   This seems pretty, it's like a black,
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:19.480]   maybe like a black leftover blackberries.
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:20.800]   Yeah.
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.620]   And the pitchers say it sounds,
[02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:27.920]   Metz reliever, Adam, Adavino said,
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:30.720]   "You don't even notice it, it just sort of whispers to you."
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:31.560]   It's like--
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:32.400]   He plays for the Mets.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.480]   He keeps asking.
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:35.600]   I'm sorry, Mets fans.
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:38.480]   I'm sorry, I'm from New York, but I'm not a Mets fan.
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:40.640]   I'm not a Yankees fan either, I'm a Red Sox fan.
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.480]   Yeah, Red Sox, yeah.
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:44.440]   Anyway, okay.
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:47.240]   No races on to crack it.
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:48.080]   Oh, I bet.
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:48.920]   That's the greatest.
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:50.800]   You know, I hope it's encrypted.
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:54.520]   Do any one of those pitchers can hand this to their 15-year-old
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.000]   and like, "Dad, here's how you do it."
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.560]   Yeah, probably.
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:38:59.880]   Also, they're gonna put cameras on the wrist
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:01.480]   so you can see what buttons are.
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:03.080]   (laughing)
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:03.920]   Yeah.
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:04.920]   You know, that's all you do.
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:07.840]   You zoom on on the wrist and to the fingers.
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:08.880]   Yeah, it's silly.
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.120]   It was a good track, baseball.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:12.200]   Yeah.
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.040]   You know what?
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:16.640]   They are working really hard to try to get,
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:19.720]   this is funny because I love baseball.
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:20.880]   I think Leo, you two--
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:22.040]   I do, yeah.
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:26.560]   One of the things, they lost their star power a while ago
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:28.440]   and they haven't really been able to put it back.
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:31.720]   The last of the stars are A-Rod and Poppy,
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:33.080]   who cares what you think about them.
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:34.760]   They're just not really in the game.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.120]   Like, if you went to--
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:39.200]   You say that 'cause you're a Red Sox fan, I know that.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:40.440]   No, I said A-Rod.
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:42.320]   I said A-Rod, I'll give him his props.
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:45.880]   Right now, the biggest star is probably Judd,
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.320]   but like, you know, a lot of, I mean, judge, sorry.
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:50.160]   But like--
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:51.240]   No, they don't have the star power.
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:54.240]   The Mike Trout's like, no, it's not the same anymore.
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:55.080]   Right?
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:57.120]   I don't know anybody who's the most wicked player,
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:39:59.360]   I see Red Sox fan, who's the most wicked player
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:01.120]   in baseball right now, they can't even tell you.
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:01.960]   Yeah.
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:02.800]   Like, that's what--
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:03.560]   I feel like it's probably--
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:05.800]   It's too slow for the modern times.
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:07.560]   It's probably a dying sport, but--
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.400]   I love baseball.
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:09.080]   I do too.
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.720]   And I have to say, Apple TV did not do baseball justice
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:16.120]   on Friday with their two games.
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:18.320]   They're trying new graphics, which I liked.
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:21.520]   It's awesome in 4K, but turn the sound off.
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:24.120]   Because I don't know who these guys are doing the play-by-play,
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:25.960]   but--
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:27.520]   Yeah, go get some better--
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.360]   Get some people.
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:30.040]   --first thought to get some better--
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:31.800]   Or let us do it.
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:32.160]   Yeah.
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:32.680]   If you--
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:33.680]   There you go.
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:36.440]   --the first football, basketball, baseball executive
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:37.720]   listened to us.
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:41.840]   Back in the day, when Fox had soccer, Fox Soccer Nation,
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:43.240]   they used to do a thing on Mondays,
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:44.680]   where they would play a game and just
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:47.120]   let two fans from opposing teams go as--
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:50.120]   so it'd be a Manchester game versus Arsenal.
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:52.240]   And you had a group of fans that got randomly picked,
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:54.280]   and the group of fans from the Arsenal got randomly picked.
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:57.720]   And we did the play-by-play, that it was hilarious.
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:58.440]   It was fun.
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:00.040]   Everybody would tune in.
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:03.560]   The chat back then was on some special chat app,
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:05.560]   which now we have all this stuff, right?
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:12.400]   So do a sports broadcast on Apple TV, where you let fans come in.
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:14.400]   And maybe there's a panel of 10 from each side.
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:16.760]   You're randomly picked, and it would be just glorious.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:18.160]   That would be interesting.
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:19.680]   Oh, I'll watch that.
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:20.680]   Or maybe.
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:23.480]   Maybe they need the podcast feature, where you can watch baseball
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:25.840]   at 1.5 speed.
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:27.760]   You know, that might solve it.
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:28.200]   To the--
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:29.320]   To that would solve it.
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:30.440]   To the Benny Hill theme.
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:31.280]   Yeah, to the--
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:32.280]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.960]   You know how they recently tri-miked?
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:36.400]   When I was at my tech conference,
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.040]   normally on every other weekend, I had baby said my niece.
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:42.440]   And she was her night to come over, but I was out of town.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:44.120]   So she came over anyway.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.840]   And then we watched--
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:47.360]   what is it?
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:48.880]   Ryan Rindel's movie.
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:52.200]   We watched it over the Apple Share Play stuff.
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:52.840]   The Adam Project.
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:55.320]   And it was great.
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:56.080]   It was super good.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:57.000]   I'm in my hotel.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:57.800]   I'm in my hotel in Shenandoah.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:58.800]   That's really cute.
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:41:59.320]   Yeah.
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:01.240]   They're here in Hawaii, and we watch it together.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.600]   It was fantastic.
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:03.200]   That's nice.
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.000]   So I like that.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.560]   Here's a good use of technology by an old form of technology.
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.440]   Amtrak set up a Twitch stream.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:17.000]   This is the train station in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.160]   Amtrak wants to open a passenger service
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:24.080]   to trains a day between Mobile, Alabama, and Nolens.
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:28.320]   But the freight train lines that own the track say no,
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.640]   because we're using it for freight trains.
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.120]   So Amtrak set up a Twitch stream of this track
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:39.160]   so you could watch it and see how dead it was.
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:40.320]   It really isn't fair.
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.680]   The freight train companies say, well, of course,
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:45.440]   we do eight trains a day on that track.
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:47.400]   You're not going to see it all the time.
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.360]   It's going to be kind of slow.
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:52.240]   Eight to 10 through trains, one to three colon grain trains
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:54.320]   and numerous local trains.
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:57.320]   CSX says Amtrak wants to run two round trips a day.
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:42:58.640]   That's four trains.
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:00.880]   But the problem is these freight trains are so long.
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:02.920]   You have to have big sightings for them.
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:04.520]   Because it's a single track, as you can see.
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:09.560]   There's only one train at a time and one in both directions.
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:11.360]   But I thought it was interesting that--
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:13.560]   let's see if the Twitch stream is up right now.
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:17.160]   Amtrak Connect Us is offline.
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:19.080]   But you can watch a popular--
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:20.960]   you can watch a popular clip.
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:24.080]   Let's do that right now.
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:25.920]   This is one of the better clips.
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:26.720]   This is good.
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.080]   This one.
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:30.000]   I'm glad they saved this one.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.200]   Oh, the class moved.
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:34.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.560]   Look, there's a squirrel.
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:37.720]   I'm going to leave this up for all of you
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:41.640]   want to stay tuned and watch the rest of the evening.
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:44.000]   Amtrak station Mississippi.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.600]   Not very busy.
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:47.680]   Kind of slow right now.
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:49.760]   And a lot of happening.
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:50.520]   Oh, that was it.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:51.840]   That was the whole clip.
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:52.960]   That's over.
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:53.960]   Sorry.
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:54.720]   Just loop it.
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:57.000]   Because you know, I think it's going to change.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.520]   Hey, I'm glad Kevin came at your son.
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:01.680]   I really want to give a big plug.
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:05.600]   Hello, chatterbox.com.
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:08.000]   This is a great choice for any school
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:14.000]   that wants to get kids up to date on AI, on smart speakers,
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.200]   without invading their privacy.
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:19.560]   They build it themselves.
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:23.160]   And now that you guys have Raspberry Pies in stock,
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:25.960]   how much is a chatterbox?
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.040]   Without the Raspberry Pi, it's 149.
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:29.400]   149.
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:31.160]   Provide your own Raspberry Pi.
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:34.960]   And it has a very simple chatter blocks language, which
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:37.240]   is a customized version of Google Blocky.
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:40.120]   So the kids are coding the skills themselves.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:43.880]   It does not listen to you until you hit the button.
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:45.640]   So no intrusion.
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:49.280]   But a really great idea for STEM literacy in the schools.
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:51.920]   And one issue with education is that the teachers
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:54.360]   feel like, oh, I'm not a technologist.
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:57.360]   How do I teach technology to the kids?
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:59.200]   And chatterbox solves that problem
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:03.320]   because basically it's very simple for teachers to teach it.
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:05.200]   They don't have to be technological.
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.120]   They don't have to be developers or programmers
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:08.320]   or engineers or anything.
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:10.320]   They can just be regular teachers.
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:13.400]   And the curriculum takes them through the process
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:15.080]   of doing everything on chatterbox.
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:17.440]   And so the kids learn without the teachers
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:20.480]   having to be a PhD in computer science or whatever.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:23.880]   And I remember this learning programming.
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:25.760]   What we did is 10.
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:27.880]   Hi, Leo, go to 10.
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:31.320]   But having the computer actually do something anything
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:34.400]   because you wrote a program for it to do it is amazing.
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:36.440]   And you can write a program for it to do square roots
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:37.920]   and not know a thing about square roots.
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:40.720]   And it does it on demand.
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:44.320]   That feels pretty damn good for a 5/5th grader or 6th grader.
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:45.240]   That's exciting.
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.240]   And with access to APIs into Wolfram Alpha and all
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:50.160]   these other weather services and everything,
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.040]   you can just build the most powerful, like genuinely
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:55.440]   powerful things with it very simply.
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.360]   And this blows away teachers and students--
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:02.680]   I went with Kevin Tinney and Apple to this big technology
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:04.040]   education event.
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:07.720]   And everyone's blown away by the power of it
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:09.280]   and the flexibility of it.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:15.320]   And it's just an amazing product that will help kids.
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:17.240]   This is the kind of thing that we would have
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:19.320]   if we had the kind of sputnik energy that--
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:21.080]   remember when sputnik happened?
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:24.600]   And the US decided to really do a big push into science
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:27.840]   and engineering and mathematics and technology.
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:30.120]   And much of the technology that we have today
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:32.240]   as a result of that, this is the kind of thing
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:35.320]   they would embrace now if they had a clue about getting kids
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:37.280]   really prepared for the future.
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:40.680]   Do any individual parents buy them for their kids or some?
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:43.440]   Yeah, it's available, but we really focus
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:45.280]   for impact driven.
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:47.120]   It's mostly you want to get in classes and stuff.
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:48.120]   Yeah.
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:49.120]   Getting school.
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:50.120]   But I could spoil it.
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:52.440]   Looking for these solutions, especially with the pandemic.
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:52.960]   Yeah.
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:54.760]   I wouldn't buy one just for my niece tonight.
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:55.080]   I know.
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:56.240]   Wouldn't it be cool?
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:56.720]   Yeah.
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:59.000]   I just feel like you'd have so much fun doing it together
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:00.040]   and all that.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:00.560]   Yeah.
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:01.840]   Hello, chatterbox.com.
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:03.240]   I always like to give Kevin a big plug.
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:04.800]   And of course, as long as we're plugging
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:08.960]   gastronomad.net, what's the next with Prosecco?
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:11.840]   Well, Prosecco Barcelona, Morocco are all sold out.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:13.440]   So this year--
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:15.400]   That's partly--
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:17.040]   I mean, it sounds really good, but you only
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:18.160]   take a few couples.
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:20.120]   It's not like there's a big group of people.
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:22.680]   We do small intimate groups for Prosecco.
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.240]   We're doing, I think, eight to 10 people.
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:28.080]   But I would really encourage people
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:30.320]   to embrace our Provence experience.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:33.520]   This is in the summer during the peak of lavender season.
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:34.360]   Nice.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.120]   And Amir doesn't let me give away anything.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:38.760]   I can't tell you anything about it.
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:39.840]   You should not because you--
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:41.240]   It's a surprise.
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:42.280]   That's the whole point of it.
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:44.920]   But Mexico City and Oaxaca are also
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:46.320]   have availability.
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:48.760]   And those are wonderful experiences.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:50.520]   Well, you did Oaxaca.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:51.160]   Love Oaxaca.
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:52.840]   Speaking of Oaxaca, today's Pam's birthday,
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:54.360]   she asked me and she did Morocco.
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:54.880]   Happy birthday, Pam.
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:57.680]   She said, hey, I told her I was doing twins.
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:58.800]   She's like, hey, that's my birthday.
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:47:59.560]   Give me a shout out.
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:00.600]   So happy birthday, Pam.
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:02.080]   We had lots of fun with her in London.
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:03.480]   Yeah, she's just great.
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:06.480]   But the gastronome experiences, if you're unfamiliar
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:10.160]   with what we do, is that these are based on the places
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:12.280]   that we have lived extensively.
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:15.840]   And so Amir has deep relationships
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.240]   with winemakers, with food visionaries of all kinds.
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:21.840]   And we take people around to meet them
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:25.400]   and to experience things in a way that no tourists ever could.
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:26.760]   So--
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:27.600]   I'll vouch for that.
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:28.960]   It was amazing.
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:30.000]   And if you're a club twit member,
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.200]   there's a great conversation with Mike and America
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:33.800]   that I did last month.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:34.560]   That was a lot of fun.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:35.320]   Twit plus feed.
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:36.040]   That was really fun.
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:36.520]   That too.
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:37.760]   Get a better idea of all of this.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:39.320]   Highly recommended.
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:43.600]   Mr. Daniel Ribino, it's such a pleasure having you on the show.
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:44.360]   It's been a while.
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.560]   I'm glad you're back with your fancy camera
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.800]   and your superb bokeh.
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:50.760]   Unbelievable.
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:51.960]   Really, look how good that looks.
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:52.560]   Doesn't that look good?
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:53.160]   Amazing.
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:55.160]   Executive editor, Windows Central.
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:57.720]   Plug something.
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:02.640]   I've got the podcast every Friday, 1.30 PM on our YouTube
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:03.800]   channel at Windows Central.
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:05.800]   And we've got a bunch of content there.
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:10.160]   But yeah, the net follow me on Twitter and at Windows Central.
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:11.800]   All right, post pretty regularly.
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.800]   Absolutely, Windows Central dot com.
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:18.480]   What's the name of the podcast?
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:19.680]   Just the Windows Central podcast.
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:21.320]   OK, so if I search for that, I should--
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:22.600]   We also have a gaming.
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:23.440]   People aren't a gaming.
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:26.480]   We do have an Xbox 2 podcast.
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:27.560]   So we'll be listening to that.
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:29.400]   Gaming is very huge now, Windows Central.
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:30.960]   But gaming is massive.
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:35.400]   I finally got an Xbox Series X a couple of weeks ago, thanks to--
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:36.040]   Yep, there.
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:36.560]   Anthony.
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:37.520]   --Sully coming back in stock.
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:40.200]   Yeah, yeah, so I'm all excited about that.
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:41.440]   Nice.
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:42.800]   Windows Central, thank you, Daniel.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:44.600]   It's great to see you.
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:48.720]   Thank you so much, Doc, Rock, the doctor of rock and roll.
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:52.120]   He's a community manager at E-Cam, which is great software
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:53.400]   everybody should use.
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:58.280]   You could follow him on his YouTube channel, youtube.com/docrock.
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:01.120]   What do you talk about on Doc Rock Channel?
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.520]   Trying to teach people who are getting into becoming
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:06.760]   content creators to get out there and start doing it,
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:08.960]   because I believe that when we share our stories
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.400]   and we tell--
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.640]   sort of what Mike and his family is doing.
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:14.080]   When you get people to tell their stories,
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:17.000]   you help pick other people up.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:18.000]   Just like today, right?
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:18.600]   We're out here.
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:20.400]   We're talking tech, we're having a good time.
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:22.320]   And then somebody comes in from UK
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:24.320]   and lets us know they're OK, we all feel better, right?
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:25.960]   That simple story is like that.
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:27.160]   Ken just changed your life.
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:28.960]   And so now I'm trying to teach people
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:32.520]   how to get into content creating as a way of,
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.440]   I guess, letting more people in the world
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:36.120]   to see other people in the world.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:38.920]   So then you understand that everybody's just people.
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:40.840]   I am such a big believer in that.
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:41.400]   Yep.
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:42.280]   You know what I mean?
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:45.000]   I think if the more we know about an outside world,
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.600]   the better we can behave as all people in this process.
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:50.600]   So as a traveler like Mike, I think
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:52.480]   that's what started me on my mission.
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:54.680]   And yeah, that's what that's so true.
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:58.080]   Yeah, Doc's one of the great people in the world.
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:59.120]   And there's actually a picture of him
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.320]   with that his hat on the side.
[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:01.080]   I can't believe it.
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:03.560]   What?
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:05.400]   Never seen him without his hat.
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:06.080]   Here, OK.
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:07.080]   No, no, no.
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:07.560]   No, no, no.
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:08.560]   I was--
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:11.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:14.080]   Do you use argan oil on the head as well as the beard?
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:16.080]   Nothing comes out of that headache, so he--
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:19.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:22.120]   It looks like a bad lawn when he's growing in a couple of playing
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:22.640]   spots.
[02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:24.080]   And yeah.
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:24.960]   No, you look good.
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:28.720]   And it is really always a pleasure to have all three of you.
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:30.600]   Three great friends on the show.
[02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:33.120]   Thank you to Daniel and Doc and Mike.
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:36.120]   And thanks to all of you who tune in and watch--
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:40.360]   you can't actually watch us do this live at live.twit.tv.
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:42.160]   It's usually about 2.30 p.m.
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:43.600]   on a Sunday afternoon.
[02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:48.200]   That's Pacific time, 5.30 Eastern, 21.30 UTC.
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:50.960]   There's live audio and video at live.twit.tv.
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:54.560]   If you're watching live, our IRC channels heat up
[02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:55.800]   during the live shows.
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:52:00.400]   So it's a good time to visit irc.twit.tv to join the fun.
[02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:03.720]   We also have a Discord channel for the club Twit members.
[02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:06.160]   After the fact on demand versions of every show we do
[02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:12.320]   are available at our website, twit.tv, including, I might
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:16.320]   add, that YouTube channel where you can watch every show.
[02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:18.080]   There's audio and video.
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:18.880]   Best way to watch.
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:22.520]   So probably find a podcast client, whatever suits your interests,
[02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:24.280]   whatever speed you like to listen,
[02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:26.600]   you can subscribe and get it automatically.
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:28.200]   The minute it's available.
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:30.160]   If your podcast client allows for reviews,
[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:32.400]   please leave us a five-star review.
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:37.080]   After 17 years, there's some people forgotten we exist.
[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:38.680]   So let them know.
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:40.720]   We're still standing.
[02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:43.000]   Rust never sleeps.
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.640]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:48.040]   And as I have said, for 17 years-- actually, 16 years
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:51.480]   and 51 weeks, another Twit is in the can.
[02:52:51.480 --> 02:52:53.200]   We'll see you next week for our anniversary show.
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:54.200]   Bye-bye.
[02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:56.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:52:57.200]   Do the Twit.
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:58.200]   Do the Twit.
[02:52:58.200 --> 02:52:59.200]   All right.
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:00.200]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:01.200]   Do the Twit.
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:02.200]   All right.
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:04.200]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:05.200]   Do the Twit.
[02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:05.960]   Fun.
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:07.160]   This was a good way to celebrate.
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:07.680]   Yes.
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:08.680]   Excellent.
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:10.560]   Oh, Leo, somebody just reminded me.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:12.880]   And I'm so bummed that I forgot.
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:15.760]   I wanted to send some happy thoughts out to Justine.
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:17.160]   Oh, oh.
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:18.720]   Let's do that right now.
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:22.080]   So I did not know my wife leaned over.
[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:25.760]   She said, Justine was in the hospital for five days.
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:28.360]   What happened, Doc Rock?
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:32.080]   She has a rare condition.
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:34.280]   The word is too fancy for me to remember.
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:36.120]   But yes, she just got sick.
[02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:38.400]   And then coming to find out she has some rare condition
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:40.640]   that's going to require some maintenance
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.760]   throughout the rest of her time.
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:43.080]   Oh, we love Justine.
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:43.880]   Check her out.
[02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:45.360]   Her ID-- you know her.
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:46.760]   She wouldn't tell everybody what
[02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:47.760]   is going on.
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:48.440]   Yeah.
[02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:50.040]   And yeah, it was a blood clot.
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:50.680]   That's what it is.
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:53.480]   Thank you, PCI.
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:55.680]   The 808 messed me up because I went, oh, Hawaii.
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:53:56.000]   But then it's--
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.440]   They call it a Padgett Schroeder syndrome.
[02:53:58.440 --> 02:53:59.000]   That's the one.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:53:59.840]   Padgett Schroeder.
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:02.240]   I was thinking the weird thing--
[02:54:02.240 --> 02:54:03.760]   Yeah, Padgett, I know.
[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:09.160]   The weird thing is she might have to have a rib removed,
[02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:10.920]   which is bizarre.
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:13.320]   But anyway, Justine, we all love you.
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:15.120]   And we hope you're feeling well.
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:18.000]   I'm glad you're getting good medical care.
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.000]   And yeah, she's on Instagram and talking about it at iJustine.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.000]   So yes, iJustine has been a friend of the network
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.440]   for almost 17 years.
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:31.320]   And we wish her all the best.
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:32.000]   Get well soon.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:33.880]   We love you, Justine.
[02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:34.600]   Very good.
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:37.160]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:37.680]   It's weird.
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:40.200]   Did she talk about how you get it or where it comes from?
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:41.480]   I don't know.
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:43.560]   I just happen to be looking at the chat
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:46.520]   and then Keith 512 reminded me.
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:48.440]   And I was like, oh, yeah, I meant to do that anyway.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:50.000]   Because yeah.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.760]   I was talking to some people the other day.
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:55.640]   And I got to go shoot with Sydney,
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:57.640]   D'Young's, I'm where I was in San Diego.
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:00.000]   And as you know, he works with his sister.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.440]   So him and Jenna do some stuff together.
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:06.240]   So it's a trip that our spaces were small, right?
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:08.760]   Even though I think people watching us assume
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:11.640]   our spaces is really big because we do all the podcasting
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:13.560]   and blogging and they're all over the place.
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:14.720]   But our space is really small.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:18.240]   So we end up running in relatively tight circles.
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:19.240]   You know what I mean?
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:22.960]   So like just hearing that she was sick and is just like,
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:26.760]   oh no, like that's somebody that we literally watched grow.
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:27.880]   Well, she's so young.
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:29.920]   She shouldn't be sick.
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:32.360]   You know, it's just sad that an old guy like me
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:36.160]   is perfectly healthy and she's in the hospital is not right.
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:38.960]   So I'm volunteering to take your place.
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:41.400]   She was in the hospital for five days.
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:44.320]   The blood clot in her shoulder, I'm glad they caught it,
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:46.600]   traveled to her lungs.
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:49.480]   And she may have to have a rib removed for some reason.
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:50.600]   I'm not sure why that would be.
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:53.720]   So get well, I guess she's home.
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:56.480]   But boy, that's scary.
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:57.280]   That's scary.
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:57.880]   It's crazy.
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:01.200]   She had a sore shoulder for several days.
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:02.240]   Didn't do anything about it.
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:04.120]   But then it got so bad she couldn't raise her arm.
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.120]   So she went to a local hospital.
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:08.640]   Thank goodness they saw something going on.
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:12.800]   They wanted no more and sent her to a larger hospital.
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.160]   The clot is still not cleared according to our chat room.
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:19.520]   Sounds like some positive thoughts.
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:20.480]   Send her some of the low-huh.
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:21.480]   I hope she gets big.
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:22.360]   Yeah.
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:22.840]   Yeah.
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:25.080]   She's a great person.
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:26.360]   All right, thank you guys.
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:28.000]   Have a great evening.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.160]   Have kept you long enough.
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:32.280]   Good God knows.
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:33.040]   Good to see you guys.
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:34.920]   We're going to hold out for three hours.
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:36.600]   But it's to be easy on you.
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:38.440]   Have a great one, Daniel.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:40.480]   Hello. Like I do. Take care. Take care.
