[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:22.200]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 58 for June 18th, 2006.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.200]   Hello everybody, we are at Yahoo! Today, which is kind of Yahoo! Kind of an interesting
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:49.080]   thing to be. This is podcast Academy 3.K of IT Conversations, who is part of our Twit
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.800]   panel today, has done this now three times, kind of an education and podcasting, and
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.200]   asked us to be part of the podcast Academy. So this is the real world example. This is
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.920]   it. This is what not to do. Let me introduce the panel, starting with KIT Conversations.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.600]   I think he's really the pod father, one of the longest running podcasters, even before
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.960]   anybody called it podcasting, and then he now does dozens of podcasts every single week
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   at the IT Conversations channel, ITconversations.com, and the Conversations Network, and podcast
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.000]   academies too, which is really great. That's right. Good to have you.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.800]   Another Twit is with us, Mr. Chris Tobona, who is a part of the Twit Network, a great
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   part of the Twit family. He does the Floss Weekly, which is our open source podcast. He
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.840]   is the program, open source program manager at Google. That's me.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.640]   And we brought you in here just to talk about Microsoft today. No, I'm just kidding.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.880]   It's good to have you. It's great to have you. Molly Wood, the Malefluis Molly Wood, of course,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.800]   you know her well from buzz.cnet.com. And now starting this week, CNET TV, which is launched
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.320]   big. We'll talk about that as well. It's always great to have you. Thanks for having
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.680]   me. She's the only person who actually covers the news. And so we rely on her for facts.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.560]   Yeah. That's a high bar, actually. I'm not sure.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.400]   And the rest of us are going, you know, Cannon's getting out of the camera business. We leave
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.920]   it to Molly. What is that one time? Oh, familiar story.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.280]   I had to hear 56 to know that one. Yes. We won't go into that. And of course, my good
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.000]   friend, the Sledgehammer wielding Patrick Norton, who has lost all his hair in a tragic accident
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   with a barber clipper. We call it aging, actually. Great to have you.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.360]   Should we call him the hammer? The hammer. You know, I should do that, you know, that
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.320]   kind of McLaughlin group style thing where you're. It's perfect for Hamilton. Molly
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.360]   Malefluiz would. I don't know what I'm going to call you.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.960]   I want to say Chris, the boner, the boner. Did they, did they in high school? No, no,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   no, no, grade school. The first school. Yeah.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.280]   No, you make a decision really early on with a name like mine. If you're going to get into
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.200]   a lot of fights or if you're just going to laugh, just going to live with it. And it's
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.920]   not such a third grade I started living with. That's such a bad thing to be called.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.120]   There's worse. Doug. Okay. Now let's get to the story.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.400]   As my banker relative said, it's okay to okay. Sorry. Sorry I had to do that.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.920]   Oh, man. That's too many homonyms for me. Let's talk about the first story, the big
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.480]   story. There really is only one story. This week, Bill Gates stepping down at Microsoft.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.400]   He says in two years he's not going to be in charge of Marshall State Chairman of the
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.360]   board, but he's already handed Ray Aussie the keys to the car saying you're now the
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.920]   chief software architect. Good news, bad news. The market said the market's holding its
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.600]   breath on VISTAs release. I think more than anything else. Well, and Microsoft lost something
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.280]   like that 25% in April. So it was already depressed stock to begin with.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.900]   I think judging from I'd looked up the stock price earlier and judging from aftermarket
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.160]   and today it's after hours trading and today it's like dead even. Yeah, like no change,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   which is probably what all opponents say. I mean, it could be good. It could be bad.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.160]   And it's not like he's everybody's like, he's retiring and it's like he's becoming
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.840]   the chairman of the board, right? It's not like he, you know, everybody who controls
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.880]   Microsoft has been hired by him and selected by him and groomed by him. You know what
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.680]   I mean? He's still going to be and, you know, he's still going to be a phone call away.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.400]   You can still maybe there's going to be less of the 4 a.m. emails with Bill Gates being
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.480]   like, you're an idiot. Why did you choose a spouse with a development course on this?
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.600]   I think it's more important than that. I think Microsoft employees go there because of Bill
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   Gates. He is an icon and I think that he is an important leader. What are you laughing
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.480]   at, Mr. Obama? This is like, they used to go there for Bill Gates. Now they go to Google
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.560]   for that reason, right? No, no, no, no. And I'm not here to be all Mr. Competitive. No,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.280]   but it's no. I don't think that when you have a company as large and as expansive as
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   Microsoft is that people go there for the chairman anymore. I think they go there because
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.000]   there's a project they're like the Xbox. Yeah, but symbolically, Bill leaving the company
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.640]   is significant. I mean, it's not like Steve Jobs leaving Apple. That would actually, the
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.320]   whole thing would be implode. Yeah. So, and it isn't like that. Yeah, like it imploded
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.800]   last time when he left. Well, it did. Well, sort of. It took a few years. It came within
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.840]   inches of dying. Well, in fact, it's true. But it's like, you know, but by the time they
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.680]   walked in, I mean, how many people have been walking to a company and affect the change
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.320]   he did? The only reason he could affect that kind of changes is because they were nearly
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.160]   dead, right? Well, it actually was says, of course, was this kind of loyal to Gilamellio
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   that in fact, Gil made all the changes that Jobs implode. You know, Jobs is the president
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.240]   who came in and actually reaped the benefit of the previous president kind of story. You
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.360]   picked blue in a funny shape and it just happened to me. I just, I think this isn't
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.080]   an argument about jobs. This is about Gates. At some point, the job had to go to somebody.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.600]   Right. So, the question is, did they pick the right guy? Right. I'm optimistic. I think
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.440]   they picked probably the best guy they could. Right. The question is, is it a net improvement
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.880]   or not? Frankly, I have, I give it good chance. I think it explains why Ray Aussie went there
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.200]   in the first place. I couldn't figure it out. That's, you know, that's a good point. Yeah.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.240]   I said, why, why would he do that? Yeah. The first, the first most of us heard of Ray Aussie
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.800]   or at least people became more aware of him when the big memo came out about how they
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.040]   were going to, you know, get into live basically. And who wrote that memo? And take on Google
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.960]   and it came from Ray Aussie and people are going, Ray who now? Right. And all of a sudden,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.520]   then, you know, a year later, however long later you hear that this is the guy that's
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.800]   taken over for Gates and it makes a lot more sense. Is there respect for Ray Aussie in
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   the programming community? Sure. He created a lot of notes, right?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.680]   It's a very storied engineering. Yeah. And I wondered, you know, why is this guy who's
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.800]   accomplished so much going into this kind of corporate hierarchy? But you know, you must
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.080]   have been, I would like to be the lion's den. I think, I think that there was a dinner.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   And I think Bill said, you know, you know, I'm not going to stay here much longer. I'm
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.360]   looking for a successor and I have, I am going to invite you. What was for dessert? See
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.400]   Balmer's head on a platter. I think after that, really? Yeah. So is this good or bad
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   for Microsoft? Yeah. Yeah. I like, I agree with the stock market. I think you make a
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.400]   case that's good for them. I think you make a case that's good for Microsoft. I think
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.080]   look what Microsoft has not been doing very well in the last year. I think there have
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.120]   been a lot of stumbles. I think maybe it's time for new leadership.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.160]   You know, part of the question, I guess you hinted at it is what is his acceptance, not
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   so much by new hires, but by the people who are there. You know, the people look to him
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.840]   as being the legitimate successor to Gates on an internal basis. Will they take technical
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.720]   direction from him? Can he set the priorities for how they should deal with security? I
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.760]   don't know. That's a big issue to be seen.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.200]   Yeah. And how involved was Gates day to day? I mean, does anybody have a sense for that
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   at this point?
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.240]   He changed the toilet paper and everything. I think he was fairly involved.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.160]   I think he was fairly involved. Because in some ways it's just evolutionary, right? No
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.840]   one stays there forever. He's obviously not going to stay there forever. He's got the
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.360]   most bulletproof exit strategy in the world. I'm going to go help the children. There's
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.600]   no hint that he is jumping off the sinking ship. There's no hint that he is getting
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.320]   pushed out in any way. And so it may be that it's not going to change things that much
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.600]   because it doesn't seem like a very revolutionary departure.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.200]   I mean, it's certainly benefit to the world. I mean, he's got 30 billion dollars that he's
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.040]   going to give. And he always said, I'm not going to start giving away my money until
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.240]   I can pay attention to what I'm doing. It's a full-time job.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.920]   But not paying attention to they've already managed to stomp out a couple of diseases.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   They've done a lot of things.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.160]   They think what will happen when he actually starts paying attention.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.000]   Yeah. They've done okay. So I guess our vote is it doesn't really matter. It's a big enough
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.360]   company now that there is no one person that's critical to us.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.920]   I'm refusing myself from this particular one.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   You can win.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.760]   You can use Google. Yeah, maybe we should ask you if it's good for Google.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.960]   Clearly, oh, I don't speak for Google. So it's clearly very interesting though. I am
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.600]   actually more interested in the foundation angle, though. I have to admit.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   Oh, I think it's exciting.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.120]   They just got started on malaria and they could make a very real difference there. So
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.480]   yeah, I mean, that's a very big disease to fight. You know, I'm because, you know,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.240]   sleeping sickness is gone. The river blindness is gone because of what Carter did. It's like
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   maybe you could do malaria.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   It's pretty good to be incredible.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240]   Only people, you're dying from that thing.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   I know.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.200]   Yeah. Google did launch a Shakespeare site. I don't know if that's it.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Cool.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   I like that.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   It's so incredible.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   Shakespeare site.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.960]   I think it's going to get something they couldn't get sued over.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.240]   Actually, just this one.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.640]   Just to be fair, because last week we talked about Microsoft's Windows Genuine Advantage
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.480]   snooping on people and Microsoft did it immediately, by the way.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.520]   No, let's not review 57.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.320]   I'm reviewing it because Google's now being accused of something similar.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   What's the thing?
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.400]   That they're going to sort of try to track people's online TV watching.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   What's that?
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   Oh, that was interesting.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.600]   And then sort of them targeted at, yeah, it's just research.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.160]   But then everybody panicked.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.800]   Yeah, I guess somebody in our research lab published a paper that said that, "Oh, we
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.600]   could listen to the TV and tell you what you're watching."
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.720]   Can you imagine deploying such a thing what you'd have to do?
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   All the time.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   Share.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   Software.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   I don't know.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   I think someone's going to have to do it, though.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   It's interesting because everybody freaked out about privacy, privacy.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   It's called ratings.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   But at the same time, everybody wants ads to be better.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   Right.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   And the way that you make ads better is to make them more targeted, make them more relevant.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   Certainly.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   I want to know what's going on.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.800]   I want to know if there's a cool product out there for me, but the way that I'm going
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   to be able to find out is to have somebody, unfortunately, watch what I'm watching.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.720]   Well, but it's also, it's like televisions are really strange medium to try to observe,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   right?
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   And then you're going to have to be able to find out what's going on.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   And then you're figuring out how do you target the X family, right?
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   So you either need to figure out where the X family is.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.720]   What they're doing is, you know, and if you can co-late all of, like, if somebody's been
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   searching lately for minivans, you know, and you have the ability to target the advertising
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   that's rolled into the video stream, into their house, whether it's over cable or, you know,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   broadcast, obviously, isn't going to work, but if it's over cable, you know, then if you
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   know dad's been searching for minivans and you just hammer minivan ads at the family.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   You wouldn't have to snoop on somebody though to do that.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   You wouldn't even have to divulge what I'm watching if you had smart enough client software that
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   did it.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   So how do I target you and your desire to buy minivan?
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   Because the software on my TV watches what I do and then requests appropriate ads, right?
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   Right?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   It doesn't have to tell anybody else.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   See, that's me.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   The software on the TV is watching me.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   That officially qualifies as snoop.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   But as long as it doesn't tell anybody, you don't have to say Patrick watches this and this.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   You could just say, can you give me some Chevy truck ads?
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   Right.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   People like to see this.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   I think the first time you had a conversation with somebody that ran an ISP and you go like,
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   so you have access to all my email.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   You know exactly what I'm browsing.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   And then you get the, you know, you either got one of two things, you either got the evil
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.120]   smile or you got the, I think of myself as more of a benevolent overseer of the bits that
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.720]   run through my, you know, domain, right?
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   And then you basically realize, you're saying like, yes, I know everything you do online.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   Don't piss me off.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   We're all tell everyone you know.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   That's so bad though.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   I mean.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   But it's the fundamental nature of the Internet, right?
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   It's tracked and it's, you know, the bits are monitored.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   Yeah, but is that the Internet you want to be on?
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   Is that the Internet that people want to be on?
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   The one worst thing we've ever been on.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   It is the Internet we've been on for a decade.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   Some of us longer, right?
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   Well, I guess the question is what's the alternative to?
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   If the alternative is me being on an Internet that's constantly imparting with me with a random assortment of ads that get ever more intrusive and ever more.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   Punch the monkey.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   You know, yeah.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   If we're not willing to pay more for things and if we're not willing to, it's like this constant trade-off.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   That's the irony.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   There's nobody wants to pay for Internet content.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   Everybody wants it for free, but nobody wants to see ads.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Or if they do, they want them to be targeted ads, but we don't want people to invade our privacy.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   So we're difficult.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   If the ad's stuck, they're okay with the ads.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   I mean, and how do the ads not suck?
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   You know more about your users.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   Do you know how they can are?
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   Here we are.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   Here we are.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   A few years after AdSense launched.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   And it's one of the most amazing successes of all the advertising schemes on the Internet, right?
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   Who would have thought that it would work as well as does and get as little flack as it does?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   Well, it's starting to get flack.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   And more I think about it, the more flack I want to give it for a couple of things.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   I'm not looking at you, Chris.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Chris, you're speaking for me.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   I'm looking at Mountain View.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   I can't even have a bug for that.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   Right?
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   And actually, they just circulated a survey which I'm putting this in.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   Good.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   Good ad sense is Google's actually quite clever plan to put advertisements on web page and
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   they certainly monetize the web.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   But I think critics are starting to say a couple of things.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   First of all, I've noticed that the ads are not as well targeted as they ought to be.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   And you put the word blog in anything.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   You're going to get the same four ads over and over and over again.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   Second, and I think this is more to the point, Google's not forthcoming with what percentage
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   of the money that they're getting, they're sharing.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   And I have a feeling that that may be an inequitous relationship, but we will never know.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   Well, I think that the way we want to think about the relationship is is it worth the money
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   you're spending on your ads, right?
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   Right.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   So if you're getting the return of investment that you want, then you're in a happy place.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   True.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   And similarly, there's also the issue of Click fraud, which Google has also not been very helpful.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   Oh, we're very hard about this, but that's not my department.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   Again, I'm not talking to you.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   See now, you'll never get on the show again.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   And if we-- What is hard to call here about Apple and labor?
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   Yeah, we're getting there.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   I'm just doing all the Google stuff now.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   But it's not aimed at you really, Chris, because Shakespeare is fantastic.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   We got the sun that rides first on and kills the--
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   Actually, no, this is really good.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   This is a sick and pale.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   We have the most non-complicated moment on the panel for the rest of the podcast.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   Who likes Google Earth beta 4.0?
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   And all the hands go.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   You should.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   Chris and I just--
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   Available from Linux now.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   Yeah, we just did a podcast with Ryan Gordon, who's the porter who made it.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   They've made it possible on Linux.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   So what's new?
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   What did they change?
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   It's actually the interface has gotten some real nice improvements.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   The interface is amazing.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   It's so pretty now.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   They've got some map data that's down to like 10 centimeter per pixel.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.720]   It would have cost you, like I was saying to Molly, it would cost you like hundreds of thousands of dollars to get access to in any kind of volume.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   And now it says--
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   So is it the raw map data that's improved?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   Two?
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   That's all the same.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   All of the above.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   And yeah, the program itself is improved.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   I mean, it's all good little things have gotten better.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   Gotta go look at it.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   What is it?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   30% of the world's population, right?
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   Yeah, 30% of the world's population can see their house now.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   If they have internet access, 30% of the world's population can see their house now.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   If they have internet access, 30% of the world's population can see their house now.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   That's fine.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   Actually, them too.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   But I can still get computers.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   Well, you know, 6 billion people, the people who can actually get--
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   We're gonna get all the Google stories out of it.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   So those of you who are listening, what are you looking at that's causing Chris such trouble?
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   I'm looking at the new Googleplex on the Columbia River.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   Is it the dales as I say it?
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   The dales, I think.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.720]   Is there Portlander who can clarify this?
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   The dales.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   The dales.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   We used to get calls from there on the show and I'd never go.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   No, I'm not gonna--
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   No, no, no.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   It is an evil installation.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   I have no agenda here.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   25.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   So evil installations, what?
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   So Google's building a very large network operations center.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   Currently, the dales in this particular area is a really great area because the tech rates
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   are low, I think there's no state techs.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   And it just happens to be on the confluence of all these data pipes.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   It's really a great place for a network operations center.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   But it's EPA.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   What's that?
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   Audible power administration.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   Cheap power.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   Because you get it from the--
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   On the power period.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   Power, lots of it apparently.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   And they've been building this and everybody's been sworn to secrecy in the dales apparently.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   I don't know.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   This is John Markoff's story in the New York Times.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   It was a quite entertaining story.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   I'm sure it was.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   I mean, I did meet one guy who swears that Google is trying to build a hive mind.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   I should have done that while you were drinking.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   [laughter]
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   For Chris.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   [laughter]
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   That Google is trying to build the world's largest computer brain and actually create artificial
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   intelligence.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   And I don't know why you would want to do that if you didn't see Colossus the Forbin project.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   Yeah, but you know.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   How many people seem terminators?
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   I'd say, isn't that how it starts?
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.720]   Oh, that's a good sound.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   Well, imagine it hurting 450,000 Intel boxes is about the same as, you know, what's the
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   chance of making the--
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   Well, they're not running Windows, so.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   They are running--
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   They are running--
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   They are running--
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   They basically say it from a Terminator one to an old sort of knock-wring.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   Don't let Bulber know.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   Actually, it's from 6502 assembly, if I remember.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   [laughter]
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   It's a bunch of old Apple computers.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   Anyway, I mean, there's nothing to say about this.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   I just think it's kind of, in fact, a sensational headline that John Markoff put in the New York
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   Times, "Hiding in plain sight, Google seeks more power."
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   Well, Markoff's always been known in the tech community for being sort of a gentle reporter
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   of the truth.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   Well, and as it turns out--
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   Thank you for laughing.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   Yes, I know what you're saying.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   And as it turns out, the power they're talking about is the cheap power from the BPA, not world
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   domination.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   So, I've been involved in data center operations, and the cost of electricity has become a huge
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   part.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.720]   And a lot of the data centers that we built in the late '90s are going to have to be shut
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   down because the density of servers has gone up so much.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   The amount of power used to be so many watts per square foot of floor space in a data center,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   and those numbers are way out of whack now.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   So, the data centers we built 10 years ago are going to be decommissioned.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   If you have an AMD Athlon-based installation, I think for a standard late '90s data center,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   you end up using about a quarter of the square footage before it just--you stop growing.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   Because you just can't get enough power.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   You're taking enough power in air conditioning.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   Wow.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   And so, this is a pretty big line.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   I don't know what it is, but in terms of Google's expense thing, power is a real problem
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   for them.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   And as is true for all of the large hosting operations here in the valley.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   And just to make you happy--
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   No, no, that doesn't make me happy.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   That doesn't make me happy.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   And to make sure that nobody thinks because we're in Yahoo that we are going to soft pedal
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.720]   anybody, you probably saw in slash dot, according to reporters without borders.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   Or--
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   What the hell's soft?
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   I just like saying that.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   What did you say?
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   Talking about--I don't know.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   That's their real name is--
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   It's a real name.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   That's their real name.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   That, in fact, the worst censorship going on in searches in China is Yahoo.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   They did a study on six politically sensitive keywords, search on Yahoo dot cn 97% pro-baging
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   results compared to 83% on Google and 78% on MSN dot cn.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   It's also MSN makes no comment on--basically says they do no censorship yet, turns up,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   results similar or worse than organizations that openly admit that they censor.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   This is George Carlin, "Six Words You Can't Say Online."
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   Yeah, Tiananmen, Gong, Falun Gong.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   But, you know, I just think it's interesting that Google gets all the heat for this, but
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   if you actually do the research--
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   The numbers are--I'm not looking at you.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   I know.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   You don't have to defend Google.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   I'm an handsome role.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   We should have started this podcast with a list of things not to talk about.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   No, I think it's very interesting.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   In fact, China recently stopped blocking China at Google dot com.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   So, in fact, you can go to Google dot com and get unbiased search results.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   There are other ways to filter search results.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   Right.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   In fact, there are a lot of activists who are doing great work making sure that Chinese
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   activists can get it on an unrestricted internet.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   It's funny.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   I heard that, like, if you go to certain Western hotels, you get a regular connection.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   Oh, interesting.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   I thought you should get, like, you know, the Chinese connections.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   It makes you want to go to China and set up a Wi-Fi spot like underneath the dresser of one of those hotels.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   I always wondered, like, how big the routers have to be to handle all that traffic and process it in the matter they do.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   You know, I mean, that's...
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   It's a technical achievement of sorts.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   A little bit.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   That's a good point.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   It's something.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   There's a lot of surfers in China.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   I think it's very exciting.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   So, did you see the pictures of the sweatshop, the iPod sweatshop in China?
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   So, the iPod city...
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   I've heard about the story of iPod city.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   The Foxconn is the company that...one of the companies of manufacturers, iPods, they have...they're a Taiwanese company, but they have a big factory.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   200,000 workers in China, mainland China, 200,000 workers who not only work there, but sleep there.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.720]   They actually live there.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   And the story is that they're working 15-hour days, uncompensated for overtime.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   They're making something like $50 a month.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   And yet, it's so hard for us to judge this because the other side of the story is, according to some, that's more than they'd be making an agriculture.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   They're sending money home.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   So, I've got my evil beard on.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   So, let me give you the evil part of this.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   Is it better than living out in the hinterland?
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   Right.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   Starving it down.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   Right.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   Well, I don't know.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   I don't know.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   It comes up in your head, sometimes, when you read these stories.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   One of the points of this story is, and in fact, by the way, to their credit, Apple said, now, let's hope this isn't just PR.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   Apple said, we're going to investigate.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   We do want this to be--
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   So, that's going to be the big story at the Worldwide Developers Conference, is that we're going to triple the cost of iPods.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   Well, that's exactly right.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   Right.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   That's going to be--
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   Apple's getting the heat for this, right?
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   Everybody does it.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   But it may--
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   But it's not exactly right.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   It's like notebook, notebook, bag, your backpack, your clothing, the inside of your shirt, and tell me what's made in China.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   And then I want you to try to figure out what people are making.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   Well, I think it's appropriate.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   But, I mean, Apple, this is a big consumer product.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   The bulk of the cost of this product doesn't go, in fact, to manufacture parts.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   It goes to marketing.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   Why don't we know why?
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   But it works.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   But it's like the whole idea of the offshore manufacturing, part of the reason manufacturing moved out of the United States.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   It's too expensive.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   It's because to reduce costs.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   Right.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   How do you reduce costs?
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   You pay people less.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   You go to places where you don't have to deal with the environmental regulations.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   And guess what?
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   Things magically get less expensive to make.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   But there's an expensive to the backside of that.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   Yeah, this is a story about outsourcing, not about Apple.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   Enough bad news.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   Apple is-- there are two rumors about Apple.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   One that they're going to do an ultra lightweight portable.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   This is because they're apparently buying up these NAND flash memories in great quantities.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   Oh, you think it's not going to be hard drive based?
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   That's the rumor is they'll make a flash-based ultra affordable.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   Let's start a new rumor.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   They're buying them for the PDA cell phone that they're going to give you a Mac world in 2000.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   Well, here's a rumor that you can actually give some credit to because it comes from, coincidentally,
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   Han Hai, who is the president, the chairman of Foxconn, the company that makes the iPods.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   Right.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   He's got the Chinese labor power.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   The chairman of iPods.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Do a financial services search on Foxconn and see whether or not they just released a whole bunch of stock into the market.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   Well, what he said, actually, he's talking to the--
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   I think a shareholders meeting.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   I'm not sure exactly what he said that Apple is about to unveil a new iPod, next generation iPod.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   Apparently, we're making it.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   Touch-free.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   Touch-free.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   It's made from people.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   Touch-free.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   That's why I like green chips.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   The little green chips.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   Yeah, what is touch-free?
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   That's the bad.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   So it's going to be a voice control?
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   That's not a voice.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   I'll show you what touch-free is.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   I don't know.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   Look at this.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   You're touching the notebook, Leo.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Well, if I could throw it, if I were willing to throw it, we'd still make those sounds.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   Throw it to Chris.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   So this is going to be a great way to operate your iPod on the plane.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   I don't want to die.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   Yeah, you know, this would be good when I get in the--
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   I'll go through the security with my laptop and I open it up and it goes--
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   I have ways of--
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   Yeah, that's going to-- I think they'll never let me through.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   This is Mac Sabre running on the new Macbook.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   One of the things that the new Macbook has actually do--
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   I think all of yours, right, the IBM's do certainly.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   Is this motion sensor to protect the hard drive.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   But somebody clever, based on how--
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   Clever hack.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   When you basically move the notebook, the sensor detects it and shuts down the--
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   And apparently, there's a way in the operating system to read the sensor.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   So if you're not telling you, that's actually the sound of your hard drive.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   [laughter]
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   Screaming and pain.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   The other one that I've seen like that is the MacBook.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   Yeah, you hit the side of it.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   And you hit it to sort of switch your application.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   It's a context switch.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   It's a great idea.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   That's a great idea.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   You rigged it into maps as well.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   So you could drag a map by tilting.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   Oh, Clever.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   I think this is the greatest thing.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   I think I'll-- you know, forget the hard drive.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   Don't I?
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   That was my Riley impression.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   This is a boy toy, I guess.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   I don't know.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   I just--
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   No, I just--
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   Oh, it's clever.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   I like it.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   Can you map it in any sound you want?
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720]   Can you make it so when you drop it it goes out?
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   No!
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   I'm just going to make it to emulate a similar toy.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   Chris is doing it with his-- is that a Lenovo or--
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   Oh, it's an IBM.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   Old IBM.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   And it's-- but see that's typical.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   Now there's an example of IBM software, Mac software.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   Yours is a picture of the computer going like this.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   A laptop ring wobble wobble.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   And mine is a lightsaber.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   [laughter]
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   By the way, what's cool is you can see the roll, the tilt, and the force.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   [laughter]
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   That was 120--
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   Seriously, I know I'm going to take the laptop right into the hole.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   I'm so sorry.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   It is this close.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   Okay, I'm putting it back.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   What you said?
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   Microsoft, apparently, also going to develop it now.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   Sources, I think we're trying to steal back the news cycle from the gate story.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   And now say that Microsoft is developing a music device and video-- music and video device and service.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   I'm dealing with the iPod and I do this.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   That's not-- the headline though is iPod killer.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Right, of course.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   Well, or--
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   Microsoft developing a rival.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   Not rival.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   A rival.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   You know, everybody's trying.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   But then it would have community-- everybody's trying, but only a few companies are trying.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   But only a few companies have, I think, the clout to get the licenses.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   So let's review Microsoft successes in hardware.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   Starting with the mouse.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   Right.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   Mice and keyboard.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   Let's see.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   Even before the sound card--
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   Before then, didn't they make a Windows card for Apple IIs?
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   They had a card that you could put in that would let you run--
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   Was that the CPM card?
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   No.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   Was the Microsoft made a CPM card?
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   What are those?
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.720]   Or a DOS card?
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   It was a DOS card.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   It was a DOS card.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   So that was their first--
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   Let's see, a bottom of their sound cards.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   Obviously, keyboards and mice are a different division.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   They say that the Microsoft Apple keyboard is the best Apple keyboard is made by Microsoft.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   I use a Microsoft keyboard with my Mac at home.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   They have one now with an Apple keyboard.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   And you like your Xbox 360?
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   I do.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   I have not upgraded.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   I have the old one.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   Patrick, do you like anything?
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.720]   At all.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   The part of me is like, remember the whole-- no, I'm going back.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   I encourage, actually, is a pretty good music system.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   The one that--
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   The MTV one?
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   Yeah, the one that they did in Kahoots with MTV.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   But then you look at the plays for sure, which was like Microsoft's like, we have all these
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   players and some of them work and some of them don't.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   Some of them say they work and some of them don't and half of them have DRMs important and
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   half of them don't.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   So they brought out the plays for sure sort of like Thing on the Box.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   Right.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   And nobody realized that everybody buys MP3 players by walking into a store where they either
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   have them all like on the CompUSA sort of expensive thing on a stick display or it's all chained
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   down and you look at it and all the labeling and box labeling has been ripped off of it.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   Or they mail order it and nobody cares about plays for sure because I've got still the
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   Apple cell is 83% in the market or something like that.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   Creative has these sort of inside angle by trying to sue them out of--
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   Right.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   It's getting nasty now.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   It is Apple sued back.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.720]   Apple sued back and now Creative went to the ITC saying in the international-- what is it?
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.720]   International Trade Commission saying there's a-- you better investigate Apple's practices
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   here and the ITC said OK.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   What's that ITC going to do?
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   Stop or we'll say stop again.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   Apple's in trouble in Scandinavia now Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   Originally they said till June 21st now they're going to give Apple until August 1st to reply
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   to the claims from these governments that iTunes Music Store and Service operates in violation
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   of Scandinavian consumer laws.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   They say that the user license-- the end user license agreement is illegal in all three countries
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   because basically because they don't have a DMCA so they don't require you-- they don't
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   have a requirement about not circumventing copyright.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   Right.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   And apparently the iTunes Store user license says that you cannot convert the files from
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   AAC to a non-dearm format.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   But in fact in those countries you can.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   What if I-- yeah.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   Well that's I mean then they either pull the service or they basically make it-- you know.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   But they can't change the label.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   They can't change the label.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   The labels will say well then I use it.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   So it's illegal to put copy protection on files in those three countries.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   Yes.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   I don't know if it's illegal to put copy protection on but it's illegal to say that you cannot
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.720]   circumvent the copy protection.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   So iTunes the pull out of the market.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   So iTunes the pull out of the market.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   You know, off your game.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   But that's what they said about France too.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   France too.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   It's the same thing that France wanted.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   They want to allow customers to put songs they buy in iTunes on their creative and other
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   players.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   Right.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   It's the same exact thing which only can be done if you remove or change the deal.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   Which frankly is what a growing number of consumers want too.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   I mean I think it's kind of interesting that there are companies that are--
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   Absolutely.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   There are countries that are sort of leading this effort and at some point one of them is
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   not going to back down.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   I mean France did because they weren't willing to risk not having iTunes and the iPod I guess
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   in their country.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   Well the question becomes how much of a lever does anyone country have over a multinational
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   corporation.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   Well you know what's said all this does is push everybody into Microsoft's camp because
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   that Microsoft works with all these other players.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   Yeah because they have an iPod killer coming.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   That's right.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   Well they're essentially saying--
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   Well if they have the service--
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   Yeah but see then all the iPod owners in that country can sue because of the DRM that locks them
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   out of the iPod.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   Both right.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   Right.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   So then that's really ugly.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   If everything I buy has both plays for sure and iTunes Fair Play DRM.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   I'm not buying another song in there.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   The grand irony here is that Creative Merges with Gem Plus and Gem Plus is the company that
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   sued everyone for putting up online television guides.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   Right.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   So they have a very long history of not liking it when people are in their business.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   Interesting.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   It's too bad too because I don't know.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.720]   You want to know what I'm thinking?
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   I think the creative players are getting better.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   It's just too bad that they're--
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   You know what I like?
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   You know what I like?
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   It's not like you're so--
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   It's not like you're so--
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   This new Moby Blue B153 has-- it's 153 hours and one battery.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   And it has a really neat feature.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   It has-- it will download your podcasts.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.720]   So you don't have to have podcast software on any computer.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   You just plug it onto any computer with an internet connection.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   It auto runs any Windows computer.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   It auto runs its software, downloads your podcast, puts it on the player, and you unplug.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   I think that's really slick.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   It's clever.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   And it's still not enough and that's the problem.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   You have to be so much better than the iPod because of the dominance.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   Well, I mean the iPod-- I mean the Apple doesn't really own that segment of the market where
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   it's flash based.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   You kind of argue back and forth.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   No, yeah.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   There's a lot more space there.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   Right.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.720]   And I've run into a lot of people who basically they like-- they want the FM radio or built-in
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.720]   or they want voice recording built-in.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   If you're buying iTunes songs, you're stuck with them.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   You kind of buy a nano or a shuffle, right?
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   Or you've moved the company.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   If you spend a lot of money on iTunes then you're stuck.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   Then you're stuck.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   And I convert them into MP3.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   Or you started releasing--
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   You started e-music.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   I think they only sell in MP3.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   Yeah, MP3.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   The E music and audio lunch, but two and another size too.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   Right, a magnet too.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   But they do it without any DRM.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   No DRM.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   Oh, the blue is that cute little blue one.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   It's weird.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   Yeah, now they have a bigger one.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   It's a cute-- it's a really, really surprising how good the audio is.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   The cute?
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   Yeah, the cute.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   Just don't sit on it because it hurts.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   It's so cute.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   True.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   It's cute about that whole jewelry MP3 player.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   Did you say that speaking of Sweden, the pirate bay now is moving back to Sweden?
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   We didn't like it in the Netherlands.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   They said they missed it.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   So different.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   I'm sure it is.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   It's a different language anyway.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   Yeah, they're something that pervert a lot of time.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   I mean, saying, okay, and not only that, but the Swedish law enforcement is being sued by
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   all the other companies whose servers they confiscated.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   For some reason, they confiscated a lot of different servers.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   But they just went in and grabbed everything.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   Everything in the racks.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   I don't understand how can they move down.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   They moved back.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   They were shut down there.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.220]   Well, you see, if you have a copy of the code that runs your site, you just go somewhere
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.220]   else and load it on the server and run it there.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.220]   I mean, it's a mess.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.220]   And the Swedish are never again.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   When the US comes knocking, when the motion picture association comes knocking, they say,
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.220]   you know, you solve this.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:26.220]   Well, but the guys in the guys at the boy, I'm going to finish the sentence if I have to
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   kill myself in the process.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.220]   So we have the very capable editors.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.220]   Kenji, remember to cut out everything in between the beginning and the end of the sentence.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.220]   It's going to be steward stuttering.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.220]   And go.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.220]   Yeah, but the pirate bay basically maintains what they're doing is not illegal under Swedish
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.220]   law.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.220]   Right.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.220]   You know, so, which also means the pirate bay could sue law enforcement.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.220]   Yes.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   And they will.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.220]   I'm sure they will.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   Those guys, they would show up in suits.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.220]   You know, I mean, can you imagine the courtroom antics with that be a phrase?
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.220]   They don't seem to pass up an opportunity, do they?
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.220]   No.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.220]   Well, that was the best reason to go to pirate bay.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   It's not to find torrents, is to read their responses to legal.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.220]   Right.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   Those are.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.220]   Well, did you see that in their reverse DNS?
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.220]   I was just going to say that.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.220]   Oh, no.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.220]   I'll let you say that.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.220]   You say the bad word on your podcast.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   Hey, this is the reverse DNS on their server when you go to their site.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.400]   Hey.mpaaand.apb.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.220]   bitemy.shiny.metal.ask.the piratebay.org.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.060]   I like it.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.220]   And I like the name of the pirate bay spokesman who said they're coming back.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.220]   What was his name?
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.780]   Oh, I'll see if I can find it.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.780]   I don't know.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.220]   But I like their pirate bravado.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.220]   Pirate bravado.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.220]   Yep.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.220]   R. R. You know, he should have a pirate name, but it was something silly.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.220]   McSweeney.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220]   Yeah, McSweeney.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   No, I'm not doing any more Swedish chef.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.220]   I've learned my lesson.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.220]   McSweeney's has a set of jokes for the literate pirate.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.220]   Have you seen this?
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   Pirate jokes for the sophisticated?
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.220]   Well, you know, there is a pirate core.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.220]   I think some of it will be a fascinating title.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.220]   Talk like a pirate day.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.220]   Talk like a pirate day.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   Well, the thing is, you know, their pirates apply to the world.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   Yes, no one sent me that link.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   They had to have a retail shop at the building.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.220]   What is a pirate's favorite aspect of computational linguistics?
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.220]   Power sing sentences.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.220]   Oh, God.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   That's the last one.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.220]   No, let's do it again.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   Timothy McSweeney.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   Yeah, first sophisticated.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220]   Pirate jokes for the sophisticated.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   It's funny.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   Funny stuff.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   So we're just going to surf and re-pirate jokes.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.220]   Why is Amazon selling great jokes?
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:32.220]   I don't really think they can.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   Is that crazy?
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.220]   What could happen to Peapod and all these other?
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:41.220]   All of the tiny little organizations I thought they were going to compete with the largest
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.220]   and most controlled.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   So you think it's a good idea?
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.220]   Well, no, but it was like the whole web van.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.220]   I mean, I sat on a panel, the dumbest panel that was sat on my life.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.220]   I pulled on.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   No, you laugh, right?
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:57.220]   But it was like three stock analysts that were very invested in the dot coms.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.220]   And they're all lecturing about how amazing web van is.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.220]   And I'm like, it's going to die.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.220]   It's a smoking crater.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   They just don't know that yet, right?
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.220]   Because all the supermarkets in the US operate in like 2% margins.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.220]   So you're going to build a distribution system.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   You're going to compete with these insanely huge organizations.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.220]   And they got crushed, right?
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   And I think Amazon is great.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.220]   They're just doing deals and they're doing it on the back end.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.220]   They've got people like the buy stuff.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.220]   So it's like it's Amazon.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.220]   It's actually great if you can't get it.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.220]   Amazon, they have a long history of moving and losing money on stuff that they sell.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.220]   Look how long it took to become profitable.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.220]   True.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   But they're profitable now, right?
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.220]   It's a lot of companies.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   I have to admit though, there's no way I'm going to order it because they don't tell any perishable.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.220]   No, it's just pasta cereals.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.220]   So why do I want to order cereal and then get it like three days later?
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220]   Wow, it's so nice.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.220]   Some people buy things in advance.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.220]   They can have it shipped to the Amazon.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.220]   Actually, you know what I've done in groceries?
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.220]   Well, no, but there's--
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.220]   I mean, I go to Costco and I buy it.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.220]   I'm going to go to Costco and I'm going to go to Costco.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.220]   I have stuff and I have it for a long time.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.580]   Anybody who's from other parts of the country is going to laugh when I say this, but it's
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.220]   really hard to find sweet touch knee tea, which is like, oh, you're a freak.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   When I say that, I guess sweet touch knee.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.860]   It's this weird sort of tea that you can get all over the East Coast, but you can't get
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   out here.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.220]   I'm like chock full and that's a good reason why, by the way.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   Well, maybe there is, but I have wise potato chips.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.220]   You know, I've never been a huge fan of wise potato chips, but I understand.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   Well, I understand.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.220]   Charles chips and he cans, right?
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:23.220]   But there's stuff like that where people will buy or I will buy, so this is the market
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.220]   of--
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.220]   I can't even--
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.220]   Char--
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   I can get behind it if it's regional stuff, for ice-oss or something like that, but I'm
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.220]   not seeing that.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.900]   You can actually buy sliders, the white castle hamburgers, and frozen in a box, the truck
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.220]   will come to your house and give you--
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.220]   Fettex, really?
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.220]   There are certain things you don't buy frozen.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.220]   That's one of them.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.220]   Two things you don't buy, period.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.220]   Well, no Amazon is in trouble when they start putting pet food on the list.
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   I mean, that'll check this back.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.220]   You can still order pet food online.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.220]   It's a delivery cost will kill you?
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.220]   The real problem was the kitty litter.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   I mean, shipping clay.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   We're going to ship gravel overnight.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   Over and night, gravel.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.220]   That was where really killed at Stuycken.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   So, do you see this?
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   I think this is just classic.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.220]   A ringtone, actually it's an alert tone for your cell phone.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.220]   What?
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.220]   That is--
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.220]   What?
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.220]   Well, it's for you and me to hear Doug.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.220]   Oh, yeah, that's for teenagers.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.220]   In fact, I could play-- you know what we'll do?
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   We'll insert the tone into the podcast.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.220]   It doesn't compress.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.220]   I should point out now.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.220]   You know, at the time it has it.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.220]   11 kilo-- we just spent a whole half a day here at the podcast academy talking about the
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.220]   11 kilohertz low pass filter.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.220]   So, it shouldn't be in the podcast no matter what.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:40.220]   All right, well, can we turn off the 11 kilohertz low pass filter just for the next few seconds?
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:45.220]   I'm going to turn them to file and have them edit it in because it'll get-- yeah, I'm not going to play it into my microphone.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.220]   I don't know if I'm cool enough to hear it.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   You hear it play already?
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.220]   I hear a whine, but I think it's your commission.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.220]   Anyway, if you heard that, then you can get SMS messages.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.220]   Ow!
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.220]   Ow!
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.220]   Ooh!
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.220]   Really annoying sound.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.220]   You hear that?
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.220]   You're kidding me.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.220]   You're going to hear that, Doug?
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.220]   Oh, that was tough.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.220]   If you hit that, I'll play it again.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.220]   I don't really truly don't do it again.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.220]   All right, all right, so here on the play.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.220]   You guys hear it?
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   No, your laptop's too low.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.220]   That's the problem.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   Ready?
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   I do actually hear it.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   I can't believe it.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.220]   I hear not a thing.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   And if you hear it.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   Okay, raise a hand if you're over 40 and you hear it.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   I actually heard it.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.220]   Maybe because I'm so close.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.220]   No, you think you hear it, sir.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.220]   You're--
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   I've heard pressure.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.220]   He felt it.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.220]   Yeah, I felt it.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.220]   I felt it.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.220]   Yeah, you-- yeah.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.220]   You know what's great is stop it.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:41.980]   Molly and Shuby, Shuby who's our new intern who is a software in high school, he's covering
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   his ears.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.220]   So apparently this is not a bad idea.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.220]   It's something high-frequency penetration for people over 40.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   I know, it just falls right off.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   So the idea is the teacher won't hear it, but you'll be getting an incoming-- of course,
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   if everybody-- if everybody-- if everybody-- all the kids in the class go--
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.220]   Ah!
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.220]   The teacher's going to-- something's up.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.220]   It doubles as a mosquito repellent, right?
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.220]   Sure.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.220]   You're good for that.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.220]   There are all sorts of things you can do.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.220]   These are teasing me.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.220]   You actually could hear something?
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.220]   No.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.220]   I'm doing here.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.220]   You're not there.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   I could send here.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.220]   We could--
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   We could--
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.220]   Here.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.220]   We could--
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.220]   We could--
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.220]   We could--
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.220]   Here.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.220]   They don't know if I'm hitting the play button or not.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   Ready?
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.220]   Tell me when you start hearing it.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.220]   Stop.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.220]   What's weird is people in the back of the room here.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.220]   Oh, this is a very-- well, bounce is right off them.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.220]   Okay.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.220]   I'm stunned.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.220]   And it just shows you.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.220]   I mean, that's an MP3, and it's being played on a cheesy little speaker.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.220]   What a wild idea.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.220]   So that can't seem that really having a wide adoption.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.220]   No.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.220]   Ringtone podcast.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:44.360]   Well, there's a grocery store in England that started playing extremely high-frequency
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.220]   noises to keep the kids hanging out in front of the store.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.220]   I mean, I think--
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.220]   Yes.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   Yes.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.540]   I got a call on the radio show this week, a woman who's complaining because people with
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.740]   very loud basses were sitting in front of her and they were rattling her china.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.980]   And she said, "Is there anything I can do?"
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.740]   And actually, if I'd known, I would have said, "You could play extremely high-pitched
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.220]   stones out the window freak out of the run."
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.220]   I don't know.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.220]   I am stunned.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.220]   I didn't know.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.940]   I mean, I listened to that 30 times.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.940]   I didn't hear a thing and I thought, "Oh, this is a joke.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.940]   The times is foisting on us."
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.180]   Well, I don't know if this will be edited out and it can be.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.220]   But have you ever heard the hypersonic sound speakers?
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.220]   Amazing.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.220]   Maybe great for something like this, this high-pitched like cannon.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.220]   The aim-- Woody Morris.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.220]   Woody Norris does this.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.220]   Yes.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.700]   And the idea is as you walk by a Pepsi machine, you don't hear anything until you get right
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.700]   in front of it.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.700]   Right, check that out.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   Drink, drink, drink.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.700]   And then you keep going and it's hard.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.700]   You have an RFID chip.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.700]   That's awful.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.700]   I'm taking that big out.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   You can put this ringtone that you can't hear.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.700]   I got a copy of it all the time too.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.700]   I think there's a scanner to people that can't hear it.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.700]   They're walking around saying, "Oh yeah, I bought that."
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   I think it's the embers that close.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.180]   I think you guys are all teasing me.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.340]   I don't think there is any sad.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.700]   We're not coordinated enough to tease you.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   Yeah, no.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:59.860]   Can you hear about this gambling, the Washington State gambling law where they said that
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:06.780]   online gambling is now a felony with a punishable offense like equal to child pornography.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:12.380]   But now they're saying that it also applies to websites that talk about gambling.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.060]   So there was a quote when they originally started talking about the law that said that
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.380]   this guy's site where he talks about online gambling and links out to it is potentially
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.380]   in violation.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:25.740]   Someone at the Seattle Times wrote a column about it and they told him that the column
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.380]   itself might actually be in violation of the law.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.380]   I'd like to see it hurry up.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.100]   Now you guys say this for remember what's one of the tenants of the DMCA that if you link
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.420]   to something that's illegal, it's the same as doing the illegal law itself.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.380]   You know you sat by and you said, "Oh, it's just pirates doing it."
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.580]   Now it's going to bite all you in the butt.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.580]   I testified in that case.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.380]   Why doesn't this just hurry up and get to court and then get over time?
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.380]   Still unhappy about that.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.860]   I'll tell you something that is going to court.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:55.900]   Cablevision is suing Hollywood because Hollywood is claiming that the video on demand, the
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.420]   DVR stuff is illegal.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.380]   So this is essentially countersuit trying to get a new stream sued out of existence quickly.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.380]   Quickly.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.380]   Quickly.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.380]   If we don't want to make any money there, still like it.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.380]   All the dogs.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.380]   I hear a high pitch dog.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.540]   I didn't get to explain this one.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.540]   This is an important one.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.220]   I think it's very important.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:20.460]   Let's start with the lawsuit, the 20th Century Fox Universal Paramount, Disney, CBS, ABC,
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.460]   and NBC.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.460]   I think that's everybody.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.180]   You filed against Cablevision.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:31.420]   I think that "remote storage," in other words, a DVR, a Tivo like box, which Cablevision
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:37.220]   and many other companies sell, is the equivalent of video on demand and therefore violates
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.220]   fair use provisions.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.780]   In other words, you've got a pay us if you have DVRs in your system.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.260]   If you allow your customers to use digital video records.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.900]   So is this a Canadian model?
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.220]   Anybody who buys one of these has to pay us a flat rate, like they do for media in the
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:57.140]   land of the north or is this if you actually download our content and play our content?
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.860]   I think Cablevision's deal was that it was an online DVR and with the stuff that you
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.860]   record.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.860]   It's stored on Cablevision servers.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.860]   It's not the box.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.860]   It's the game.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.860]   It's not the box.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.860]   It's like video on demand.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.500]   So they were saying that it was essentially unauthorized video on demand, but it's not.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.900]   You recorded it.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.900]   You did it.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.500]   But it's only on demand in the sense that you record it's just as on demand as Tivo,
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.060]   which is not stored at your house.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.060]   Interesting.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.060]   It's stored remotely.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.220]   They want it to be like Betamax.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.540]   And say, this adheres to the Betamax decision.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.660]   It's a VCR or a DVR set up.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.660]   So I'm sorry.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660]   I misunderstood.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.820]   So that's the difference is you're recording it on there.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.580]   So the Cablevision server is not on your own.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.780]   It still has pretty far reaching implications.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.900]   Certainly, if the studios win this one, it's a little disturbing because it sets up a precedent
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   about recorded content.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.500]   Yeah, because then I'm going to get to concast ships you a DVR.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.740]   It's part of your deal.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.980]   Is that the same thing?
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.980]   Exactly.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.500]   So I think any of us who love our DVRs.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.300]   We shouldn't give these guys a name.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.300]   Dave, Tivo, save.
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   No Cablevision.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   Are you my DVR?
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.100]   Cablevision is actually a very forward looking company.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.100]   I like them.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.540]   They're one of the smallest cable providers.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.380]   They're small, but because they are Manhattan's cable provider.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.660]   New York's cable provider, right?
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.660]   They are influential.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.660]   They're very influential.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.380]   And very technologically savvy because they have a dense small market that's easy to roll
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.860]   stuff like this out to.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.860]   Right.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.660]   But it's interesting too because I didn't actually, when I first heard about the Cablevision
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.460]   DVR proposal, I wasn't interested.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.460]   I was like, oh, well, I don't want to store my supermole.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.460]   I have a DVR.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.460]   Right.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.460]   But now I'm like, go Cablevision.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.460]   Right.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.460]   I love you, little guy.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.460]   I think it's not a bad idea.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.180]   The thing is, I bet you they're not really recording anything for you.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.700]   It's essentially putting a little marker.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.700]   They have everything, right?
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.060]   And it's putting a little marker saying, oh, Molly wanted this.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.420]   So the technology itself could be on demand.
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.740]   Yeah, I doubt very much they're making unique recordings for every person.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.740]   Why not?
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.740]   Because why?
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:47.020]   You all use one recording of every channel and you can give it to Molly and Patrick.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.180]   You don't have to have a separate.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.220]   How would you get that content and be able to keep it without having to license it?
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.220]   I don't know.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.220]   So you have to use to do that.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.220]   I think the storage problems are more problematic.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:58.380]   If you're trying to record every channel you distribute on the local servers and it is,
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.060]   if you just try to record with people like you.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.300]   So you're going to buy one of these Blu-ray players, Samsung and shipping, finally, a
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.460]   thousand bucks.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.460]   Ten available titles.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.460]   Ten movies.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.460]   Isn't it?
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.460]   Good ones too.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.460]   Right?
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.460]   Because they're not shipping in the US until the 25th.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460]   Well, okay.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.460]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.460]   That's the other day.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:20.300]   And I noticed they're shipping HD DVDs and they said they'll ship both Blu-ray, HD.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.300]   They couldn't care less.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:23.300]   Right.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.300]   So they already have like a whole wack of HD.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.020]   Here's the ten Blu-ray titles, ladies and gentlemen, just so you know what movies you'll
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.620]   be able to see on your thousand dollar player.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.620]   Thousand dollar.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.620]   Fifty first dates.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.620]   It's all right.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.620]   You don't have to cover your sons here.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.620]   The fifth.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.620]   The fifth.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   The fifth element.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.620]   That's a good movie.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.620]   Like that.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.620]   Although pretty old.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.620]   It's a good look.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.620]   Well, there's a reason they released that.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.620]   That's one of the standards.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.620]   Almost everybody who has HD TV.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:47:13.200]   They spend a lot of time going through the
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   same thing.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   I'm so impressed.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   This is Heath Ledger's.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   This is a great movie.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   Really?
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   Yeah, it's pretty and fun.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   But he's kind of like got this New York accent, but he's a nice.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   Paul's last name.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   I think we should go home.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   I think he's great.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.720]   And I like the blacksmith chicks.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   She was great.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.720]   You know?
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.720]   The blacksmith chick.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   Yeah, they were an idiot all the time.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.360]   I'm getting through the whole like, you know, incredibly stupid.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.160]   They used rock music.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   Well, sorry.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.160]   It's a...
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.160]   I'll put it in a vacuum, but not an AC.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   You have to see it.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   You have to.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.160]   You have to.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   You're Netflix.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.280]   Well, the selection is an H-E-D-V-D, because I've been getting a lot of the H-E-D-V-D movies
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.160]   because when we review that and the movies, they're picking are incredibly random.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.160]   It's totally random.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.920]   Listen, the last Waltz, okay, that's a good concert film.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   One of the best.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   No, no, no.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   The last Waltz is...
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   I think the one I'm talking about is the other one.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   The one with a...
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   They're not taking a J-Lo movie?
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   They're not taking a J-Lo movie.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   Not the band?
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   They're talking about the last Waltz?
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   No, no.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   You're talking about the last year, Auntie.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   The last day.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.080]   Well, wouldn't you rather I protect you from that movie?
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.080]   Yes.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.080]   Don't ever really set an H-D.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.320]   Resident Evil Apocalypse.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.320]   Not the original.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.320]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.800]   So it's two-mild J-O-V-A-Trivis out of the ten available.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   Interesting.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.640]   Maybe they've got something going on here.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   A Samsung Mila J-O-V-A-Tsh.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   I think she's actually...
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   She's in charge.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   She's running Samsung.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:35.040]   She runs out of her Sony and Triple X, another movie that doesn't have Mila J-O-V-A-Tsh.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   Does not have Mila J-O-V-A-Tsh.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   So she's in...
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.280]   She's in 20% of all these Blu-ray titles.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   She's in them.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   It's cool looking.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   It is cool looking.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   I just...
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   A thousand bucks, you know?
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.880]   They say that we'll sell everyone we make.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.160]   I just can't understand who, honestly, even if you don't want a PlayStation 3, why wouldn't
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   you just buy that?
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   Have you ever tried to use like...
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   Instead of a standalone player that costs...
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   Right.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.080]   Yeah, but all the DVD players based on gaming consoles, they either suck a lot or they really,
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.080]   really suck a lot.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.360]   Yeah, it says it sucks $600 a lot because like...
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.840]   But this is early adopter territory.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   This is not rational person.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.360]   These are people with the old American Express cards and nothing to do.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.480]   People have been staring at the same 15 films on the HD4.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.960]   The download of the really big Mila J-O-V-A-Tsh fans.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   Oh, work.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   I'll put the V2.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   They already need the HD DVD for them.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.840]   But how many times have we talked about a new technology and we said, "Oh, I've got
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.720]   a thousand dollars who would pay for it and a few years later everybody's buying it?"
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.240]   Yeah, but watch, I can do this.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   At this point, it's like...
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   Anybody had $150?
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   Yeah, $150.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   For black.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.360]   So that it matches you guys.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.160]   It'll be interesting to see what it looks like.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.480]   Slading for release on Blu-ray include basic Insta 2.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   Two, not one.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.480]   Stealth.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.000]   And, well, the Terminator, I'd like to see that.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.120]   The ninth film, Ultraviolet, third Miljevovich movie.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   Oh!
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.520]   Okay, there's definitely something going on here.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   You know?
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   I'm just saying.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   There's something going on.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   Come on.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   I think we've got a scoop here.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   Let's see, let's see.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.680]   Thrurally adopters, consumer electronics, geeks.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   Boy, Mila.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   I don't know.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.680]   It's a little...
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.080]   I had a cameo on basic Insta.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   That's all I'm thinking.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.320]   Is that the thread that folded all together?
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.480]   So we've got to watch what we seem to be in there.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.960]   Somehow, I suspect there's...
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.200]   Is she still married to Lucas?
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Yes.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Oh, she is.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   They got a divorce.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.560]   Oh, boy, this is turned into a car.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   I was kind of waiting.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   What's about the cost of a program?
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   I would believe that Lucas is...
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.760]   I think I'll be buying a Blu-ray player.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.760]   But now I'm in the last one.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.200]   So is Sony going to drop the price on players at Thanksgiving?
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.280]   Or are they going to try to force everybody on their PS3s?
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   I think this is...
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   I think you're right.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.840]   I think it's going to be a PS3, a much better deal.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   Much more exciting.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.120]   I mean, it's still $600 bucks.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   It's still $600 bucks.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   It's still $400 dollars.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   It's not small per se.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.720]   The Samsung's making it look like it's a cheaper deal, a better deal, right?
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.720]   As long as there's a format, or...
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   Yeah, nobody's going to buy it.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.200]   I mean, it's one thing to be an early adopter, but to really wait into a format, or at this
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   point.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   Netflix is going to support everything.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   Yeah, Netflix is going to support...
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   What I've actually heard of is making a normal decision.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.760]   I have this, and porn is all about Blu-ray.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.960]   Yeah, people always porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   porn is all about Blu-ray?
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   Yeah, porn is for Blu-ray.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   Not HD DVD.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.080]   So I've heard that some other studios are saying, "Well, I think we're going to get behind
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.160]   Blu-ray because porn is doing it."
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   Interesting.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.160]   Because they...
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.920]   That's what killed laser discs they say was that they weren't willing to allow it for...
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.640]   Eventually it did, but initially they weren't too late to save it.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   Too late to save it, yeah.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.080]   Because it was such an easy format to store.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   So...
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.080]   Oh!
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.320]   It's like your laptop.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.520]   They're good weapons.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   I never saw the ringerfear.com.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.160]   The ring is the other one?
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   Did you ever see that?
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.160]   No, the reason I mention it is there's a...
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.160]   The village of Ovidsh...
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.520]   There's no village of Ovidsh connection to this next story, but there is a worm called
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.320]   Black Angel Bee, which spreads over MSN messenger.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.720]   And what it does is it says, "The message is on the first day you get scared.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   On the second, you get desperate.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.160]   On the third, you look for help, and on the fourth, you die."
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:05.000]   I can't decide if this is a great hack or like some 14-year-old kid that needs to be kicked
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   in the head of the game.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   There's only one problem.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   It's Spanish.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.880]   It was in the ring seven days, so it was too lazy to think of seven days worth of things.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.320]   So it would go right over my head.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   Oh, I'll have a picture.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   It's actually a person.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   I'm kind of freaky.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.320]   Who reads Spanish?
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   Who reads Spanish?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   Oh, who reads Spanish?
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.320]   Oh, who reads Spanish?
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.320]   Oh, who reads Spanish?
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   Oh, who reads Spanish?
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   I don't understand how you could do such good accents, and yet fail to fake it when you're
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.320]   reading the thing.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.120]   I mean, they're irritated at that spot.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.120]   They say they're different.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   That Russian accent was unbelievable.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   I can't speak Spanish.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   I can't speak Spanish.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   I can't speak Spanish.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.600]   I can do an accent.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.400]   I can't speak it.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.200]   There are actually a couple of now.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   Is it actually a delete thing?
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   No, I mean, that's really matters.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.200]   No, it just spreads itself.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   And then it kills you.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.680]   Oh, and it makes it so that you can't...
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.680]   Can't mean you die, so...
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   Oh, it makes it so you can't...
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.680]   But how's my computer?
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   It's at least like a level seven.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   The security...
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.120]   The megalovell level of seven point four.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   It makes it so you can't...
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   It's co-purple virus.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   It's co-purple virus.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   You die.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.760]   According to Panda, you can't use your control panel.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760]   So that's it.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   All right.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   Don't be able to add a printer.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   So we were talking about Netflix.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.760]   Yes.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.640]   I'm curious about this story about Netflix patent on cues, for rental cues.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   They're suing Blockbuster.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.480]   And what does it mean to people like IT conversations that have a cue?
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   You have a cue?
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.480]   I think you should sue them.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   I think it's a cue for moving.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.280]   I'll go and say listen, I'll go and testify.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.280]   I must sue the...
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   The...
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   Ask me some knowledge about Blockbuster.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.080]   Are they knocking in my door right now when I'm not home?
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.520]   The Blockbuster executive said it's akin to a hamburger joint saying we patented the idea
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.520]   of a drive-through.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.480]   Yeah, it's pretty redo... like the idea that you could patent the idea of...
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.320]   Creating a list of movies in the order in which you want to view that.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.280]   But in their defense, that is the thing that...
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   I think drive-throughs.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.560]   Who could you get that patent?
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.040]   That's the thing that makes Netflix so cool.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.120]   I mean, it really is the defining...
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.840]   Isn't it the defining feature of Netflix?
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   I mean, you could...
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.840]   Is that you make this list...
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.200]   Well, other than the fact that you've got delivered to the mail and it works.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   But others have done that.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:01.560]   I think the thing that's addictive about it is this maintaining, massaging, creating your
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   cue.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.400]   Would you say it's obvious or non-obvious?
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.600]   Ah, isn't that the crux of Pat Law?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   It'd be quite good to us.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   Or anyone ever thought of us.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.560]   You say the patent system is broken or non-broken.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.280]   I feel bad for Joey Ito because he's...
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.600]   I don't know if he's going to be able to put his screenshots on Flickr anymore.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   Did you see that?
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.160]   There's a big problem, I guess, on Flickr because everybody's putting up there.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.920]   And I think screenshots from World of Warcraft and Second Life as if it's real life.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.640]   Like, "Oh, snap of me and my eight, my paladin friends."
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   Right.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   You know, this is...
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.640]   But then Flickr's taken them down.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   But then Flickr's taken them down.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.640]   Killing things like the motion picture industry now.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   You know, you go out to school...
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   Screenshot?
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   No, you just got to shoot on location and you've got to think about every single thing
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   in the background.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   That didn't used to be the case.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.400]   This is a big problem if you just capture things coincidentally.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   You and I think it's because people don't have...
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.600]   I can't say this, they don't have the nerve anymore to just tell people, "Why don't you
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.560]   get the hell away from me?"
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.560]   You know?
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.720]   Like, I suppose you were filming out here in front of Intel and they sent security guides
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   out of there.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.280]   Hey, you can't film in front of our building?
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   Get the hell away from me.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.280]   Oh, I like it.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   Make them call the police.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.280]   Here's the weird thing about this flick thing.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   That's the end of it.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   Yeah, but with film they come back afterwards.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   After you've gone and made some money.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   See, here's the problem, right?
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   It costs so much to defend yourself.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.520]   So we need a lot of rich people saying, "Get the hell away from me."
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.520]   So then they can't be sued.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.840]   Are there any rich people listening now that would like to go annoy people with a video
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.840]   camera?
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.840]   I have all kinds of ways you're going to annoy people.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.840]   I have a list.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.840]   Do you have a list?
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.840]   I have a list.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.840]   This sounds like a good one.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:33.840]   I wish I was rich because I love annoying people.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.840]   You look blog-less, I do.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.840]   I could have a blog.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   I could have a blog.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   I could have a rich people to do.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.240]   Why don't you call Mark Cuban and say, "Mark, I've got an idea for it."
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   Oh, he's pretty annoying.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.040]   He could do his cut money and lawyers.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.040]   He might be the guy.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.520]   He might be the guy.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.200]   Every day I knew annoyance.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.320]   It's funny because I think I was in a year ago, I was taking photos and I was going to
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   figure it out.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   I'm like, "Go call a cop."
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.680]   And he looked at me like I was the alien.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.880]   There's a lawyer who's actually put together a pretty good set of guidelines for what you
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.960]   can and cannot legally film.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.840]   A lot of times it's pretty cool to come out and tell you to go take a hike.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.360]   You can't photograph a billion.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.360]   Actually, you can.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   You can't.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   What do you think you can do?
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.520]   They say right of way, they have a sign to say right of way.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.680]   It can be revoked at any time.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   Like you're in a mall.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.880]   Isn't the urban center.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   I mean, you're in there.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.320]   I'm okay with them throwing me out.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   This is the thing.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.560]   If they're right, throw me out.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.640]   If you're wrong, I'm going to come after you.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.280]   No, the problem is throw me out.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.440]   Let me say you're on location.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   Let's say you're on location.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.160]   It's the course out on location.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.920]   They're filming something.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.320]   Behind them is a poster.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.320]   Right?
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.520]   And that poster is copyrighted, licensed, whatever material.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   Yeah, that's annoying.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.440]   But it happens to be in the location.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   Right.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.440]   And now this is something we never used to worry about in that kind of thing.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   You have to blur it out now.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.640]   Yeah, you have to blur it out.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   You have to blur it out.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.000]   Although, beginning back to the Flickr thing, the one weird thing about this Flickr thing
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.640]   is that Flickr is not saying that the screenshots that take them down has anything to do with
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   copyright.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   I mean, if they made that argument, it would be annoying.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   But totally understandable.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   They're going.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   It's an aesthetic question.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.640]   It's even weirder.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.840]   Yeah, it's like they're saying that we're only for photos.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.840]   So here's the other side of it.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:13.840]   It is their site.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.320]   They can do anything they want.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   Well, I think it's their business model.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   I think it's their business model.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.320]   Well, that's okay.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   It is.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   You should go elsewhere.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   But they shouldn't do that.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.560]   They're not really taking them down.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.560]   They're just not making them searchable or showing up for them.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   Yeah, they're not searchable.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   It's not public.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.960]   So you can still have them on there and so forth.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:35.040]   Well, I think it's also interesting that increasingly our snapshots are not of real life.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   They're of our virtual lives.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   That's kind of yours.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   Yeah, I can't get into the...
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   I'm not too sorry.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.520]   Yeah, I'm afraid of World War 2.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.840]   So tell us about your virtual lives.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.440]   Well, I'll tell you, the second life is the only place I live good in a speedo.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.120]   Let's put it that way.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.760]   Did you bring the speedo today?
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.040]   I did not.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.240]   One last story.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:58.120]   Microsoft says there is a critical hole in Windows 98 and M.E. and...
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   Maybe 8 and M.E.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.120]   Oh no!
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.120]   Shocker.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   We're not going to fix it.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   That's the shocker.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   And the life's that way.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   Did anybody complain?
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   The end of life is in July.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.000]   They extended it.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.920]   But it's a significant flaw.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   And if you...
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.880]   Basically there are responses, upgrade to XP.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   We will not fix it.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.880]   They said it's essentially too much work at this point to fix it.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:20.880]   They have to rewrite support.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.880]   So they're going to support anyway.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.880]   I don't blame them.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:28.360]   I don't blame them except for how many millions of boxes, unattended and somewhat attended
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.160]   boxes are running this.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   It's not merely for these individual users.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.160]   A lot.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   We did it.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:38.000]   We talked about this on the Buzz out loud podcast and we polled our users and said, "Right
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.280]   to us and tell us if you're still using 98.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.760]   The emails are still coming."
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.480]   We talked about it early this week.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.880]   Comment if you are still using Windows 9 data.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.080]   I mean, in case you have to, in case you just happen to...
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   I think they'll want to.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   And no, please.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   It's over 57.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:58.640]   57 almost broke the server.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   I can help you with that.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.640]   Would you...
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   Do you know anybody with server space?
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   I got a second for my hands.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   Yeah, okay.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   Yeah, actually I know about your 20% project.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   It's kind of related to that.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   I'll let's go there.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   All right.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.760]   Did you see Netscape's dig rip off?
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.720]   I did.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.040]   Kevin asked to be on the show, but he couldn't be here today.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.760]   So I mean, we'll have him talk about it next week.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.160]   Patrick, would you like to be Kevin today?
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.520]   Well, actually I have a quote from Kevin because we were talking about this on D.L.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   TV yesterday.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:27.400]   We also, I should point out, have the people that the Silicon Valley homebrew mobile phone
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   crew on the show.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.400]   Oh, cool.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.400]   You had that hammer guy.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.400]   Great.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   Hammerch's really neat guy.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:36.880]   But Kevin said this is a direct quote from Kevin loosely interpreted.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.440]   They really should have waited until next week because there's going to be a whole bunch
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.440]   of stuff they want to copy.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:43.400]   Well, it's a 3.0 next week.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:49.320]   Kevin's showing selected members of the press, including, I think, you've also been
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.840]   leaving me on Thursday pictures of the actual site.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.240]   I have to say, by the way, Jason Collicannis, who is running this Netscape thing, was on
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.840]   the podcast last week, didn't give me a scoop.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   Anyway, here we go.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.000]   Kevin Rose is a pre-bout that AOL clone just right now when they see dig version 3.0,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   they'll have to redesign their site.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Nice done.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.120]   Well, it is still a beta, so they can incorporate their copy to the theater.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.400]   Well, Collicannis, like, Collicannis, was that Netscape didn't copy dig any more than
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.760]   dig, copied, you know, delicious or they copied dig.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.680]   They even got the little rectangles.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   What do we expect?
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.320]   It's a total copy.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   But who cares?
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   Who cares?
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.320]   Who cares?
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   If they do it better, they'll do well.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.200]   They have four times the audience of dig.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.920]   They have 800 million page views on them.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.000]   Is there a patent file in there that never changed the game of the world?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Hopefully not.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Because again, not.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   It's not non-obvious.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   Why does it work to find this stuff?
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   It's www.netscape.com.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.640]   No, beta.netscape.com.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640]   You can't just say beta.netscape.com.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.120]   No, you need the www.netscape.com.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.120]   But it is essentially not not.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.120]   It's not.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.120]   It's the new Netscape.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120]   It's the new Netscape.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.080]   A couple of things are different.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.840]   First of all, they do have editors.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.240]   So the top of the page is editorial, but you can vote.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.080]   And what's the top story?
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.680]   Who there is wants to pay FEMA for it.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   What?
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680]   It wants to be a limited way.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.880]   Well, they have this weird rotating carousel at the top.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880]   Okay.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.320]   Which is the Netscape recommendation.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   That's their editor's choice.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   How they?
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.880]   They have the voting top stories, which so far every time I've come here have been about
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.880]   Dig.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.720]   And on the day it launched, it was Netscape copies Dig with a big picture of Kevin and
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   Rose.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.760]   So obviously it's Dig users that are going to be using this first.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   Right.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.000]   I mean, I don't work for Dig or Netscape, but I'm not really that mad.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.960]   You know, they do some things like, boy, it's hard to care about this.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.440]   It is hard to care about.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440]   You're right.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   Let's go back to Windows 98.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440]   I mean, I told them to care about Dig that one.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440]   Do I care about that Windows 98?
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.600]   I use it as a little pop down feed.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   How many people are using Windows 98?
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   Windows M8.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600]   Windows 98 or AM8?
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   Oh, we still have more than a lot of data.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   I think people care about that.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.160]   You've got more than half a dozen.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.520]   But the point is not so much to protect users themselves but to protect the network.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.200]   If you have millions of machines using this on our past operation.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.240]   We need to get the check from the watersoft.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.400]   Quit listeners if you're using anything old in an XP update now.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.760]   No, I'm not saying they should update.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.600]   I'm saying Microsoft should have to fix it.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600]   Okay, I just want to make that call.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.800]   I'm not saying, I'm not saying, I mean, no, there's far too many machines out there that's
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.880]   not worth paying any money for it or what XP can, but they're still unused.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.200]   They still haven't been that.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.680]   And because Microsoft refuses to patch, this is a public health hazard, I think.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.120]   But should they patch it if it means that Vista and IE patches won't get done or that
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.320]   XP and IE patches won't get done or won't come out?
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   They have a responsibility.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.200]   They've voiced these operating systems on us.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.200]   They have responsibility to keep the money.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.560]   I think the war chest is still working.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.000]   Microsoft that they could buy through the air for a sponsoring.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.040]   I think other companies have an abdicated past versions.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040]   These are microspots.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.520]   There's always an end of life.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.520]   Much more than what you have.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.480]   It's different when you have 500 million copies from your phone down there.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   It's very different.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.960]   I think I tell this point people have had the sense that they took that responsibility pretty
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   seriously.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.800]   I think this is the first time they've said, "Look, I'm sorry, we got to write it off."
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   Not going to do it.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800]   Not going to do it.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   You're around 95, though.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.960]   We have copies of Ubuntu here for anybody who's just take that install.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.560]   If you're on 98, take this.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.560]   But I mean, maybe that's the solution.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   SUSE.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   SUSE.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.800]   Get everybody to run Linux.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.400]   I guess we could take some questions from the floor if you want to talk about this week's
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]   news.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.640]   We're from the people on the floor.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.840]   There are some on the floor at this point, actually.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.080]   The floor is a witty questioner.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.600]   But not questions about podcasting, because we'll do those for after the broadcast.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   But if you have questions about it.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600]   Any questions on this?
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.600]   Nothing.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   They couldn't care less.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.600]   Nothing.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   You know, you'd think this bunch would jump up to plug their podcast.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.520]   Say, "Hi, I'm Michael O'Habitt from Real Radio.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.520]   Real reviews."
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   "What would we do?"
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.200]   "Is John see you have a blog?"
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   Blogged out of work.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   John doesn't show up.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   He doesn't get the plug.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200]   You almost did, though.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.200]   That's my philosophy.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   He's famously doing that on this.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   Yeah, I guess he would be.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   Yes, he would be.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   Do you want a concert?
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.800]   Go up to the microphone over there.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.000]   Yeah, otherwise, not yet.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.600]   Yeah, otherwise, we'll use it before the microphone over there.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.480]   Audience is just taking a word for saying the fact that there is a live audience here
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   today.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   So, I heard him laugh.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.320]   And I heard him groan when we played that pitch.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   No, no.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   We've dubbed Eddie.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   That's a laugh track.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   That's a laugh track.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   You've heard our audio out of the.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   Ooh.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   That Leo does not know what he's doing.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.560]   Actually, I want to thank there were a lot of Twit listeners.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.560]   I put the raw tracks from last week up.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.560]   That was cool.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.560]   That was cool.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.640]   And I haven't been able to post them all.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.560]   I was surprised about 30 different people took the challenge on it.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.400]   And every one of them did a better job than I did.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.480]   Did they do the whole show?
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   They did the whole show.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.040]   Okay, so explain that for a second.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.200]   Well, we can do that later.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.320]   But the fact is that there were some audio problems.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.440]   You put up the audio for people to do a remix essentially and see what they come up with.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.440]   And they did a great job.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   That's always on a humbly, unspeakably cool people are out there listening.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440]   We have some great people.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.160]   What's going to be our new test for audio engineers is to send them your show and say,
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160]   "Save this."
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.800]   If you can fix this, we'll give you a job.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   Say this.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.200]   Would you remember Patrick, you know, if you can read this, you can get a job.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.440]   Remember on the subway?
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440]   Yes.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   There was one guy though.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.040]   I thought there'd be more joke edits, but there was only one I got.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   I looked at it and said, "But this is only 3 megabytes.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.040]   What could it be?"
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.280]   And the entire podcast was Patrick saying, "Welcome to Twit.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.960]   What did you say about sending marsupials on fire?"
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960]   Yes.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.560]   And then I said another Twit sent the can and that was it.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.200]   It was over.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   Reduced to the essence.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.200]   The essence.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.560]   I will send that to you.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   I should post.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560]   Make it your ringtone.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560]   I think it was a very good one.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   Yes, sir.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.800]   No, my question was regarding Windows 98.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:47.320]   My son has a vast library accumulated of software that only runs on 98, frankly.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   There's a good point.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.740]   And you know, I'm not going to spend the money for XP and then try to go back and find
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.500]   these educational titles that I've accumulated over time and bring it up to snuff.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.100]   What was the vulnerability exactly?
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   What am I looking at here?
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.500]   Do I just unplug them from the internet?
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.500]   I'm plugging them in.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.900]   Actually, I'm pretty sure that it's preventable by firewall.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:06.900]   Oh.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.900]   What I read it.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.900]   Security bug relates to...
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.740]   It's a problem, but it's a serious flaw, but if you have a firewall, you should be
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   fine.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:13.900]   It's the last I heard about it.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.900]   It's a flaw in Explorer.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.900]   Don't use IE.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:22.220]   And it could let an intruder commandeer a vulnerable PC.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:27.780]   Microsoft's recommendation is use a network firewall that filters port 139, which is...
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   It's using Firefox.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   Firefox.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.420]   Yeah, or a router would do it.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.580]   No, not Firefox, because it's a network.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.580]   Just a network.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.140]   A network router would take care of it.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.380]   It's a NetBio support vulnerability.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.620]   They want you to buy another Windows XP box that uses a firewall.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.260]   It's all the Windows 98.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.700]   There you go.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.700]   That's a great idea.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.700]   So, if...
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.700]   Or just take it off the net.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.700]   I mean, really, that's...
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.100]   I think ultimately that's what's going to have to happen with these Windows 98 boxes.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.700]   They're no longer Internet suitable.
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   Right?
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:54.700]   Probably true.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.140]   And thank you so much, Leo, for encouraging me to podcast my passion, because I have.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.140]   Oh, good.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.140]   I really appreciate it.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.140]   What's your podcast?
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.140]   101 uses for baby wipes.
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.140]   I know I get a lot of last week's titles.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.500]   The channel I got 20,000 subscribers, so...
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   That's great.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.500]   Nice to meet you.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.500]   That's great.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.660]   Yeah, the new podcast with XPODCAS in September, I think.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:18.900]   Yes, Podcast Academy 4 will be at the portable media and podcast.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900]   Are you going to do that?
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.780]   It's September 28th, Ontario, California.
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.780]   We'll be there.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.780]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.780]   I guess I better go.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.940]   Oh, well, we'll make it a party.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.420]   I guess I better go.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.420]   Yes, sir.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.620]   So, the aspect of the Bill Gates story I haven't heard yet is when the next head of state comes
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:36.260]   to visit who promises to fix their computer.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.280]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.700]   I doubt Ray Aussie will be doing it.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.140]   And you certainly don't want Steve Baume or anywhere near your computer.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.260]   He might fix it like Patrick would with a sledgehammer.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.620]   No, no, he uses a chair.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.620]   A chair?
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.620]   That's a good question.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.180]   I don't have the chief chief of state.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.180]   The geek of state.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:56.540]   And I wonder how much longer Bill will do the keynote to CES and stuff like that.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:00.860]   Now that would be sad because I think that that was the one thing that made CES fun.
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:01.860]   Let's go get performance.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.020]   Watch the fall apart year after year.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:08.260]   Some people had said that Bill, Jerry Parnell said this in his column and bite.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.340]   I've heard others say it.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:14.140]   Jerry said that at Winheck, Bill was unusually downed and seemed like he was really enjoying
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.140]   himself very much.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.820]   I've seen others say he was quote relaxed.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.820]   I think Bill has been kind of dialed out the last six months.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:22.820]   This has been an almost long time.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:23.820]   I think so.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.260]   I think he's ready to go.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   That's what I think.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   She'll be.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.260]   Hi.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.260]   About Netflix suing Blockbuster.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:35.140]   Blockbuster does have one key advantage over Netflix.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:41.700]   Every month you get two of those free video game or movie coupons.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   So like it's for people, if you can't wait for your movie, go to the store and rent for
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.700]   free.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.940]   You know, I got a DVD in my curious box.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:50.940]   No.
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:51.940]   Right.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.180]   So if you want games, it's Blockbuster.
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.300]   Or, I think Netflix needs to start renting games.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.020]   There are a number of game rental services.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.020]   Game flies.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.020]   Game flies really great.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.020]   Oh, I won't stop.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.020]   It should be all.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.020]   I am so lazy.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.260]   I hate the idea of going to a Blockbuster and walking around one.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:08.260]   Yeah, no.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.260]   I don't want to do that.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.260]   What?
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.260]   You know, mail it off.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.260]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.020]   I think that's one of the, maybe that's what they should have patented is that really
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.820]   what people don't like is about movie stores.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.820]   It's not so much lazy.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:19.820]   It's just, it's like too much.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.020]   And you got to look at every box and you can't really decide what you want.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.700]   And then you get to fight with your wife over, should I get this?
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.900]   Do you want to, do you want 50 last dates or do you want?
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.100]   I think it's better to do it on Netflix.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.340]   Because now I get to fight with my wife.
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.340]   She wants control of the queue.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.340]   She does.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.180]   Who has control of the queue in your house?
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.180]   I have the guy argue over the queue.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.180]   He has control of the queue.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.180]   See?
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.660]   And just, just today some dumb movie showed up.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.660]   Yep.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.660]   It's the equivalent of the remote.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:44.660]   Wait, wait.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.660]   Who has control of the queue in your house?
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.860]   No, we both do the queue.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:50.860]   You both do the queue?
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:51.860]   Do you have to be honest?
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.860]   No, it's actually, yeah.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   He has control of the queue.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.060]   But I am too lazy to go in.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.660]   I mean, I'm pretty sure I could add to the queue, but I would have to go there.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.660]   Like go to the computer.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.660]   No.
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.860]   So, we have a, we have a five-year-old.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.860]   I think that we're just-
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.860]   That's who has control of the queue.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.860]   No, no, no, no.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.860]   Well, we have a couple of like things in there for her.
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.860]   I think we're just so exhausted.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.140]   The last thing we're going to fight about is if in the event we get enough time to watch
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.140]   and review, you know, by the way, one of those people that have been sitting there
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.220]   for a long time, three dusty red envelopes sitting on the fire mind.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.620]   I'm Netflix's best customer.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.540]   It's been at least five months since I've sent one back.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.540]   They love you.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.540]   They love you.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.820]   And they throttle, and they throttle Molly because Molly and her husband are going to
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.820]   be like that.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   That's true.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:32.820]   TV.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.820]   So isn't that, wait a minute.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   I just, I want to point this out.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.820]   We all five of us are Netflix customers.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   Actually, I'm not.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.820]   Oh, you're not.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   You're not.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   You need to record my local video rental.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   Good man.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   You probably live near a cool one and not some crowded one.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.340]   You've arrived to the, really, the place I go to is in the middle of San Francisco.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.340]   It's a pain in the ass here.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.340]   Which one is there?
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.340]   It's actually a tower video.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.340]   It's up on Twin Peaks.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.340]   It's a Irving.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   It's a Irving.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.340]   Nine, the mission, too.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.340]   No, well, ninth and Irving is great, like, live video, live videos.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.340]   Yeah, live videos.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.700]   To go to that, we have to commit yourself to sort of a 45-minute parking.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.100]   You have to park eight blocks away, and then you have to walk back.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.260]   You have to fight through.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:06.660]   They also have the really, like, the classic snarky video people who are like, they end
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.820]   up a video and they look at it, and they're like, "Oh, there's so many other things you
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:10.820]   can do."
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.980]   Yeah, they're all special experience.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.020]   Netflix doesn't judge me, and I appreciate it.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.660]   There are four better millage of all of which movies.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.060]   If you're really a fan, you'd know that.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.820]   All right, we're going to wrap.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:23.820]   No, no, no.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.820]   Please.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.820]   Don't look at that.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.820]   Yes, please.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.820]   Do not make me sick.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:29.820]   Don't look at Sondi.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   You're coming from the front.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.900]   I like that kind of a video star.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.660]   One more lightsaber before we go.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.700]   I just have to.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.700]   Look out for Molly.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.780]   It went under the Christmas.
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.700]   All right.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.700]   It's fun.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.220]   I want to thank Yahoo for giving us some space to do this and Podcast Academy in Doug K for
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.700]   letting us be a part of your event because it's really been a lot of fun here.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.700]   I want to thank Jason Callicannis for not coming tonight.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.700]   Was he bad?
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.420]   No, I thought he was great, but apparently the audience was a little annoyed.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:03.420]   You know what's the Brooklyn access?
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.420]   I thought he was great.
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.660]   He usually is, and he has his opinions, and he gets them out there.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.660]   I thought it was still there.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:13.660]   And they go and take one John Dwork at a time as I get to it.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.620]   Anyway, thanks to AOL Radio.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:23.180]   Of course, we're providing us with a bandwidth for this podcast at AOL.com/podcasting.
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:27.780]   And I thank to all of you for letting us take up your precious afternoon hours.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780]   Value of the time.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.780]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.780]   This week in the can.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   [Applause]
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   We'll give the bags.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.780]   [Applause]
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.780]   This one, maybe the characters decide on the line.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:47.780]   This one, we'll get this one, and we'll walk with them.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   This is a craft society.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   This is a craft generation's firm.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.780]   [Applause]
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.780]   This is a craft everywhere.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:02.780]   This is a craft everywhere.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   This was a craft every time.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:07.780]   Thank you all, man.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.780]   This is a craft every time.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.780]   This is the week from now.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.780]   Now our servers are there.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.780]   This is a sweet gantak.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:27.780]   This is a sweet gantak.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:33.780]   This is a sweet gantak.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.780]   This is a sweet gantak.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:40.780]   My friends, my Twits, are you ready?
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   We have a Twit army.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.780]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   I really don't.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.780]   Let me introduce the table mates.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.780]   John C. DeBore.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.780]   Kevin Rose.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.780]   Patrick Norton.
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.780]   David Prager.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:07.780]   Robert Herron.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:11.780]   I got the Twit army behind me.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.780]   This one.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:16.780]   Microsoft poof-rooted.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.780]   David the Kiss-Quinn.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.780]   The night is a good problem.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.780]   David the Kiss-Quinn.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.780]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.780]   David the Kiss-Quinn.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.360]   (upbeat music)
