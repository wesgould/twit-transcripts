[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   This is This Week in Tech, Episode Number 5, for May 15th, 2005.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.800]   "It looks as though we're interested to spend it off in this bottom. This will be 127th. I've been fast the rest of the year, sir."
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.500]   "Oh, if it's not a personal question, are there any women here today?"
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.800]   "And now for something completely different. We are all Twitch now."
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800]   "Flaw down, three, Twitch!"
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.300]   "That's all, yeah."
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.900]   "The topic is, I don't know if anybody's noticed, but Patrick's always got a soda during the show."
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.900]   "What is it you drink? Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi?"
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900]   "No, I'm on Diet Coke."
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900]   "No, I'm on Diet Coke, who says?"
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900]   "No more Dr. Pepper."
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.900]   "You know how much sugar is in a can of regular Coke or Dr. Pepper?"
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.900]   "16."
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900]   "I try the Diet, Dr. Pepper."
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900]   "I can't stand it."
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.900]   "For some reason, I basically, I can drink Diet Coke and I, and now everything else tastes incredibly sweet."
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900]   "Diet and W. Cream Soda."
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.900]   "Yes, that's what they say."
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900]   "It just sounds disgusting to me, Robert, but I'll go with it."
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   "It's better than the regular Cream Soda."
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900]   "Really?"
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.900]   "Does it have caffeine?"
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.900]   "No."
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900]   "How about just some good green tea?"
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.900]   "I actually drink green tea, I actually drink a lot of Irish breakfast tea."
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900]   "Yeah, me too, that's my favorite. Irish breakfast tea."
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900]   "Wow."
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.900]   "The, uh, drink a lot of more tea that I used to, uh, and then I drink a ton of tea."
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900]   "Drink a lot of coffee, too."
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.900]   "Basically, anything with caffeine and it's Patrick's happy."
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.900]   "Yeah, I'm a second generation caffeine abuser, but I'm trying to, you know, try to slowly
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.900]   wien away the majority of the really foul chemicals I've been running through my system."
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900]   "Caffeines, although I want to be, uh, healthy like, Kevin."
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.900]   "Caffeines, that's okay."
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900]   "Dr. Wilde, Jr. here."
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.900]   "Hey, speaking of diets, how are you doing, Yoshi? Have you, uh, kept the weight off? We haven't seen you. I haven't seen you lately, so."
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900]   "No, I've been, I've been pretty slack, and I'm not lately."
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.900]   "Uh-oh, that's, that's what, uh, that's what that married life's going to do for you. You're going to just fatten right up."
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   "Yeah, yeah, I need to have two something about that."
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.900]   "We need, I need, you need to get your level up too. I can, you just really not very loud. I don't know what, what, maybe it's the microphone you're using, but it's just not."
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900]   "It's just not loud."
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900]   "Yeah, you can contest that for a week louder."
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   "Yeah, put it right next to your mouth. Talk right into my, yeah."
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   "I was just keeping it awake because I have a, have a breathing in to it with my nose."
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900]   "Well, that, that's a problem too."
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.900]   "Nothing's perfect here."
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900]   "Well, what, now you haven't gained it all back, have you, Yoshi?"
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900]   "I've gained a good amount back later."
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.900]   "Oh, well you've, it'll come back off."
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900]   "It's, it's stress isn't it?"
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900]   "I'm like, I'm liking to call it sympathy weight."
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   "Oh yes, because your partner is gaining a little bit too. How far along is she?"
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.900]   "Four months."
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   "Oh, that's great. How exciting. Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?"
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900]   "We actually find out Tuesday."
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.900]   "Alright, we'll announce it here on the Twitcast. There will also be a big announcement soon from Kevin Rose I believe, but we'll save that for later."
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.900]   "Kevin's having a baby."
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.900]   "Kevin's having a baby." "He's gonna be the first."
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.900]   "By myself, yeah."
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.900]   "Yeah."
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   "They're not the hack."
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   "Yeah."
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   "Talk about a mob."
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900]   "It's a dark tip right there."
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900]   "Romeocate yourself."
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900]   "The home cloning kit."
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   "Hey, we want to thank all of the people who have been supporting this cast. The response has been phenomenal.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   I'm not really able to get great statistics on how many downloads I, the only, I can track a little bit of it.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.900]   I know the choral downloads is around 41,000 in the last five days, six days.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   The BitTorrent, I believe, but I'm not sure is around 80,000."
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900]   "Wow."
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   "And there are others as well, but I think I can safely say that the very conservative estimate would be about 125,000 downloads of the episode for our last episode."
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   "Wow."
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.900]   "And that's pretty amazing."
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   "Really cool."
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   "I want to thank everybody who voted for us on podcast alley, you know, without even, most bit cast petition their listeners to vote.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   And I'd never paid any attention to it. I'm not into these beauty contests.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   But somebody posted it on podcast alley and within two days we were number one.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   And that's right now, that's about the only popularity contest or ratings at all, any podcast guest.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   So we thank everybody who voted.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.900]   You get to vote once a month. So I guess we'll start the plea next month to vote again.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   But thank you for putting us on top.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.900]   Basically, we appreciate it not because we want to be number one, but because we want as many people as possible to know about what we're doing.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   So that really, really helps.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.900]   If you haven't contributed and you'd like to, on the front page of our website thisweekintech.com, there are donation buttons.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   That tip jar helps us along. In fact, the first thing we're going to do, and it should happen by next week, is go out and buy some better equipment.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.900]   Because I know the audio quality is starting to get worse and worse as we add.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.900]   Every time we add another person in, we get a little fuzzy here.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.900]   Well, David Prager and Roger Chang are going to come by next week.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900]   Roger's down at E3 and he'll give us an E3 update.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   So we've, what we're going to, I think what we're going to end up doing is taping everybody locally.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.900]   Everybody will have a Marantz, a Copac flash recorder and a good microphone.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.900]   We'll do it as we're doing it now on Skype.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:33.900]   But you won't hear the Skype version. You'll hear the high quality recording version, which I will laboriously piece together into the wee hours of the morning.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.900]   So that's where your donations are going, the first round, and we appreciate it very much.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.900]   And I think you will appreciate it when you hear how much better the Twitcast sounds.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.900]   So we get to the news of the day, ladies and gentlemen, starting off with some security updates.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.340]   Patrick Norton, I saw there was updates for Firefox. Is Firefox still, can it still like
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.900]   claim to be the safest browser out there?
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:07.900]   Well, it's a really interesting question. There's basically, there's pretty hefty updates for Firefox, Mozilla Firefox, which certainly the favorite browser around here, I think.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.900]   And Apple plugged a pretty big hole in iTunes.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:23.900]   Now, it was kind of an odd hole for the iTunes 4.8 updates, where they basically plugged the vulnerability with MPEG-4 file parsing, which is a phrase I really have difficulty saying.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   What does it mean? That's the question.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   Yeah, well, a malicious MPEG-4 could be used. Basically, it could trigger a buffer overflow exploit.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.900]   And then, which is the really fun part, is they could actually remote control the system after doing that.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:51.900]   So the iTunes update patches that hole. Don't know as much about the one for Mozilla 1.4, but I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:01.900]   Okay, Mozilla is safe. Well, you know what, Mozilla, if you go to Mozilla.org/security, you pretty much have the entire list of security alerts and announcements,
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.900]   including a complete list of known vulnerabilities in previous Mozilla products.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:15.900]   You know, and the security advisory, unless I'm completely wrong here, the security advisory went up May 8th, and the patch went up May 11th.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:23.900]   Some columnists, though, have used this list. They look at this list and say, "Look, Mozilla is a Swiss cheese.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   Why are people saying they're safe?" I don't disagree completely.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:33.900]   The problem is not security holes. The problem is a day-to-day issue of spyware using VBScript and ActiveX to infate your system.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.900]   And, you know, unless you add that to Firefox, with a plug-in, you don't have it.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:44.900]   Right. Well, what was the numbers, Yoshi, what were the numbers you found from...
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.900]   It was 21 Firefox exploits versus 13 IE exploits.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.900]   But I think part of that goes to the fact that more and more people are using Firefox,
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.900]   so people that want to develop exploits are going to focus on what more people are on.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   Yeah, I still use... I feel safer with Firefox. I'm sorry. Maybe I'm foolish, but I just seems like it's much, much safer.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.900]   Well, I just like the fact that I'm better.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   I agree. And I think that there's going to be nightly builds. If there's a serious vulnerability that comes out there,
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.900]   there's always the builds that you can go and get if you want to patch it right away.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   Whereas with IE, you have to wait until Microsoft officially releases an update.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.900]   I have to tell you that Firefox use on my sites is now like three to one over IE.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.900]   Only about one in five users is using Internet Explorer.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.900]   Almost all of them are using Firefox or Safari or some other browser, or the K-Brazer.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.900]   Nobody uses IE on my site. And of course, it's a geek site, and I've been plugging Firefox for months.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   Forever.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.900]   Yeah. But I mean, well, am I wrong?
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.900]   And then, should I say, go back to Internet Explorer?
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.900]   No, I prefer Firefox. I think it's a far superior browser.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   Yeah. I don't think these exploits are anything to be worried about at this point.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.900]   All right. Who watched MTV Thursday night?
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.900]   For the big Xbox 360? Yeah.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.900]   I actually do not have cables still, so I have to put a steal of little videos of it online.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   I did, but I downloaded it from the torrent sites right after it came out.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.900]   Exactly.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.900]   So what do you think?
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.900]   Three? No, I was not impressed.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:25.900]   No, wait a minute. Now, three power PC processors plus a 500 MHz ATI processor, 20 gig hard drive.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.900]   It's going to be the most powerful computer in your house, isn't it?
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.900]   Until the PS3 comes out. I was impressed when I saw the spec sheet.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.900]   The games that they've shown, the little clips that they've shown so far don't really look all that impressive to me yet.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.900]   But, you know, that's just the way it is.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.900]   Anytime a new console comes out, the games obviously don't take full potential of all the hardware that's available.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.900]   So we'll have to wait a while until we really see some cool games coming out for it.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.900]   But I like the way that they're actually going to be tying into some things like music stores so you can download music.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.900]   They're actually making this device for the hacked Xboxes are now.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.900]   So in other words, they're giving it media capabilities.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.900]   You can run music and pictures and all that stuff.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.900]   Can you copy your games of the hard drive?
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.900]   No.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.900]   No.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.900]   That's the main reason I hacked my Xbox.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.900]   Not until it hacked.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.900]   I don't see that being very far off either.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.900]   Really? You think they'll crack it?
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.900]   Oh, come on. I mean, you know people are just antsy to get their hands on it so they can crack it.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   Bunny Wong is just to the man.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.900]   Bunny's just waiting.
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.900]   I mean, do you remember when the Xbox premiered Leo?
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.900]   I mean, at an interview with like the lead engineer and he was like, "Nobody's ever going to be able to crack this."
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.900]   And Bunny did it in a day.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.900]   You know, yeah, it was just like, "Uh-huh, oops."
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.900]   But they did some dumb things and they probably learned from their mistakes and I would think that it'd be more secure.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.900]   I don't know if they did dumb things, but I think it's like a...
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   I don't know. Kevin, maybe you can talk about this, but it seems like there's a terminal like...
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.900]   We've patched everything.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.900]   You know, I mean, except for stuff like where they've just been sloppy, hodens up.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.900]   There seems to be a lot of, "Okay, we've thought of everything we could think of."
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.900]   And then five minutes later, somebody thinks of a third thing.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.900]   Right.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.900]   Well, they did a pretty good job because you got to...
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:12.900]   If you think about the way that you had to go about hacking the Xbox, there was some software-based hacks which were a pain to get running.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.900]   But overall, I mean, unless you went with a hardware-based solution, it was rather difficult to hack your Xbox.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   Yeah, Microsoft can't care that much.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:27.900]   I mean, how many of the millions of people bought Xboxes took the time to solder in or open the box up, put a new chip in and make all those modifications?
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.900]   Well, it was great market research for them, too.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   And then we were planning out what people wanted.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.900]   And now they put it into the next generation.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   Xbox 360.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.900]   That's a very good point.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   Exactly.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.900]   Hey, this actually would be a good time to drop in.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.900]   We have lots of questions from our audience.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.900]   And I have one that's Apropos.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.900]   I just want to encourage people to continue sending questions.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.900]   We have some new ways to do it.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.900]   We have a phone number you can call now, 206-339-TWIT.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.900]   And I want to... that's through K7.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.900]   I want to thank one of our listeners who set that up for us.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.900]   It's a Seattle number, so it will be a long-distance call.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900]   I should warn you.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.900]   If you want to use Skype, you can also... we have Skype voicemail.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.900]   You can go to the Skype handle is This Week in Tech.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   This Week in Tech.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.900]   And you can ask us a question there.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:22.900]   Of course, you can continue to do what all of these folks did, which is email us your questions to questions@thisweekintech.com.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.900]   Here is our first of, if I can get them in, 20 questions today.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.900]   This is Aaron from Skowhegan, Maine.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.900]   I'm in the computer lab in my university at the moment, so I don't have a mic, so I'm using text-to-speech synthesis.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.900]   I wanted to ask Kevin about his overclocked toothbrush.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.900]   I am a software guy, just getting into hardware hacking.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:50.900]   Can any of you guys rec common some resources to learn about wiring, soldering, etc.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.900]   Websites are great, but book rec commendations are welcome as well.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   I would greatly appreciate it.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:03.900]   Thank you so much, and I look forward to sending another question in my actual voice sometime down the road.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   Peace.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.900]   I would not. I think that voice is pretty good, don't you?
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.900]   That's pretty great.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.900]   So soldering recommended.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.900]   Would you...
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   Shall we play a game?
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.900]   He wants a rec commendation for soldering.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.900]   I mean, this is one for you, Yoshi. You're the solder.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.900]   You're the solder kid.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.900]   I learned pretty much all my skills from Yoshi, so...
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.900]   Can you take this one?
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.900]   King of soldering.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.900]   There's a lot of resources for that.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   I'll throw a few up on. I'll post a blog with a few links to it.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.900]   That'd be great.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.900]   There might happen to be a little PDF that has the entire Navy soldering guidelines and criteria and all that good stuff.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.900]   Is that legal?
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   What the...
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.900]   Would that be a legal PDF?
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.900]   I don't know. I got to look into that before I...
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.900]   I don't want to post it.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.900]   I don't want to post something that's illegal.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.900]   Well, if it's just a Navy...
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.900]   Just a circle from Google for how to solder.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.900]   There's the basic soldering guide.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.900]   There's actually a couple of good ones.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.900]   Actually, the robot store has a really good one. It's in PDF format.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   Because that's... Yeah, sure.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.900]   You have to do a lot of soldering if you're building a robot.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.900]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.900]   That was a tough thing, though, back when you had to solder the Xbox chip in.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   I know you ruined one motherboard. That was a tough solder.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.900]   It was an extra motherboard that...
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.900]   I think we just had one bad chip.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.900]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.900]   What I messed up soldering was actually trying to do Mod-EPS2 and not the Xbox.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.900]   I found it was pretty easy.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.900]   Oh, really?
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.900]   It was two of the really difficult...
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.900]   No, I'm the one that trash the Xbox.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   I ruined one.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.900]   Well, there's one solder point, the little D0 solder point, that is so tiny.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.900]   It's just like near impossible to pull off.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.900]   You don't have to worry about that anymore, no, because they have the solderless mod chips, though, right?
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.900]   Yeah, they use the Pogo lens and it's just really easy.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.900]   Now, you just screwdriver and you can do it.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.900]   Makes it a lot easier.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.900]   But maybe you don't have to. Just get a 360.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.900]   Did Microsoft send one of the same...
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.900]   The big thing on soldering, though, is practice.
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.900]   Practice, practice, practice, practice.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.900]   Don't practice on your kid's sister, though.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   Go find some junk stuff and just practice soldering on it.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.900]   You'll get it in a couple hours, really.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.900]   It's not that difficult.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.900]   It just takes a little bit of a touch.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.900]   Whoever wins Patrick's box of crap is going to get plenty of practice.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900]   By the way, I know...
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.900]   No, we haven't given the crap away and I apologize.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.900]   I'm slowly going through.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.900]   You guys could help.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.900]   Let me see how many it was.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.900]   It was like 2,500 name entries.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.900]   And I want to really give everybody a shot, but you can't read too many at once.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.900]   I'm still slowly parsing through all those.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.900]   Can I do it next week?
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.900]   Can we nuts the winner next week?
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.900]   The good news about delaying it is we keep getting better prizes to give away.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.900]   We have some additional prizes.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.900]   Patrick's box of crap gets bigger every day.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.900]   Hey, I found links to NASA videos on how to solder.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.900]   Oh, cool.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.900]   If you can solder in space.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.900]   Did you see the NASA video of the...
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.900]   Actually, it wasn't in space.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.900]   It was one of those zero-g plane rides that they do.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.900]   The roller coaster plane rides of water balloon popping.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.900]   That was cool.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.900]   I'll put a link to that on the website too.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.900]   Item number two.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.900]   Yoshi, you want to talk about Battlestar Galactica?
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.900]   Are you a Battlestar Galactica fan?
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.900]   I'm a huge Battlestar Galactica fan.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.900]   I was reading about how everyone...
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.900]   It was completely downloaded before it evens out here.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.900]   It actually increased their ratings.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.900]   Discovery channel...
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.900]   Sci-Fi channel, care less.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.900]   They're like great, more ratings.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.900]   Isn't that great?
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.900]   I think it's a real...
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.900]   To me, it's a real indicator to traditional broadcasters that maybe web distribution is not a bad thing
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.900]   and they shouldn't worry so much about it because if people like it, they're going to spread the word.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.900]   What do you have to say about that, Kevin?
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.900]   I know you're a big believer in...
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   Of course, you don't even think you need the broadcast part. Just put it on the net.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.900]   Yeah, I mean, if you're putting up content that people want to see, I'm really into the whole online.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.900]   I can't wait for IPTV to hit it a few years from now.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.900]   You know, with services like Google and all these different video uploads,
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   services that are coming, it's just going to get more and more exciting every day.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.900]   More people are creating content for web distribution. It's awesome.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.900]   There's a new open source source project called Broadcast Machine.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.900]   If you've seen this, it's kind of a neat idea.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.900]   It uses BitTorrent to in effect create a television station.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.900]   So you'll be running BitTorrent on your server and it provides a front end.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.900]   It's specifically for video. It's from the participatoryculture.org.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.900]   If you want to know more about it.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.900]   And I think it's a really cool idea. They just started it.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900]   I mean, they're in beta. They just put the first beta up.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.900]   How does it work?
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.900]   Exactly.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.900]   Well, like subscribing to the feeder.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.900]   No, basically it creates a web page. It's using PHP in the back end. It does BitTorrent.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.900]   So you'll go, it'll have, when you go to the page, let's say Kevin, you had, you know,
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.900]   four or five episodes of a TV show.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.900]   You would create the feeds using the software.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.900]   People would go to the page. They would see a directory listing, just like a TV guide of the shows.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.900]   They'd click on it and it would start playing.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.900]   But instead of playing directly from your server, it's playing via the BitTorrent.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.900]   BitTorrent is really a solution for this bandwidth issue. It's remarkable.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.900]   You can't do streaming with the servers.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.900]   You can't.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   Well, you can't. No, it won't be a live show. It would be a storage show.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   But it looks like streaming from the point of view of the viewer.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.900]   But as it could be kind of for delivery.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.900]   It's as good as we can do right now with our limited bandwidth.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.900]   Exactly. And it solves the issue of free bandwidth versus, you know, I mean, I think it's a...
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.900]   As anybody has been following the MPA announcement that they're suing...
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   Yeah. They put two-
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.900]   They're taking action against television show theme.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   Yeah. They put BTEF net off about eight, six or seven trackers are gone now.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.900]   It's going to hit stuff like that one, video or services like that, that are like,
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   "Oh, you'll, you know, get all your sites. You want it automatically.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.900]   Mine's it for you." So it's...
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.900]   They're seeing that there's a lot of activity there.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.900]   But I think they should really see the positive side of that.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.900]   And you exploited as a promotional tool.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.900]   Absolutely. Well, that's the thing.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.900]   Battle-Stargolact is really proven that you can do that.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.900]   But that's also a geek show.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.900]   Sure.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.900]   Could you do it with, you know, a mainstream show?
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.900]   Could you, I mean, would that, could you do that or...
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.900]   Well, with the mainstream show, I think you're going to have less people likely to download it anyway because
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.900]   unless their fans are typically geeks, they're not going to be bit torrenting everything.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   But that's, you know, we're seeing a bunch of different services, Yosh.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   I'm sure that you've seen that are just getting better and better for little front-end so that people don't know
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.900]   how to understand how to subscribe to feeds and things like that so they can just instantly get that content.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.900]   That's true. But I think people will still watch it.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   Because it's kind of a thing. Like, you see something good.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.900]   You are going to tell people about it.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.900]   And myself, I see something bad. I usually just delete it and forget about it.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.900]   Yeah. I mean, it's the same thing with music for me.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.900]   Sometimes I'll download music that I didn't pay for and I'll enjoy it and go out and buy the CD or buy the CD online.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:59.900]   Yeah. I think what's interesting about this lawsuit is they're going after stuff that until it's available in DVD,
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:05.900]   which is X number of years in the future, you know, there's no way to buy.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.900]   I mean, this is all, you know, regular, you know, cable or broadcast television that they're going after.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.900]   I mean, shun TV, zone of tracker. I can't even, I never know how to say BTEFNet.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.900]   Well, it's BitTorrent for EFNet, which is an IRC.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.900]   Yeah. You know, I think...
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.900]   High-five classics, TV.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   You've got to talk to these guys and you'll realize that they see blood.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.900]   They're furious. It's not, it's an emotional reaction.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.900]   It's not a rational business decision. The record industry and the movie industry are livid.
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.900]   And you try to talk to them and they say, "But they're stealing our stuff!"
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   They turn red in the face. Smoke comes out of their ears.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   They're not thinking, you know, long term by any means.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   Well, they think they're thinking long term.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   Just, "Clickman's quote, "Every television series depends on other markets.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.900]   "Syndication, international sales to earn back the enormous investment required to produce the comedies and dramas
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   "We all enjoy, and those markets are substantially hurt when that content is stolen."
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.900]   Well, that's the debate. Are they hurt or not?
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.900]   Good question. I mean, I don't think so.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   I don't think so. I mean, with all the MP3 downloads and apps and whatnot, it didn't really affect the sales of CDs.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   I mean, they tried to say that it hurt them and hurt them and yet the CD sales still went up.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   In fact, I think you can make a good case that it's just promotional. It has a promotional value.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:30.900]   People are still going to go to movies. You can't duplicate the movie theater experience in a download.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.900]   Yeah, but I noticed a lot of movie theaters dying out here in San Francisco.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.900]   Well, maybe, I don't know. Is the movie business hurting?
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.900]   You know, that's DVDs, Patrick. That's not, that's just the success of DVDs.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.900]   Of course, maybe that does make the,
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   I actually, I think it's got more to do with like the three multiplexes that have opened in the past five years.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.900]   That's true. Everybody's going there. Robert's single screen movies are gone.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   Robert spent some time hanging out at the Metreon this week.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   Yes.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   And he sees the future of home theater. Tell us about it.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   Oh, I just had a chance to attend a premiere on Thursday night last week and TI was one of the sponsors.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   Texas instrument being the company that does the DLP chips that are used in a variety of reprejection and from projection display systems.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   They have a brand new theater or cinema tech basically that offers 2048 by 1080p resolution on the big screen now.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:34.900]   Which is a little bit greater than 1080p at 24 frames per second and it looks absolutely magnificent.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.900]   Now is that a, is that a, it's not a home technology. That'll be a movie theater technology.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.900]   Well, I mean, obviously it's a, what is it? A six kilowatt lamp.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   40,000 dollar screen. So it's, it's, it's definitely a large venue format.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.900]   Home theater, home heating system.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.900]   And these are state of the art three chip projectors that are used in digital theaters.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   But the big difference is, especially with this year is this quote unquote the two K chip, the 2048 chip.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.900]   Last year we were looking at 1280 by 720 for DLP in theaters.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.900]   And at screen sizes of 70 feet, I'll be honest with you, you saw a little bit of aliasing on nice curved surfaces.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.900]   And artifacts such as that really kind of took me out of it.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.900]   Or if you sat close enough to the screen, you'd even get a little bit of the screen door effect where you could see the individual pixels.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:27.900]   Yeah. And this, this move to 1080p is another one point roughly 1.2 million pixels.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.900]   And it looked fluid.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:35.900]   It was just, it was arguably one of the best displays I've ever seen in my life in terms of uniformity and just clarity.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.900]   So how long before you think this technology will start trickling its way into the consumer technology now?
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.900]   1080p projectors are available now in the, in the consumer side.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.900]   You're, you're talking $20,000 plus.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:47.900]   So what about its content?
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:53.900]   Content, you know, for me it's more about just more pixels, I think is always better.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.900]   If you have a display with more pixels, you can get away with closer viewing distances.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.900]   I'm more of a-
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.900]   Robert, from what?
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.900]   No, go ahead.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.900]   From what you've heard is, is 1080p, is that going to be HDD or Blu-ray?
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.900]   Are they going to actually offer 1080p DVDs to butt purchase?
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.900]   You know, nothing yet from the movie studios.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.900]   They're still focused on 720p 1080i.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   One, it's a lot less data right off the bat.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   Or you're going to, I probably see a lot of compressed formats, H.264 or Windows Media 9 encoding.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.900]   But the other, other nice aspect of this too is just, it's a digital delivery system.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   So whether you're the first person to see it on opening day or, you know, five, six hundred showings in,
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.900]   that quality is just perfect from point on.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.900]   That's a problem.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.900]   But these three chip systems, like you see in big venues, are pretty special.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.900]   And it happened in the movie that I saw was the new Star Wars movie.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   Oh, wait a minute, you didn't mention that.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.900]   So now I've seen all three Star Wars of the latest trilogy and a DLP.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.900]   And it's gotten better every time.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.900]   And that's the other, oh, one other point too.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.900]   The last two Star Wars movies, the attack or revenge of the Sith and the previous one,
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.900]   were both shot digitally in 1080p formats.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   So you saw a direct digital master in effect.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   It's as good as theoretically it can get.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.900]   And it really came off well.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.900]   So how'd you like the movie?
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.900]   It sucked less is what I'm telling you.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.900]   Barely.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.900]   Is there, is Jar Jar in it?
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.900]   Yes, for 15 seconds.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:26.900]   He doesn't say a word.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.900]   Oh, good.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   Me Sonata in the movie.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.900]   All right.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   Oh, God.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.900]   It's Star Wars by the numbers.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.900]   You know, it is the end and it has to tie into, you know, the original Star Wars movie,
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.900]   I guess, episode four.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.900]   So there are some things to be expected.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.900]   But I really, I found no great surprises.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.900]   I found nothing.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.900]   People were saying it's darker.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.900]   It's more serious.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.900]   It's scary.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.900]   Well, compared to the first two.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.900]   Anything without Jar Jar is going to be darker.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.900]   Yeah, but trust me, they've got a few new characters to throw at you.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.900]   Oh, good.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.900]   It's a bit of eye-candy and a lot of CG.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.900]   More Muppets.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   Let me, let's get a question in from one of our Twit listeners.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.900]   Hey everyone.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.900]   I'm Jonathan from New York City.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.900]   I just have a question about the standards war between Blu-ray and high definition DVD.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:27.900]   Honestly, I favor high definition DVD more, particularly because I've never agreed with Sony's ideas of standardizing everything and ever prior to the format.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.900]   We've seen that with A-Track 3 and with the memory stick format.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.900]   My question to you guys is, who do you think will win the format?
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:48.900]   And do you think that there will be a chance or an opportunity to say that both standards might unify into one?
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   Let me know soon.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.900]   It's really good to see you guys back on the Earth.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   Okay, that's it.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.900]   Can we ask you folks if you're going to send us a question to turn off the TV first?
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.900]   All I ask.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.900]   We'll be no unity.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.900]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.900]   Now we heard that there was going to be though, right?
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:14.900]   Yeah, there was top talks of the HD DVD and the Blu-ray converging and then Toshiba denied it and then they announced their new triple layer HD DVD.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.900]   It's up to 45 gigabytes now, so I don't see that as a convergent step.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.900]   You're going to have universal players.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.900]   Are you?
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.900]   Can you do that?
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   I mean, yes, they showed off two and three pickup systems.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.900]   What about the same box?
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.900]   Well, it's got to be much more expensive and complex.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.900]   You only have once it's built.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.900]   As all the engineers say, you build it once.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.900]   That's the expensive part.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.900]   As soon as it's built, they tape them out at cheaper and cheaper costs.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.900]   Okay.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.900]   And they've shown Pioneer had a two pickup system for both formats.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   Somebody else showed off a three pickup system, I believe, for, I want to say original DVD formats as well as burning CDs.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.900]   They can do it all.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:58.900]   They're going to have the multi-format drives because there's no way Sony's going to suddenly say, oh, let's just join forces and co-create a new format that is the best of both worlds.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.900]   How about in the PC?
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:06.900]   Well, we have HD recorders and Blu-ray recorders and they'll have unified just as they did with Plus and Dash.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.900]   It's really going to come down to what they want to support.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:17.900]   And, you know, if Sony makes it so proprietary that it's restrictive to how people want to use it, you know, they're going to shoot themselves like beta.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.900]   But there's going to be a bunch of content that we're not going to be able to get an HD because Sony writes to it.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.900]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   Disney's going with Blu-ray, but Universal's going with HD.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.900]   I mean, they've divided up the world.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   So that's why you have to have a combo.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.900]   You're not going to be able to have -- I mean, the consumer's just going to have to buy one set.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.900]   And they're already looking at future generations of tests, too.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.900]   This is just that first round that the early adopters are paying through the nose for.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.900]   I mean, you can't find a double-layer DVD right now for under six bucks.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.900]   And that's an interim technology.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   That's not -- you know, as soon as HD's out, forget dual-layer.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.900]   Who needs dual-layer?
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.900]   It's over.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.900]   All right.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   I'm going to do my best Bill Gates impression now.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   [COUGHING]
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   I don't think the success of the iPod can continue in the long term.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   However good Apple may be.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   I think you can draw parallels here with the computer.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.900]   Here, too, Apple was once extremely strong with its Macintosh and graphic user interface.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.900]   Like with the iPod today, then lost its position.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   Sour grapes?
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.900]   Well, this is the same person who said they'll never need more than 120K memory.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.900]   I have that somewhere.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   I'll play that for you.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.900]   I think it wasn't even that.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.900]   It was 640K.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.900]   It was like, "You'll never need more than 640K bytes of anybody.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.900]   We'll never need more than that."
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.900]   This is also somebody who's trying to take over the mobile phone business and the mobile
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.900]   operating system market.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   Right.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.900]   Nokia says they're going to be the number one -- not only are they now the number one camera
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   phone company, they're going to be the number one MP3 player company.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.900]   And they're doing a deal with the iTunes music store.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   So.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.900]   The problem is, is that they've got to get the -- you know, been watching the --
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.900]   the whole iPod, iTunes, cell phone debacle over the last couple months.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.900]   And like Motorola's like, "We have the phone.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   We're going to show you the phone.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.900]   We're not going to show you the phone."
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.900]   What happens there?
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.900]   We're not going to show you the phone.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   Well, we're not going to show you the phone because every cell phone carrier in the United
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   States said, "If we don't get a piece, you don't get to --"
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900]   Oh.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   We're not going to let your phone on our network.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   So they just don't have a deal?
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.900]   Well, I think they have it.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.900]   I think it was a great deal where Motorola and Apple were working together.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.900]   But I think they maybe should have cut, you know, Verizon and singular --
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.900]   -- and a little earlier.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.900]   If you don't get them, then you're not going to -- look what happened to the P900, the Sony P900.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.900]   Nobody carries it.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.900]   You can't get it.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   It's 700 bucks.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.900]   Well, that's such a problem now with cell phone companies anyway.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.900]   From company to company, you can't get the phone you want.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   It's -- that's one of my most frustrating things with cell phone companies.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.900]   It's just so hard time believing that mobile phones are going to be like the future of
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   all things audio for us.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.900]   Portable audio.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   Just because I switch mobile phones every six months, I'm not going to want to switch
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.900]   MP3 players every six months.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.900]   I'm looking to get into video type content.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.900]   I know there's going to be a video iPod coming up.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   So I think that -- that device is going to still be there, the separate device from the phone.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, you said something interesting there.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.900]   You know there's going to be a video iPod?
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.900]   Well, I mean, it's only a matter of time.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   With the latest release of iTunes 4.8, they've added the ability to play.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.900]   Videos and download video content.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   Now there's certain albums when you buy them now, they actually come bundled with video.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.900]   Yes.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.900]   So it's only a matter of time before they add a portable little handheld player that plays
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.900]   videos as well and Apple will do better than anybody else.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   And that will be the new rage and everyone will have one of those.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.900]   You go to the iTunes Music Store and try to watch -- if you try to watch the Harry Potter trailer,
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   which just went up this week, by going to apple.com/trailers, what does it do?
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.900]   It launches iTunes.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   But it's interesting because they've definitely built the hooks in, just like Kevin was saying.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   They've also built hooks in for Ogwarpis and WMA.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.900]   They have basically icons in there that don't connect to anything.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.900]   That's interesting.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.900]   It's supposedly the reason they don't have a handheld portable video player.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.900]   So Steve Jobs is against it.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.900]   Well, that's what's -- yeah, no, that's what I was told by an Apple insider.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.900]   He said, "Steve doesn't think people will want to watch portable video."
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   Now, Steve could change his mind.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.900]   I think there is probably a good reason.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.900]   What's this deal we've also said that they weren't going to have a flash-based iPod.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.900]   Right.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.900]   And then they came out with one.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:26.900]   Yeah, better to be a pirate than joined an avian to go over the Macintosh project in the dark apple campus.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   Steve also told me I was a lousy spiker, but that's another man in town.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.900]   So what's this --
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.900]   That's right, you played volleyball with him, didn't you?
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.900]   I did, yeah.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   This is my one good story in my whole life.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.900]   And he's very competitive.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.900]   I was on his team and I didn't play well enough, I think.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   So what's the deal with this rumor about the iTunes PlayStation 3 then?
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:53.900]   Yeah, that's really interesting because in gadget is reporting that with some announcements
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.900]   hopefully coming on Monday or Tuesday from the PlayStation group, or the Sony group,
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   that there will be connectivity to the iTunes music store.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.900]   So when you hook up your PS3, you'll be able to download music just like it was a computer
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   from the iTunes music store and also sync it with your iPod.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.900]   And I know that Microsoft has announced that they're going to be doing that with their music store.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.900]   It only makes sense, especially with the last keynote of Steve Jobs here at Macworld.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   You heard him say, Leo, how he was really interested in getting more even further in bed with Sony.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   Yeah, they just slipped that in at the end and clearly there was something that works.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.900]   Well, what about the PSP?
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.900]   Could he put -- I mean, the PSP plays music, the PSP plays video.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.900]   Yeah, it has a very nice screen, so that might be a little bit of a partnership there too.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   I don't know.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   I think it'll be smart for Tony to get in and say, yeah, we want the iTunes store,
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.900]   which is the biggest store. Everyone goes there.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:47.900]   It's pretty standard. I mean, parents give their kids allowances on it, that kind of thing.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   But Sony has been so proprietary in the past, it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   Another question from the Twit -- Now, we're the Twits, right?
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.900]   What are we going to call the Twit listeners?
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.900]   The Twit Army.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.900]   The Twit Army. Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   Hi guys, I have two questions.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   First, I keep hearing about and even seen 300GB files containing a full 42-minute episode from TV.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.900]   You even mentioned them in a prior show.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:19.900]   These files look great, but when I record digital TV myself or free to TV, the best possible compression I get is about 700MB for 25 minutes.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.900]   I've taken digital transport streams, raw TV, hardware in Pig 2, etc. and tried trends coding.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.900]   But always, when I get anywhere near the 350MB for 40 minutes, it looks dreadful.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   I've tried a few multi-stage conversion using commercial and free encoders, but the results suck.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   What I would really like to be given is a working approach using any software or hardware you care to mention
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.900]   that gets such good results when encoding video to these low-bit rates.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.900]   How do you guys do it? That's by the way, Philip, who listens to us in Australia.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.900]   You're an expert on this now, Kevin.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   Welcome to my world. I'm having the same problems right now.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   It is truly a process to get the right bit rate and the right resolution and the right quality.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.900]   You really have to sit there and tweak it. There is no one tool that does it perfectly.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   I've found. I've used everything across the board.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   I've docked from Dr. Divex to H.264 to Windows Media, XVID, Theora.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.900]   I'm using all these different formats and trying all these different.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.900]   There's some open source-based encoders. We're doing some in Linux.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.900]   I'm just now starting to get the hang of it, and it is quite a process.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.900]   I need to write up in articles when I need to after we get this figured out.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   Doesn't everybody mostly use Divex now?
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:37.900]   Well, XVID, I think, is probably one of the most popular formats now that I'm sitting on.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   That's the open source-divix.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   There are no set-top players that you can buy right now, but I'm just aware of seating.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.900]   There is seating quality. Narrows and coder, and they're near digital with their audio,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.900]   which gives you MPEG-4 audio and video. It is one of my favorites that I use for my personal backup.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.900]   But you're not getting...
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.900]   There are DVD players that play Divex files now.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   There are DVD players that play Divex files.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.900]   There's one that plays at X-Fit as well.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.900]   But there's nothing that plays near digital.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.900]   You can actually export to MPEG-4 compatible file as well as a PSP compatible file.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.900]   There is no application I'm aware of right now that lets you encode to the full resolution of the PSP,
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.900]   unfortunately, when you're playing it from a memory stick.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   You actually put it slightly smaller, which is a weird quirk.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.900]   So I'm hoping somebody hacks that.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   Well, this is a new product.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.900]   That will make it the most incredible, I think, portable video player out there.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.900]   I'll have to say though, Leo, so far, if he wants a recommendation of what to encode with,
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.900]   I just would recommend getting QuickTime Pro right now and just kicking it out at H.264
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.900]   and just playing around with a bit rates there.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.900]   It's so easy to use and it creates great results every time.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   You have to buy QuickTime Pro right. That's $30.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.900]   Correct.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.900]   Oh, I want to clarify something I said last week too regarding the compression at 350 megabytes.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   They were starting with HD feeds, but there was a reduction in resolution.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.900]   So we weren't maintaining an HD resolution.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   And if you did stretch it out to, say, 50 inches on a big screen display, it would get a little soft,
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.900]   but you wouldn't see any macro blocking, per se, or anything like that.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   Another question. We have international listeners all over the world.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   That's what I like the best about this.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.900]   I mean, anybody can listen to the show.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.900]   Here's one that came to us from the UK.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.900]   Right now this is Ashley.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.900]   Hey guys, Ashley here from Brighton, England.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.900]   First of all, I just wanted to thank you for all of the stuff that you do.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.900]   There's very little in the way of tech news here in the UK.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.900]   I'm looking to build my own PC and was wondering what set up you guys are all running
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.900]   and what components you would recommend for high-res graphics editing and gaming.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.900]   All right, well, we're going to have to do go around the horn on this.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   Let's start with you, Kevin Rose.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.900]   You're still using a PC or if you're going all Mac?
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   Yeah, no, I have a PC as well. I just built one here about, let's see, a couple months ago.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.900]   I stick with the major brand names.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:04.900]   I have an MSI motherboard. I go to Athlon 64, 3500 Plus.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.900]   I have an ATI card, even though I probably want to go with an Nvidia if I was doing it over again.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:16.900]   Just standard components. I have the 10,000 RPM ID hard drive, which I love extremely fast.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:17.900]   You have the Raptor.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.900]   Yeah, the Raptor.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.900]   That's a great drive.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.900]   I wish it were. It feels like it's not as fast as it seems like it ought to be,
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.900]   but I guess it's better than anything else I could be using.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   How about you, Yoshi? Are you still building PCs?
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.900]   I haven't built a new one lately.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.900]   I'm still running Linux as an OS, but I'm running PCs.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.900]   I have one that's sitting idle.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.900]   I need to get some more hardware for it, but I'm running 6800 Ultra.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.900]   I haven't tried one of the new 512 Ultra's.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   I'm a big AMD fan, though, as far as CPU's.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   I still think for the money they're the best CPU.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.900]   I think we're all in agreement on that.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   Anybody think they'd rather have a Pentium 4, a Prescott?
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.900]   Well, last four systems. I know.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.900]   We're AMD 64s, and they're all awesome.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.900]   They're talking about notebooks that'd rather have a Pentium M.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.900]   What about the Noturion, though? Isn't the Turion?
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.900]   I mean, this new AMD, really the first time they've actually done a real mobile chip,
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.900]   the Turion looks pretty good.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.900]   It's a 64.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.900]   It's hard for me to trust AMD in the mobile market yet.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.900]   I mean, they're just now getting into it with these new chips.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.900]   I know they've been in it for a while, but this is the first true offering
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.900]   that they have that really people are considering to buy,
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.900]   but I'm going to hold off for a little while until I see long-term how their chips are.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   Patrick, Robert, have you seen...
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.900]   Have they brought hyper-threading to a mobile part yet?
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   I don't think so.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:33.900]   Intel?
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.900]   Intel?
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.900]   No, I don't think so.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.900]   No, they aren't.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.900]   Because you don't want...
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.900]   I think that wouldn't mind.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.900]   You don't want that many transistors in there.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:42.900]   It just consumes energy.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.900]   But this person was talking about building their own system, right?
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.900]   Last four, I put together based on shuttles boxes with pre-wired motherboards
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   and beautiful case designs.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   And even if you have a basic knowledge of just putting parts together
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.900]   if you're comfortable putting a video card in and a couple of drives.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.900]   Those shuttles look great, don't they?
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.900]   They're awesome.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   They're all serious gaming machines with great video cards or fast hard drives.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.900]   And they're good enough to be media PCs in the living room too,
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.900]   I think they look fairly quiet.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.900]   Probably also, it's probably worth pointing out that if you're not going to play video games,
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.900]   you don't need a fast graphics card.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.900]   Because I've seen some people have video systems specked out for video editing,
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.900]   pure video editing systems, and people are trying to tell them to buy a $550 graphics card.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.900]   And it's like, "Well, why is that there?"
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.900]   "Well, it's the best graphics card that's available!"
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.900]   And it's, "Well, it's not going to make you edit video any faster."
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   So the high-end video card is really only for gaming.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   It won't help you with video editing.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.900]   Will it help you with media center recording TV shows?
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   Is there any benefit?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.900]   No.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.900]   There's some benefit to getting a better graphics card when you're doing video editing.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.900]   We use a plug-in called Magic Bullet that is actually coming out with a version
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   that will take advantage of the 6800's GPU to render everything faster.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.900]   But, yeah, like Pat said, I haven't seen that.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.900]   This is just now coming out.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   That's specialized.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.900]   Yeah, it's Magic Bullet, so it works with Premiere Pro and Final Cut.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   But if you have a 6800 GPU, it'll use that to actually increase the speed of rendering.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.900]   Well, some other things like on Macintosh, especially with programs like Motion.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.900]   Magic Bullet is $800.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.900]   Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.900]   Hey!
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.900]   On programs like Motion, though, you have to have a nicer video card
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.900]   because it uses so much of the video card and the rendering that you do
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.900]   and using the program that it just makes it unbearable.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.900]   What it's really using is the VRAM.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.900]   You want 128 megs of VRAM or more, right?
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.900]   I mean, I don't know if it's using the GPU particularly.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.900]   It's using the...
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   Oh, it is.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.900]   I actually, yeah, I interviewed one of the founders here just like a week ago
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.900]   and he was telling me it's using the GPU as the main processing core.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:50.900]   You're talking about motion?
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.900]   You're talking about the CPU.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.900]   You're talking about motion or Magic Bullet?
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.900]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.900]   I was talking about Magic Bullet.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:56.900]   Okay.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.900]   Video card companies right now are also waiting on an update to direct decks
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   from Microsoft that will enable pixel shader usage with video processing.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:09.900]   And they have some really interesting features, especially regarding HD rendering.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.900]   When you're talking Windows Media 9 HD in particular, it's a CPU hog.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.900]   It requires pretty outrageous systems and they'll be able to soon take that pixel shader hardware
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.900]   and use it for the decode process and they're claiming 50% CPU reduction.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   So we'll have some good stuff there coming up this summer.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.900]   We were talking about hyper-threading and multicore and the cell.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   We've got a question from Tristan.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:36.900]   Hey guys, this is Tristan from Chicago and I just want to say it's great to hear you all together again.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   My question is a question about the future of computing.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   I think it's becoming very apparent that single core processors with ridiculously high clock speeds
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.900]   are coming to the end of their lives.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   Now with multicore and cell processors coming into the fray of things,
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.900]   as well as the new quasi asynchronous cores from fulcrum and handshake,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.900]   I'm wondering what kind of technology you think the mainstream CPUs of the future will be using.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.900]   Light.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.900]   Light.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.900]   You really think optical?
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.900]   Oh, of course.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.900]   That's the entire Intel already showed off of prototype.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.900]   So it's just when you get started getting to transistor densities that they're looking at,
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.900]   you can't make that very big without dissipating the heat.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.900]   And I'm sure there'll be great technology developments regarding how you dissipate that heat,
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.900]   but just simply making that switch to light and the way they're able to switch to that,
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   there is no heat per se when you're dealing with moving packets of light rather than electrons.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   But that's way far out, right?
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   We're talking 10 years.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.900]   I'm willing to bet the military already has something.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   Really?
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   They seem to get something 10 to 15, 20 years ahead of everyone else.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   For right now, I think the cell processor is very interesting.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.900]   This is the heart of the PS3.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.900]   Sony developed it with Toshiba and IBM and I think there's some really cool stuff.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.900]   I was talking eight-way processing in a single chip.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.900]   That's considered like an eight-core processor?
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:00.900]   Actually, it's nine because it has eight, but then it's got a controller, a power PC-style controller.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:05.900]   And that was really one of the first multi-core processors that I saw put on a roadmap at least
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.900]   at the previous E3 last year when Sony was hinting at what was coming up.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.900]   Yeah, and I don't think it's just for gaming.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   I think it's going to be the kind of thing you'll really benefit from any kind of video encoding,
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.900]   anything where you can multi-thread the process.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.900]   It's a huge benefit.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.900]   The interesting thing about this cell is, yeah, it has the inter-process communication on chip,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   but it also has it off chip.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.900]   And that's ostensibly for copy protection.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   That one cell processor can go online and check with another cell processor to see if you own the rights
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.900]   to this movie or this game, but it also could be used for distributed computing in much more efficient ways
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.900]   than we've seen before, I believe.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:45.900]   That's my understanding.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.900]   Oh, that was in the presentation they showed at E3 last year.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.900]   It was a little spooky when they just started showing cell processors in every home,
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:56.900]   along with the eventual, where we had this one great supercomputer down the road.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.900]   The Earth will be a giant computer and it will come up with the answer 42, but will not know the question!
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.900]   Excellent.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   Beware of Vogon.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:05.900]   Thank you.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.900]   Man.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.900]   Some question, but is it actually like an 8-core processor?
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.900]   Or, because it was really nearly on, it was like 8 DSPs, digital signal processors.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.900]   Well.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.900]   That's like a power piece.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.900]   Yeah, okay.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:22.900]   Is there any difference at this point between a signal processor and a regular processor?
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.900]   Here's the theory behind it.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   Processers up to now have been designed around linear processes.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.900]   Where you do this, then you do that, then you do that.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   That's kind of how programs are written.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   But you've seen, we've come to the end of the line.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   They've increased the pipeline so deep.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.900]   The branch prediction becomes so important.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:43.900]   What you get is a Prescott, which is a horribly ineffective chip because the pipelining is so deep.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   And that's what you do with linear processing.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.900]   So they step back and say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.900]   What if we don't do linear processing?
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.900]   What if we do parallel processing?"
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.900]   And that's really what a DSP is.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:46:00.900]   It's about operating on real-world data, single instruction, multiple data, that kind of thing.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   But if you think about it, a lot of what the most CPU intensive stuff we do is that kind of stuff.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.900]   Right.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:13.900]   Well, if you look at the graphics industry too, it's already built around enormously parallel computing.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.900]   So I think you're going to see more and more coming out of that.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.900]   And I'm sure you see Intel and AMD looking at the graphics companies as serious potential threats.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.900]   I think this is very exciting.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.900]   I think it means it's the next generation now.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:31.900]   I don't know from optical, but it's here right now and it's happening and I think it's very exciting.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.900]   We mentioned E3 a couple of times.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.900]   I know there's a lot of people listening who are wondering about E3.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.900]   Mike has an E3 question for the Twits.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   Hey, Twits.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.900]   This is Mike from Florida and I was just wondering what everyone's looking forward to at E3 2005.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.900]   It starts when?
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   Monday, Tuesday?
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.900]   Monday.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.900]   Monday.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.900]   Are you going, Kevin?
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.900]   I mean, you work for a gaming TV channel.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.900]   Are you going to be there?
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.900]   Yes, I'm going to be there, but not doing any segments or anything like that.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.900]   I'll just be walking around and checking out things.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   Anybody else going down?
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.900]   Nope.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.900]   I can take this year off, Vlad.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:16.900]   Roger Chang is going down to cover it for CNET because he works for CNET's gaming page.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   It's not GameSpot.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   GameSpot.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   It is GameSpot.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.900]   It's on a couple of days ago.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.900]   He just came down.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.900]   Yes.
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   He'll be on the Twitscast next week.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.900]   We're so glad to have Roger.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:36.900]   He couldn't do it this week because he's down there, but he'll be reporting back a full report on E3 next week from Kevin and Roger and then the rest of us will sit back and take a break.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:43.900]   I thought about maybe trying to poke my head in there and see if I can get myself the media registration at the gate, but I didn't pre-register.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.900]   You're Yoshi.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.900]   You just say, "Hey, I'm Yoshi, dude.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:46.900]   Let me in."
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:47.900]   Call me up on Monday, Yoshi.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.900]   I'll see if I can get you a pass.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.900]   Cool.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:51.900]   I wish I could go.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   I'm actually going up to Canada, unfortunately, so I'm not going to.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   Anything exciting?
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.900]   Coming down the pipe?
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   Anybody have any expectations?
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   I just want to know if the Raven are in.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.900]   The system is coming out.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.900]   A new version of system.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.900]   Coming out.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.900]   What's that?
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.900]   What's that?
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900]   System?
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   I'm playing dumb here.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.900]   That's got an interview technique I'm very good at.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.900]   Yes, it's coming out one week from Monday.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.900]   You're kidding?
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.900]   You're announcing a day?
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.900]   Yep, that's the day.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.900]   23rd.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.900]   Sorry.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:22.900]   So that's cool.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.900]   We're going to set up a chat room.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:25.900]   We're going to have a live cam.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.900]   We're going to have a little launch party here.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.900]   You'll be able to watch us partying and having a good time and we'll release it Monday afternoon.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.900]   It's how long?
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.900]   It is a little over ten minutes.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.900]   And it's going to be what?
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.900]   What are you going to cover?
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.900]   I don't want to talk about that quite yet.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   Oh.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   It's going to be a device that we built from the ground up.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.900]   It's a custom circuit that we created to do something that's never been done before.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.900]   Holy cow.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.900]   So it's going to be a good first episode and we're really excited to get out the door.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.900]   And then I have another major announcement.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.900]   We'll announce here on Twitch next week.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   That has nothing to do with that but is big news as well.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   Big, big, big, big news because I know what it is.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.900]   But I can't say either because I'm under NDA.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:08.900]   Yes.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   He's got to kick my butt if I'll say it again.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   He's setting stuff.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.900]   Only with Kevin is the only guy I'd ever give an NDA to.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.900]   I do so I'm the loser.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.900]   You'll have to listen to next week's podcast.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:21.900]   Yes.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:27.900]   So system is going to be, how often do you think you're going to come out with another episode?
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.900]   Probably two to three releases per month.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   Okay.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:32.900]   Almost weekly.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.900]   And yeah, close to weekly and we have, I'm going to put a countdown clock up on the site tonight
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.900]   at system.org.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.900]   And then you can also sign up for the newsletter and we'll send you out links to download everything
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.900]   early.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   S-Y-S-T-M, no-E.org.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.900]   Correct.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.900]   S-Y-S-T-M.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:51.900]   O-R-G.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.900]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.900]   That's really great news.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.900]   Congratulations.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.900]   I know you've been working for a while on this.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.900]   Yeah, it takes a while.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.900]   The first episode always takes a while because we have to get all of our music together and
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.700]   kind of streamline everything.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.260]   But now we should be able to crank them out much faster.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.500]   And then you tape it down as they say in the electronics industry and you can pop them
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.900]   out every five minutes.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.900]   That's right.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.420]   Everybody got very popular all of a sudden.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.180]   The phones are ringing off the looks here.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.900]   What's going on?
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.900]   Okay.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.900]   Let's see.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.580]   I'm looking at some different questions.
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.380]   We've got so many questions.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.260]   I want to get as many in as I can.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.260]   Here's one from Nasser.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.260]   Hi, guys.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   Love this show.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.940]   Kevin Yoshi, whoever there has a PSP.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:43.300]   I just want to say, is the PSP worth buying?
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:49.620]   Because it's 250 plus after movies and games, it can go 300 or higher in price.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.220]   So do you guys think it's worth buying?
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.740]   All right.
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.740]   Everybody all together now.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.740]   Three, two, one.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.740]   Yes.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.740]   Yes.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.740]   Who said no?
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   I haven't.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.740]   No.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:01.740]   Patrick.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.740]   I said yes.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.740]   Patrick's a cheap skate.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:04.740]   Why not, Patrick?
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   I don't play that many video games anymore.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.660]   And two, I don't know.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.380]   Just not into it at this point.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.820]   But everybody else, I'm thrilled with it.
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.820]   I love it.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.820]   I love mine.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.980]   I say yes, just because it's so fun to hack with.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.820]   I mean, there's so many different little mods and add-ons for it now.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.620]   You can circle the internet with them.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.500]   That one, you have to buy wipe out pure because it has a browser on it.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:35.140]   And then you have to either use somebody's DNS or you hack your own DNS and then you
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:36.140]   can go.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.340]   The design of the PSP along with its potential, I think those are.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:43.580]   If you like the gaming, the way gaming is on a PS2 platform, it's hard to go.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:47.780]   There's nothing like playing Twisted Metal on your Wi-Fi network.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.980]   You're sitting, you're not connected to anything, and you're playing people around the world
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.620]   head to head.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.860]   I mean, portable network gaming is very cool.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.860]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.860]   A lot of people.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:02.700]   How difficult will it be for third party emulators and things like that on that platform?
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.940]   Well, look how hackable it's been so far.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.180]   Well, already starting to see some.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.660]   Yeah, the MDU was a Nintendo emulator.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   Is there?
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.020]   So the processor in the PSP is fast enough to emulate what a GameCube?
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.020]   The MD.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.020]   I'm sure.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.020]   Standard Nintendo.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.020]   I think this is an old Nintendo emulator.
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.020]   There's a Game Boy.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.020]   Game Boy.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.020]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.580]   You're playing a Game Boy game on your PSP.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.060]   Now that's old school.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:30.740]   A little goofy, actually.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.660]   What's your favorite game right now, Yoshi?
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.980]   Anything you particularly like?
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.700]   I'm really into Twisted Metal, just because I have friends in the Bay Area that I play
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.700]   with.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.700]   It's so fun.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.140]   It's kind of like my little key to them.
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.140]   I love that game.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.660]   I play a lot of the racing games, like the Need for Speed Underground.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.660]   How about Luminous?
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.660]   Anybody playing that?
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.660]   People are raving about that.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:51.660]   It's just Tetris, right?
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.220]   It's Tetris, but it has an interactive musical aspect.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.380]   The better you do, the music changes.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.180]   As you move pieces around, it changes beats and that stuff.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.220]   It can be fun.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.900]   If you've got a few hours to kill, you're sitting there waiting for a car to be finished
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:08.980]   or something to repair a shop, it's a good way to kill a couple hours.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.220]   Sounds like you've actually had a car repair.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:19.060]   Yes, I've sat there waiting for a couple hours or something.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.060]   Any other thoughts?
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:26.020]   Have we wound this show up and we're going to spin it down?
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.900]   Somebody hacked that PSP so we can use the full resolution, darn it.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.900]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   There's more resolution than we're seeing.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.580]   When I'm PSP video 9?
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:38.380]   You simply can't encode to a file to the memory stick that can use the full resolution
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.460]   or the most advanced codec within the device.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.340]   What we were talking about earlier, well, that's proprietary Sony, right?
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.500]   Limited, well, it's close enough to...
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.900]   I need to play around a little bit more.
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:49.900]   I don't know.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.180]   What's your favorite hack right now, Kevin, on the PSP?
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.860]   I just really like all the portal stuff that you can connect to, these different portals
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.380]   and read all your favorite different feeds.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.380]   It's pretty cool.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.380]   It's pretty directly from the PSP.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.540]   It's a lot of fun because it's why I find you just take it with it.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.540]   You don't have to pull out your laptop and there's wherever you are.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.540]   You can connect up.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:10.380]   There's a funny hack on the Mac that turns your address book and your calendar into jpegs,
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.940]   which then loads onto the PSP so you can have your calendar on there, which is kind of
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.940]   nothing.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.940]   Cool.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   We'll do that with ebooks, too.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:18.940]   Perfect.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:19.940]   That's what I'd love to see.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.940]   Yeah, there's an iTunes controller for it that's really cool.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.180]   I'd like to see an e-book reader.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.340]   There's no Bluetooth in it, though, right?
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.340]   It's just Wi-Fi.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.340]   No, it's just 802.11.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.900]   Well, guys, I think this pretty much wraps it up.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.260]   Any last thoughts from anybody?
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.780]   I guess I'll see you in a few days, Leo, right?
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.780]   You're coming up to Canada.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.780]   You're going to do call for help.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.780]   We're going to have a great time.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.060]   Plan our conquest of the world, at least of the world media.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   Good to do.
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.060]   That's right.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.060]   I'll take the audio.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.060]   You take the video, all right?
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.060]   Sounds good.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.860]   Well, we'll just split it right down the middle.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.100]   Patrick, you've got to come up.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.380]   All you've got to come up to Canada sometime, you know?
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.380]   Definitely.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   It's fun, Toronto.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.980]   Especially this time of year, it's beautiful.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:04.420]   We'll look for system, systm.org, and that'll be launching on Monday, a week from tomorrow.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.060]   Yeah, sign up for the newsletter.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.060]   That's exciting.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.300]   And I'll send you out an invite to download a few hours early if you sign up for the newsletter.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:15.420]   Our webpage is thisweekintech.com, and you guys will be posting to your blogs there, right?
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.420]   Hint, hint.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   I also want--
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.940]   I want you to-- everybody goes there, click on those PayPal buttons on the right.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.420]   That's what keeps the show going.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   We have over 2,000 subscribers, but 125,000 listeners.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.020]   So a few more of you, it'd be sure nice if you just-- a couple of bucks a month, that's
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:35.980]   all it costs, less than a gallon of gas, and we use the money wisely, don't we, gentlemen?
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   Yes, we do, literally.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.980]   We don't use it up.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.980]   Parties.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.980]   We know--
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.980]   It's true clubs.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.980]   That kind of thing.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.320]   Who are we hiring for the launch partner?
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   Not Devo.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.620]   That's all I can say.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.140]   Not but Devo.
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.660]   If you want to call with a question, we have several ways to reach us.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.980]   You can of course record as these people who were just on the show did.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:58.900]   I want to thank Aaron and Jonathan and Philip and Tristan and Ashley, Mike and NASA for
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.000]   calling in.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.340]   You can email those questions, just record them with best quality, and bless you.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.340]   Wow.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   Sorry.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.340]   The owl is a little--
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.740]   Yeah, the fidelity on Skype is getting better all the time.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.860]   You can email them to questions at thisweekintech.com.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.980]   We also have a phone number.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.300]   It's a Seattle number, so it's not toll free.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   It's 206-339-TWIT.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.420]   206-339-TWIT.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:28.140]   You can leave a voicemail, and you can also Skype voicemail us this week in tech is our
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.060]   Skype handle this week in tech.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.540]   This is the last time we're going to use Skype, all-- God willing.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.820]   We're going to have much better sound quality, I think, next week.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.460]   So we apologize in advance for the sound quality of this particular show.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:45.700]   We've tried them, and I think all of the voice over IP technologies leave a little bit to
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.540]   be desired once you get more than a few people in.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.340]   As good as Skype has been, and we love you Skype, next week we're going to have a somewhat,
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.140]   I hope, higher quality.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:58.020]   We spent some of that dough, some of that loot people are sending us on something a little
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:02.380]   bit nicer.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.380]   Anything else?
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.380]   Final thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.420]   My motto for the week, the best way to predict the future?
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.540]   Invent it yourself.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.540]   Have a great evening.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:12.940]   Take care.
