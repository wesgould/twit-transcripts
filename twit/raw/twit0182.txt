[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520]   I'm getting nauseous.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   Right now joining us, John C. Devorak Devorak.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   What is it?
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.520]   Do channeldevorak.com?

[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   Is that right?

[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   If you want to see all this stuff, it's probably channel
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   Devorak.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   It's probably the best.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   You'll see it all on channeldevorak.com.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   Every little bit of it.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   Also with us, we're really glad to have her.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   Because for a while I was thinking she just really didn't
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   ask me.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   Molly Wood.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   Hello.

[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.120]   And now that you're not on Buzz L.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.520]   Loud so much, I think we can have you more on Twit.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   I think it's good news for you because I won't be regurgitating
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   all my opinions.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   I'll practically be hearing it for the first time.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   They'll be fresh.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   I know I might be completely uninformed.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   I have to warn you.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   That's fine.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   That's part of the course.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   That's how we work.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520]   That's how we roll here at Twit.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   So I read your blog post which I loved, really loved about being a
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   woman in technology.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   But I didn't really get what you said because towards the end you
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   said I'm going to do less stuff.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   I thought that was funny too.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   I liked it but I didn't understand a damn thing.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   Well, I missed the point which is you weren't going to do as much
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   Buzz L. Loud.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   Well, you know, that had been, it's interesting because this
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   blog post went up on a couple of weeks after I had announced on
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.520]   the show that I was going to do Buzz L. Loud only once a week.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   I'm no longer a full-time host of Buzz L. Loud.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   And so this was kind of like a reaction to the reaction of being
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   not doing Buzz L. Loud.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   Like here's what's been happening people.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   It was just one of the, it was one of the, it's the kind of
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   blog post that I thought John Burek would just have a field
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   day with overly personal, emotional, pathetic.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   And it was by the way in small type.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   Did you say pathetic?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   No.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   It was a great post.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   I loved it.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   So what is the reason for this?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520]   I didn't see the post.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   For some reason it's thoughts on being a woman in technology.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   It is.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520]   Because you're a woman you're giving up.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   You know, this is the problem we have.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   People always, why don't you get more women on your shows?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   Why don't you interview more women?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   Well, it's interesting because it started out as a thoughts on being
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   a woman in technology and ended up as a thoughts on being a human in
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   the world.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   Like people, we, I have had a problem setting boundaries for
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   myself.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   I was at one point doing 17 shows a week for CNET TV.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   Well, I don't know what that's like.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   I mean, Leo knows.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   I don't know how he does it.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   But I was like, you know what the difference is, Molly?
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520]   They're my shows.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   That's the difference right there.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   And I have a toddler.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.520]   I mean, not to be like, you know, I didn't do that when I had little
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   kids.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   You're absolutely right.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   I have teenagers now.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   Exhausting kind of thing.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   So I just am trying to set, you know, so the post was really about in
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.520]   2009 just trying to find my place, figure out what I want to do and set
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   some boundaries for myself.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.520]   And one of those is like, I can't do a daily show.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   That is a part time job and I have a whole other full time job to do.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   You know, if you go back to 2006, I did very much the same thing on tech
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   TV and a lot.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   I quit the screensavers because I was doing call for help every day and
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   then a radio show on the weekends and people thought that was crazy.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   Very similar.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520]   And it had another to do with being a woman in technology.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520]   Right.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   And that's where, you know, at the end of the post it all falls apart because I
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   go like, this isn't really about being the first part of sort of about
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   being a woman or whatever.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   But most of it is just about like, you have to take care of yourself,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.520]   but I do think that there's more pressure on a woman who is a very visible
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   woman in technology because you, there are so few of you.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   You have to, you have this kind of burden on you.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   Just as Obama, I'm sure as a burden being the first African American president,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   you kind of become a standard bearer for your gender, which is hard for
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   anybody.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   It is hard.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   I think that the worst thing, you know, that any woman in technology can hear the
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   worst insult that can be lobbied at us is you don't know what you're talking
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   about.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   And that is the, the almost the instant conclusion that most people make if we
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   make a tiny mistake, if we print down something wrong, God forbid, you know,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   that kind of thing.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   You know what's interesting about that is that women always assume that it's
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   about them being a woman when somebody says that I get people saying that to me
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   constantly.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   Yeah, there are plenty of men who get that.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   I get it too.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   Everybody does.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   You don't know what you're talking about, but we're not hyper sensitized to it.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   I think in cases, the women, because they seem to be sensitive to that particular
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   complaint, they go overboard with trying to know too much about something.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   I definitely do not do that.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   If you, that's why you quit.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   Watch my podcast.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   No, but I think what Molly's saying, I'm not going to put words in your mouth, Molly,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   but it's not really saying you don't know enough.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   It's saying you don't know enough because you're a woman.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   And it is, you know, some, I mean, I've had my fair share of comments accompanied
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   by Bimbo and Blond and girl, you know, there's a, there's a, it gets a little
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520]   -- Yeah, right.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   But the 10th would say I'd do her.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   Yeah, there's an isolate.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   Yeah, I'd love it.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   You're hot even if you're dumb.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   These guys are 12.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   I mean, you have this, you know, she's ugly.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   She's a homie.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   I'd do her.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   You know, and then there's an argument about your looks.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   I mean, I've seen these --
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   Well, it's terrible.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   We don't have to deal with that, John.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   We don't have to deal with that.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   Well, it depends.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   And I have, I mean, I have at this point the skin of a dinosaur.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   I'm not reading those threads and getting upset about them anymore.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   What I'm trying to do really is just find the right compromise between my life and my work.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   Yeah, right on.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   That's it, which is what everybody is trying to do.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   Everybody must do that.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   And that's what I'm saying is I did the same thing.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   We all have to do that.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.520]   And the problem is that with this work, and this is true of broadcasting actually,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   and acting and any other performance, this is not just tech.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.520]   It's that you want to take every opportunity you get because you don't know when the next
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.520]   opportunity is going to come along.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   You do, yeah.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   And you just -- you get so excited about everything and you don't want to say no to anything.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   And then the next thing you know, you're half dead.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.520]   Crying all the time.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   I've learned from John just saying no.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.520]   John's good at saying no.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   I just say no.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   Say no.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   But when you were a columnist, John, you at one point were doing a 20 or so columns a month.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   I think 23 was my peak.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   Yeah, that's unbelievable.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   That's a case of not being able to say no to, isn't it?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.120]   No, no, no, not actually the thing is, is that I had geared myself and it turns out that
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:46.040]   when you're writing at a really high frequency, essentially daily, you just get into the mold
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.520]   of a daily columnist and it doesn't really take you much longer to do.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   It's almost easier.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   It's almost.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.520]   It is easier.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.920]   I could tell you this, and people who do a lot of writing, and if they've done it long enough
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.080]   to tell you the same thing, it's harder to write one column a month than it is to write
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080]   10.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.760]   Because you're right, because you never get in the groove.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.840]   If you're in the groove, it's like you don't have a choice.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.200]   You got to finish this like, you know, co-coder's program and program and tweak and tweak and
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.680]   program and tweak and tweak because they don't have a deadline.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.040]   If you're like at a debt, 23 deadlines a month, you crank out this stuff, you finish
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.240]   it, you get it done, you're done with it, you move to the next one, it's like production
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.840]   work and it's actually easier.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.640]   I don't like gearing up to do that, but once you're geared up to do it, it's not that
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   hard.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.620]   It's a little different with broadcasting and I think generally speaking, I was always
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.120]   comment about this and I think both of you would agree at some point.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.400]   Which is why you have to admire the three hour a day daily guys.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.120]   What you did for a while, Leo, is extremely fatiguing, I think much more so than writing
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   to do two hours or hour or an hour of like TV, for example.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.760]   You are really burnt out because the level of concentration is different than with writing.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   With writing, you can take a break and do this.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.160]   But with TV, you are geared up, you're in full concentration mode.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.360]   You can't take a mental break for the period of time that you're working and then you are
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.320]   extremely worn out.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.920]   It's hard to explain to people who haven't done it.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.720]   Because you're on.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.920]   There's also this thing in baseball players know this, that if you do another show every
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.320]   day, if you screw up one show, you always have tomorrow.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.520]   But if you only play in a football game a week, one little error is magnified.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.880]   It's kind of nice to have another.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.360]   I'm doing about 30 hours a week and it's not tough because I'm just sitting here all the
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   time.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.600]   I'm like, "Well, yeah, you got now to us down to fine art."
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.880]   By the way, Stikham, according to Eric, "My son, Stikham is hosed and doesn't work.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.880]   It also folks have hacked together things so it's piped through you at your screen."
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.240]   Here it is for people at that one.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   There's no video though.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.360]   I don't care what they're doing.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.520]   I'm not broadcasting video.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.040]   I can't get the video out.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   Why do you have to push it?
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   So they're doing the audio.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   So here's the deal.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   I just...
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.040]   But my making this announcement is ludicrous because nobody's going to hear it.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   No one knows.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.040]   I know.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   But if you use stream.tv to that channel that's what it is.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   Or if they're hearing it, they don't need it.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   Exactly.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   So here's the deal.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   Here's the deal.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.320]   We normally stream video over at Stikham.com.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   I don't know.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.600]   Something's wrong with their credential server.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.560]   Not their regular server because video is still going out from other people.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.680]   But I use a special server, that credential server is down.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.280]   So normally we stream the video production of this at live.twit.tv.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.960]   It's not going out today.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.440]   But I have my own audio server which is up, Twit.am.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   And that's what they're doing.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   They're taking the Twit.am audio only feed and re-streaming it on various...
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.160]   It's being re-streamed on Stikham as well as Eustream.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.760]   It's being re-streamed everywhere.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   That's great.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   That's the community.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   I love that.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   I know.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   They're desperate for the stream.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.760]   They're desperate.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   They're desperate.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.680]   So here's a couple of interesting stories.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.200]   I think some really interesting stories.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.080]   Here's in the Schadenfreude category.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   What was it?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   I forgot what it was.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.240]   It was a great Schadenfreude story that I loved.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.400]   Oh, cable operator, charter communications to file chapter 11.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.160]   Is that unbelievable?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:24.240]   So John and I worked for Tech TV which was a Paul Allen joint.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.600]   And Paul lost a lot of money and got fed up, sold it to Comcast which promptly destroyed
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.680]   the thing.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.960]   He had overpaid.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.840]   He also owned charter communications which was a big cable company.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.280]   He'd overpaid considerably for...
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.920]   I remember when he did it for cable subscribers all over the place.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   Now they're struggling.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   They're going to do chapter 11 on April 1st.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.120]   And Paul Allen, now this is...
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.000]   He did the same thing at Tech TV.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.960]   He's going to basically be made whole.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.640]   But all the common stock holders, the investors, are wiped out.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   How can you...
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   Is that illegal?
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.920]   It depends the way it's structured.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   It's totally the same thing.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   He did the same thing on Tech TV.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   You know, we all had shares in Tech TV.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   And that was the first thing they told us.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.520]   Well, Paul is going to get his money out then and then you've got nothing.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.400]   Yes, it's a different class of stock, I'm sure.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   That's why I think that's so rich.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   That's why I do prefer to...
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.240]   He loses a lot of money.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   I think...
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.640]   He says he's lost $7 billion on charter.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.440]   Paul's got a lot of money but it's Microsoft money.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.800]   I don't know how much he's actually made on his own.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.360]   But the fact that you can't make a cable company...
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.840]   How do you lose money with a cable TV?
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   It's a monopoly.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.680]   You know, it's like you have to really do some crazy things.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.920]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   Well, he didn't.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.840]   He paid way too much to acquire subscribers.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.520]   Maybe he spent too much time on his three mega yachts.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.200]   He's got the one.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.720]   Did you ever go on one of his yachts?
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   I don't know.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   I don't get invited to anything.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   No, I never did either.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.920]   But our management did but we didn't get to go.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.120]   He's got one yacht with a submarine.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.840]   Yeah, that's the big one.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   What?
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.600]   And I think it's got two helicopters in a submarine.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   He doesn't...
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.320]   This is the story that was told to me and I don't know if it's true or not.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.760]   Paul Allen, if you ever want to come on the show, you're more than welcome to disabuse
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   us of this.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.080]   But I was told that Paul who likes to scuba dive doesn't like the jarring shock of jumping
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.200]   in the water.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.240]   He prefers to emerge into the water from a submarine.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.440]   Well, that's because his yacht is about 13 stories high.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   He's going to...
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.200]   He also has a recording studio in the basement.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.240]   You know he kind of fancies himself a rock and roll star.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.800]   He has a recording studio in the basement staffed full time 24/7.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.200]   So should he get the urge to lay down a track?
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.120]   He could just go down and lay it down.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.800]   So what will happen to the charter?
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.600]   I mean, because John's right in a lot of places, it's a total monopoly and there's only the
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.040]   one provider but they'll continue to have service, right?
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.040]   It's chapter 11.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   They're not pulling the plug.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   It's not...
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   Right.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   And who else is going through real trouble is XM Sirius.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.040]   Whereas it's Sirius XM.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.320]   Yeah, Kel surprise.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.800]   They have huge debt that they owe this month and of course Charlie Ergan at Dish.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   Charlie's a character.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.840]   He owns Echo Star which is the guy.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.000]   People do the Dish TV.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.480]   He owns quite a few of those bonds.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.560]   So he's saying, "Ah, take it.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   I'll take over the debt.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.640]   Well, we'll acquire you."
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.440]   But Mel Carmisen who runs Sirius XMXM series says, "But yeah, but I lose control."
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.440]   So he's trying to...
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.040]   Now he's gone over to DirecTV saying, "Would you guys like to buy me?"
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040]   Hi.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   Oh, wood.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   I mean, I just can't...
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.040]   Terrible business.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.640]   Right today, there is no reason for anyone to pay $10 a month for radio.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.000]   I mean, that is the first thing to go if you're going to a budget.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   That was always the Achilles heel.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   If you don't look at it.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.520]   I hate it when a company has to make money.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.520]   That's just...
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.040]   You know, that really makes it hard to work.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.960]   Because the problem is radio has been inculcated as a free service for decades and decades
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   and decades.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.200]   And the fact that they came out, it's not $10 a month if you look at it objectively.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.360]   It's $120 a year plus the cost of the equipment.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.520]   It's an extremely expensive proposition.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:14.160]   In these economic times, nobody can afford $120 a month when they can just put a CD in
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.920]   their player and listen to the music that way.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.480]   I mean, everyone's got a huge collection of CDs by now.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.320]   You know, you can go iTunes.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   It's cheaper.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.840]   Or you can plug your iPhone or your iPod or your Zoom or whatever into your car stereo.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   There's just...
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.600]   Or you can stream internet radio in the car over your 3G.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   Right.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.080]   Or even better, you bring down some podcasts like this one and listen to this.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.120]   You can listen to this in your car live.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.600]   Right now, there's an application on the iTunes store called twit.am.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.200]   You press a button and you're listening.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.560]   And frankly, you know, there's...
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   In my car?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   On edge.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   I haven't got an...
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   I haven't got an...
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   Oh.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   Do you do that?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   Do you do that, Molly?
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   If you have an iPhone or a phone that has...
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.560]   Do you do...
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.560]   Do you not...
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   You're not an iPhone user, I am Molly.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.560]   I am an iPhone user, yeah.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.560]   I do streaming radio.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   I use the Slacker Radio app.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   Slacker's great.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   Pandora's great.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   AOL radio.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   And I just don't...
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.840]   Yeah, it's not even about like...
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.680]   It's breaking my heart that, you know, this company has to make money and they can't.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.920]   They're trying to make money off of something that we can get elsewhere and maybe it's not
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.720]   as good but it feels just as good because it's not $10 a month.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's just not a good business proposition if there are so many alternatives that don't
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.480]   cost me that much money.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.200]   You know, it's hurt in broadcast radio too, frankly.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.120]   Yeah, I did an interview about it actually with the CBS radio and you could practically
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   hear the glee in their voices as they talked about the possibility.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   Really?
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   Is going under.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   No.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.520]   I'm sure that broadcast radio wouldn't shed very many tears if Sirius XM is...
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.000]   No, but they're wrong in thinking that's the threat.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   They're threatened in the same way as XM is by Internet Radio.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.640]   I mean, I think that there's no reason to assume that broadcast radio has a monopoly
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   either.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.080]   Aren't they hurting just from people listening to music on their iPods already?
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.240]   Oh, I'm sure, yeah.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   I think so.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.880]   I wouldn't be too gleeful.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.600]   This is going to be the Schadenfreude edition.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   I wouldn't be too gleeful.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.000]   You said that word twice now.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I know.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I like saying that word.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.080]   I don't know what it means, but I like saying it.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   So this is not Schadenfreude, but it's bad news.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.920]   Pioneer is getting out of the TV business.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.160]   Yeah, we talked about this weeks and weeks and weeks ago.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160]   Well, you know...
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   It's been a first for a long time.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160]   This is what's interesting.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.360]   This is when Ryan was on it.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.680]   We thought Ryan was wrong.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.840]   We thought Ryan was confused because Ryan said no, no, no, they're getting out of the
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.760]   business and we said, no, no, they're letting Panasonic make the panels, but they're still
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.760]   selling them.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.920]   He said, no, no, they're getting out of the business.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.560]   He knew he must have known something.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   Clever boy.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.600]   Well, I don't know if he did because he wasn't familiar with the fact that Panasonic was making
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.080]   the Pioneer panels.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.120]   Well, if he didn't know, he failed up because he was absolutely right.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   They failed up.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   I like that failed up.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.120]   I like them using it now.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.120]   I like them using it now.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   I like them using it now.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   I know that's a good thing.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   I'm taking it.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   It's my book.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   It's a book title.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   I'm taking it.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   It's mine.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   Mine.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   Dibs.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   It's a race to the publisher.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   You got cut on, failed up.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   You can both have it.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   You don't care what you're going to do.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   I hate writing.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.600]   I hate writing so much that it would kill me to write another.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.240]   By the way, I got enough from one of the listeners.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.440]   He says, "Broadcast radio is also bankrupt if we're going to be honest about it."
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440]   Absolutely.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.080]   As somebody working in broadcast radio, I'm not too thrilled about that.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.680]   But why do you think CBS bought CNET?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.840]   Molly, I mean, that's their idea.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.720]   To get out of broadcast radio.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:38.160]   Well, at least broaden their depth because broaden their depth makes no sense.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.760]   But to give themselves some alternatives.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   Absolutely.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.560]   Yeah, an escape hatch.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   I mean, the Internet is an escape hatch for traditional broadcast.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.760]   Do you think CBS, I would bet, CBS is most interested in the streaming stuff that you
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.320]   guys are doing?
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.320]   I think so.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.960]   I think there's a lot of opportunity there.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.880]   But honestly, I think that CBS and advertisers and the media world at large should be a lot
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.440]   more interested than they are in podcasting and download delivery.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.520]   We are moving toward.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.600]   We're an on-demand culture more and more and more every day.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.280]   I think we're going to have to get over this idea that you can't track it right and podcasts
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.320]   aren't that sellable and audio is boring and whatever.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.920]   People want to be reached everywhere, including at the gym and in their car.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.640]   That's what on-demand and audio gives them.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.480]   There's an interesting thing happening.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.840]   Obviously, I agree with you.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.560]   I wouldn't have started a business three years to come on based on on-demand audio.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.800]   But there's an interesting thing happening.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.760]   I'm trying to stay one step ahead of this.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.640]   Clearly, by far, by 90 percent, our audience listens download.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.320]   But I've become very interested.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.080]   One of the reasons we're doing all this live streaming is in the notion that, yes, while
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.640]   you do want that capability, there's also something cool about being able to tune into
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.560]   something live.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.320]   You want point is you want choice.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   You want both, right.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   We're doing both.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   You're doing both.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   I think that is definitely the key.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.560]   That's how you build that community too of the people who come and watch you every day.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   Exactly.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.440]   If you're not live, you're not interactive.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.400]   If you want to be a community to me in the long run, it's not download live.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.240]   It's really about community.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.960]   How big your community is, how active your community is.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.720]   I hate to disagree.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.520]   Unfortunately, I have to backtrack on my disagreement because we've been doing that with cranky
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.560]   geese to a point, but we don't have true interaction.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.440]   But Adam decided to start streaming no agenda live.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.160]   It makes a big difference when you do the show because you say something and there's
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.880]   not a big audience compared to the real audience, but it's like 95% like you.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.160]   But the audience says listening, they got stuff to say and they throw it at you and
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.280]   you go, "Oh, I can use this material."
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   I agree.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.160]   It's like it's like crowdsourcing.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.160]   It is.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.400]   It enriches the show as the show is happening.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.160]   It's really a phenomenal experience.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.560]   Even though that's a pure numbers, it's a fraction.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.120]   Who was it said that all you really was it?
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.320]   Kevin Kelly, all you really need is a thousand people, dedicated, committed people to make
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.440]   it, whether it's a rock band or a radio show or TV show, that thousand people, those core
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.360]   P1 most involved listeners are the ones that will propel you to success.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.680]   I don't know if that number is right.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.520]   It seems like it's low.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.440]   Right now we have, even though we're not streaming video, usually we have two or three
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.280]   thousand people watching the video, but there's 700 people in the chat room.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.880]   Those are clearly, I mean, anybody who goes in a chat room is clearly heavily invested
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.880]   in the community.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.880]   Or a net ball.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.480]   Or a Weisenheimer, which is a word I should reinvigorate.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.200]   I love the Weisenheimers.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.400]   They're great.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.040]   I don't care.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.160]   They're involved, even if they're making Weiskrex, they're involved.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.240]   Let me make a note of that.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Weisenheimer.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   Weisenheimer.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.560]   I got you a new book, Weisenheimers Fail Up.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.400]   I have dibs on fail up.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   Too late.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.880]   Don't make me arm wrestle you for this.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.840]   The thing is titles are not copyrightable.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   Do you know that?
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.360]   I do know that actually from my days at O'Reilly.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   You were going to call this.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.760]   There was a lot of anger about that.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.560]   But you can still threaten and save a rattle.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   We were going to call the show.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.600]   Remember when the Twitter started, we were called the Revenge of the Screen Savers.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.920]   And I got a very nice letter from G4 saying, "Well, you really can't name it that."
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920]   But I could have, right?
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.200]   Could have done whatever you wanted.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.000]   You could have told them to tell them to tell them to insult.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.080]   What difference does it make to them anyway?
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.840]   It's not like they're doing the show.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.240]   Revenge of the attack of the show.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   That's just confusing.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.680]   You could just change the name to the people that G4 are big A-holes.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   I don't think there's a call-out.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   No, I think they get violation there.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   Ball Allen sucks.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.480]   Ball Allen sucks.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.680]   There's another one.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.400]   Ball Allen, weirdly not good at business.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   What a surprise.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   Where would he be?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.920]   He's a coder.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.680]   So 10,000 jobs at Pioneer Gone, they're going to get out of TV into the very lucrative
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.880]   car, stereo, and GPS business.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.080]   That's where they're putting all their hopes.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.880]   Nobody's even buying cars anymore.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   Crazy.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.360]   But they are upgrading their...
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.800]   I mean, at least they're doing aftermarket.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.840]   Are they going to actually try to be OEM?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   For what?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   With that stuff?
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   Or do for the car electronics?
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   They've always made radios for cars so they should be a problem.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.520]   And they're going to do aftermarket car electronics and try to...
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   It's crazy.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   Why bother?
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   Stupid.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.400]   Visio is also killing the plasmas.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's kind of sad because I think plasmas really are giving you the best home theater look.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Right now.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.360]   The LCDs are just killing them because you know why?
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.080]   Because you go in the store and they're brighter and they look better in the store.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.360]   You know, I was just in Costco yesterday as a matter of fact.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:43.200]   And when you go to Costco, you know, anyone who's a Costco fan, by the way, if you do
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.600]   a lot of shopping at Costco, you are completely clinically insane not to spend the $100 for
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.680]   the executive membership.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.000]   Oh, please do that.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I totally agree.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.320]   Well, they sure push it hard.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   Like every time I go to Costco, they say, you know, you'd save a lot of money if you
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.680]   had the executive membership.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   Why wouldn't I want that?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.080]   Because I get a check every year.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:09.960]   I get a check every year for between $125 and $250 rebate, which pays for the executive
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   membership.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.040]   So in other words, my membership is free.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.480]   That's a lot of toilet paper.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   You really get...
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   I don't know though.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.360]   I'm like a pretty casual Costco shopper and it still pays off for us.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.440]   We go maybe one some month now.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.920]   You know, I don't go more than once a month, but you know, I'll buy wine and I'll buy
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.600]   a bunch of these items.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.160]   I can't get out of Costco without dropping $250.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160]   I know.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.800]   I wish I could only drop $250 at Costco.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.120]   That's a lot of pampers.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.560]   So the point is is that if you join the executive membership...
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.560]   Oh, yeah, the wife.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.160]   You know, you still buy even when they're teenagers, you still buy the wipes, by the
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   way.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.160]   Those things are amazing.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   They're great.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   They will get...
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   They will get...
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   Everywhere.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   They will get anything off anything.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.600]   There's some solvent they put in there, I'm sure.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.120]   I don't know what's in there, but I can't believe it's safe for babies.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.400]   It's amazing how off the course we go on the show.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.800]   And they say women don't belong in technology.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.000]   Someone said to me on Twitter, "Are you guys going to actually talk about news today?"
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.040]   And I wrote back like, "Not bloody likely."
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:12.000]   You know, I think there's a misapprehension that this show is somehow supposed to be...
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.600]   Buzz Out Loud does a very good job running down the daily...
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.400]   Running down the all the high tech stories.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.240]   I'm as a taskmaster.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.880]   This is more like some friends sitting around gassing.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   I don't know.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.920]   I think we should still have more tech.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.080]   But let me get back to the...
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.640]   Let me take the detour off the road, back under the freeway and the on-ramp going the
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.120]   other way and get back to my Costco story.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.800]   I walk in...
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.160]   Anyone who walks in the Costco, the first thing you notice is there's a first display
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.200]   of the plasma displays.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   Okay.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   And then next to that are the LCDs as you walk further.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.800]   So they start with the plasmas.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   Yes.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.840]   I don't know of a store that doesn't do it that way.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.600]   Although I've only got three or four of them.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.100]   I get to go to one in Port Angeles, I go to San Francisco, I go to the one up in near
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.600]   the neck of the woods in Novato and I go to Richmond.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.000]   And they start off with this plasma.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.480]   The weird thing, by the way, is in the side, there's a store in Washington, state and
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   portentia.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.000]   It's exactly backwards.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.320]   You go into the left-hand side and you go around exactly the opposite way.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.520]   It's very unnerving.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.080]   Anyway.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.600]   So I was looking at the plasmas and I have to say now you can get a really good 52-inch
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.880]   plasma for about $999.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.720]   This would have been the same device, it would have been $30,000 a few years ago.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   It's a lot better than it used to because the old plasmas used to posterize.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.600]   It's just a beautiful image, beautiful.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.240]   And the LCDs to me, I still see them falling apart.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.440]   They fragment when there's heavy action.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.280]   They are trying not to show too many action movies on the LCDs.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.080]   Do you think that plasma really lost the PR war in some ways?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.000]   Because I feel like I still hear people saying, well, plasma is going to get burn-in and
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.960]   plasma is a huge energy hog.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.000]   Maybe there's like a negative vibe about plasma.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.920]   There's a dark cloud hanging over them.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.200]   Well, I talked about slicker and nicer and brighter.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.120]   The last bastion of plasma is Panasonic in terms of who...
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.400]   Although I read a stat and I finally started to believe that Samsung and LG sell 90% of
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.160]   all plasmas.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   That can't be right.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.160]   It must have been an error.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.920]   I find that hard to believe too.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.120]   But anyway, I've talked to Panasonic people about this over and over again.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.360]   And they say the burn-in thing is long.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.840]   That's not true anymore.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.280]   The things last at least a decade of constant use.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.200]   It's just a completely...
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   There is a little more energy use, but it's not as though the LCDs are necessarily cheap.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.280]   They still have the fluorescent bulb in there.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:47.000]   I would say once the LCDs go 100% to LED backlighting, then I think the days are numbered for plasma.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.480]   But if I was going to go buy one today, I would buy one of these plasmas.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.160]   I tried to get Robert Herron on the show to talk about this and also the demise of DLTV,
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   which we'll talk about a little later.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:04.080]   But my other home theater expert, Scott Wilkinson, says that these new LED backlit LCDs, they
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   have some that the blacks are every bit as black, in fact, even blacker than plasma.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.640]   And that really is where plasma has advantages in the contrast ratios.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:17.240]   They are getting LCD every bit as good, in fact, a little bit better than plasmas.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.080]   Yeah, I mean, I would buy an LCD now.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.680]   I totally admit that I think I've fallen prey to the dark cloud of her plasma.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.440]   No, go to Costco and look at these plasmas.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.600]   These plasmas are gorgeous.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   They have...
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   Oh, I love my pioneer.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   You can look at an action movie on them.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Oh, I love my pioneer.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.120]   I mean, that's what I have a plasma now.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.720]   It's just like if I was going to get a second one, I think, oh, I don't know.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   I guess I'm going to have a...
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.680]   You guys, I'm using a projector.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   What?
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.160]   Oh, well, that's kind of awesome, actually.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.080]   No, if he's got a good one, that's better than anything.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   Yeah, it's a better one.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080]   That's way better.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.680]   But you have to have blackout curtains on the windows to watch.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   Visio...
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.920]   No, if the sun's not pounding into the room, you can watch.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.440]   Visio's also getting out of the plasma market.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.680]   Well, that's weird.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.440]   Oh, well, yeah, they're going straight LCDs.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.080]   LCD, yeah, they're not getting out of TVs.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   They're getting out of plasma.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.000]   I guess the LCD business, you know, apparently they got into the eighth generation, or maybe
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.560]   I don't know, maybe further.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.080]   And I went to one of the display shows and they show the different size of the panels
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.520]   that they manufacture at these factories.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.000]   The ones they make now are the size of like...
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   They're huge.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.160]   They're like eight feet tall by, you know, six feet wide.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   They're monsters.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.520]   We had 108 inch LCD on Regis and Kelly.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.520]   Kelly looked like a little tiny little elf.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520]   That's doing it.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.800]   She was so small.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.200]   Actually, Regis isn't much bigger.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   They're both.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   Yeah, they're little people.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   They're diminutive.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   Would be the point.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   diminutive.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   That's a nice way to put that.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   I mean, I guess that's what the technology is doing.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.800]   So LCD it is.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   There we go.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   Bring it on.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.840]   Two satellites collide in orbit.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   I don't think...
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   Has this happened before?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.520]   A commercial iridium communication satellite and a defunct Russian cosmos satellite ran into
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   each other Tuesday?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.000]   What are the odds of that above Siberia?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.440]   Somebody thinks something's phony, baloney about this.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.960]   Oh, you talking to Adam Curry?
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.880]   Does he think it's the grand conspiracy?
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.760]   Well, he thinks everything is, but that's kind of beside the point.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.440]   No, there's a sketchy.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.040]   I mean, who says that there were...
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.440]   I heard the space debris.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   You can go...
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.600]   I was listening to spaceweatherradio.com and they said...
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   We did it on the show.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.400]   It was Thursday at I think it was 345 Pacific.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.080]   We were listening and they said, "Listen, you'll hear a tone if the radar detects
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.960]   space debris."
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.400]   It was just like that.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.720]   It sounds like you could do a dolphin imitation.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.000]   That was impressive.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.320]   So I heard the space debris, of course, they told me it was space debris.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.760]   But apparently over Houston right now, debris is falling as we speak.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.320]   Oh, Hor-
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   [BEEP]
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.560]   Debris is falling.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.200]   That's the name of my new book.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   Debris.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   Right that time.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.400]   That is a good title.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   Debris is falling.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   I...
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   What?
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.960]   I don't understand what we get out of the satellites collided conspiracy other than
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.320]   the idea of maybe not putting someone to junk up there in the first place.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.720]   There was a space war and...
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.200]   Oh, we need to...
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.920]   One of our tie fighters was blown up.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   Explained it away.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.560]   And so it was satellite.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.800]   Yeah, that's a...
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.960]   Alien debris.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's aliens.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   Aliens.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.360]   It could be a flying saucer that blew it out.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   Why?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.400]   I did see a meteor in broad daylight the other day.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   Oh, really?
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   That's cool.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   Like really bright, streaking across the sky.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.880]   I mean during the day, yeah, it was...
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   Did I not thought like that?
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.880]   It's a good meteor.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.880]   You can see it during...
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   I've seen one during the day.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.720]   But I'm just saying it was pretty close to the satellite collision event.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.240]   So could have been part of the Alien War.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   Break it.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   If you...
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   If you already do a show with Adam Currie...
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.600]   I'm gonna say, if you plant this with Adam and like say that's what it was, it could
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   take on.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   I think Adam is listening.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.560]   I think there's just a bunch of crap up there and it's not surprising that it eventually
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   runs into it.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   We're gonna have more of these, yeah.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.840]   Adam is on line on stage.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.480]   This brings up a woman's driver joke I remember seeing from you.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   No, no, no.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.960]   Years and years ago where there's this woman...
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.440]   Are you just baiting me now?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.000]   Middle of the desert and one tree and she plows into it.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.800]   I mean it's not as unlikely as these things are...
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   That's the joke?
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   That was a hilarious joke.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   Whoo!
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   I'm just saying it reminded me of that.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   I didn't say it.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   Me and her!
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.000]   Oh, guys, you're funny.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.960]   Okay, so let's go to Windows 7.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   Windows 7.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.320]   Now this is a completely, I think, a silly rumor.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.880]   But it's a rumor and I guess we should report it.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.840]   It's certainly a PC magazine felt it was worth repeating.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:58.760]   This is Chloe Albenasius writing in PCMag.com that Windows 7 will come out at the end of
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:04.560]   the year and there will be a free upgrade for Vista buyers.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.560]   This is what they do.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   Oh yeah.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.560]   This is what Microsoft does.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   They did the same thing for Vista.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.480]   This exact same thing was announced months ago.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.200]   Oh, it's not all Vista users.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   Just ones that buy it.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.000]   It's ones that buy within the first state.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.320]   Yeah, they did the same thing for Vista if you bought it from October until the time
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   that Vista...
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.160]   I was amazed that this was so breathlessly reported.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   I got excited.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   Well, I misunderstood.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.640]   I thought it was for everybody because I really would love to have that free upgrade.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.960]   That wouldn't make sense.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.680]   I'm campaigning for it to be a $49.95 upgrade.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.120]   It really should be a cheap upgrade.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   People who bought Vista are unhappy.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.120]   They deserve it.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   They deserve it.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.120]   They deserve it.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   We deserve it to be a cheap upgrade.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   Yes.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   It should be a cheap...
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.440]   Okay, I know they're not going to go for $49.85, but $99 they could go for.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   That wouldn't be too bad.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.480]   I think that's a reasonable goal for us to...
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.040]   I think it should be free.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040]   Okay.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.680]   They're from free to $100.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.120]   Preferably closer to free.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   So, okay.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.880]   So let's talk about the Microsoft retail stores.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   Oh, man.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   You do?
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   Love it.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.520]   Now, see, they're looking at Apple going, "Man, these guys, I mean, Apple's really..."
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.360]   I poo-pooted when Apple said, "Let's do retail stores."
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.800]   I said, "Look, what happened to Gateway?
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.080]   You don't want to be in the retail business."
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   And I was so wrong.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   They say, "Beated."
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.760]   Gateway Compuad, there's a whole bunch.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.560]   Well, I wrote a call in MarketWatch, which you didn't put on the list or you ran this
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.000]   joke column from PC Pro.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I'm sorry, I was mistaken.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I'll do that.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   It's okay now.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I don't care how...
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Go over to the MarketWatch columns and all that.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.920]   But I wanted to mention something that seems to be overlooked in this, "Oh, Microsoft's
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   copying Apple.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.440]   Microsoft's copying Apple."
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:42.520]   Microsoft had a retail store two years before Apple had its retail store.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.280]   And it was at the Metreon and San Francisco.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   Oh, it was awful.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.720]   And the second floor of the Metreon and San Francisco, why was it awful, Leo?
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   Because it was...
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.280]   Well, as Robert Scobel pointed out, it was on the second floor.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   There was no foot traffic.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.200]   You'd go in there and everything was in boxes.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.240]   And it was a flop, wasn't it?
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.120]   I was there, I think, three times I was the only person there ever.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.120]   It was now.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.120]   Because they didn't know how to merchandise.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.080]   I bought this for a concept.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.000]   Microsoft never told anybody this store existed.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.960]   Well, I'm right.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   Now they are.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   See?
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   They're already doing it better.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   All right.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.840]   What would you do in a Microsoft retail outlet?
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.200]   How would you make...
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.240]   Because the truth is, really, most people's relationship with Microsoft isn't through
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.120]   Microsoft, it's through an OEM, it's through Dell or Gateway or Sony.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.880]   They don't have a relationship with Microsoft.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.160]   So how do you make a nice Microsoft store?
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.720]   You show people's computers, other companies' computers?
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   I think it's got to be a store oriented toward the Xbox 360 in games.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.720]   And the Zoom.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.920]   I mean, I think you can make it more of a multimedia store.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.240]   It's not a computer store.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.560]   It's not like Best Buy, or it's not the idea that you walk in and you're buying a laptop.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.080]   Although they should have that.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   They should definitely hear it.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.960]   No, they even should because they did having somebody else's production.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.760]   Unless Microsoft, by the way, and I have been predicting this forever, but it hasn't happened
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.760]   yet.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   Hardware.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.720]   Hardware that Microsoft would bring out a branded computer someday.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.400]   And if they were going to do that, they'd have to do this store because they'd never sell
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.800]   any if they didn't.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.520]   That's ultimately why Apple did a retail store is they couldn't get Apple computers
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.080]   in regular retail.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.800]   They said we've got to do it ourselves.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   They had a...
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.000]   They have a deal with cop USA.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.560]   They have yanking them out of Apple retail because they couldn't control it.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   Right.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   The control was the issue.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.680]   In fact, I've been writing about this since the first computer store opened when the
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.840]   byte store is in computer land, which is the fact that I could not understand why these
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.280]   hardware companies weren't opening.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.920]   Not necessarily megastores or big stores like the Gateway store, which I thought was poorly
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.000]   advised.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.040]   But small little outlet stores, the way the car companies used to do in the '50s, that
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.600]   just had their models there for sale and a salesman who knew how to sell that had one
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.880]   sales pitch.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.680]   I want you to buy this computer.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.760]   When you went to CompUSA, it's a crap shoot on who's getting bribed as to what they're
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.760]   going to push.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   I think the reason...
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.600]   I think the Apple stores have done a phenomenal...
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   A phenomenal...
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   Wow.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   A phenomenal...
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   This is what happens when I only do this once a week.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.560]   Now we see why you quit the radio show.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.000]   A phenomenal amount of good for the brand.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.040]   I think that those stores have really contributed to their rise in market share because you
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.840]   can go in, have a nice interaction, and walk out with something.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.520]   There's an instant gratification that occurs and it's a pretty good retail experience.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.520]   If Microsoft can replicate that, then I think that it will be huge for them.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.520]   Well, we know they won't do that.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.320]   They'll probably blow it.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   It's true.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.960]   They're not the best at marketing ever.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   I mean...
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.120]   No, they're monopolist.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.600]   I mean, monopolists don't know how...
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.920]   They never get good at marketing.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.800]   There's no pressure on them to do so.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.960]   Is there any PC manufacturer who does a good job of this?
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.960]   I have sales of...
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   Directs...
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   Yeah, Directs Gateway store wasn't so hot.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.120]   Dell does some...
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.960]   Like they're in malls and places and stuff.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.760]   But does anybody who does a good job, Sony?
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   There's not.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.400]   And that's why I think the Apple stores have been so good.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.040]   Maybe Sony, they have those weird Sony style stores.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:18.160]   But with Apple, it's an easy experience for someone to walk in and buy an iMac and leave.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.280]   And if you can make it that easy to buy a computer, that's just a winner.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.160]   They've really paid attention to a lot of details to the way you're approached in the
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   store.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.680]   You don't wait in line at a cash register.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.240]   They will sell you the computer you're standing right there to carry those little windows
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.240]   mobile devices.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.720]   They've done it right.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.880]   It's not a perfect read.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.360]   Everybody is going to have a story about how they went in there and it sucked.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.520]   But for the most part, you can have a pretty good experience and they know what they're
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.520]   talking about.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.760]   That makes a big difference.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:53.840]   And then they actually, to a certain degree, demystify the purchase process.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.320]   You don't have to make that many choices.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   You know, I think it's kind of a lie, not just Apple, but every PC maker tells that
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.480]   these things are easy to use and that you're going to be able to get home and do something
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   with it.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.040]   I often feel like they're really, in fact, all of us are a little bit party to this misleading
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:15.400]   normal people because the truth is it's really not that easy.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   It's really a mess.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   You get home.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   It's going to be a nightmare.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   You're going to be pulling your hair out.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.080]   Nobody tells the real truth about this stuff.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.480]   Don't we all kind of, aren't we a little bit culpable there?
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.160]   Well, you know, the thing is that from the beginning of the personal computer desktop
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:39.800]   micro computer revolution in the mid 70s, it was always required that you had a friend.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   Right.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.920]   Somebody that would help you get up to speak, because it's not that hard.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.240]   If you take somebody, sit them in front of a Macintosh or even a PC for that matter and
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.280]   you spend 15 minutes with them showing them how to do this, that and the other thing, they'll
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.480]   at least be on their way and then they can maybe call you again shortly after.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   But it's a very community oriented thing.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.120]   It's like, you know, you're just like learning how to drive.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.400]   I mean, you just don't go buy a car and then drive.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.080]   You have to be taught how to drive and you have to take tests and you have your dad shows
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.760]   you how to drive or whatever.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.920]   I mean, we assume that we, you know, we could just drive a computer without anything.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.600]   We just sit down and work.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.280]   But I think we're told that it takes a feel.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.520]   Well, you know, in the early days of automobiles, when you, when you bought an automobile,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.480]   you got to show, you got a driver mechanic with it.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.160]   Like you wouldn't, you'd expect to do it yourself.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.120]   Well, and yeah, Tom Merritt makes this point a lot that, that the computer is still fundamentally,
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.320]   even now, after all these years, kind of a tinkerer's machine, tinkerer's experience.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   It's worse than ever.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   It's better.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.640]   It's getting more confusing and then more fractured.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:51.160]   You know, you've got more alternatives, whether it's the Dell or HP putting a little mini
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.560]   OS over top of Windows for instant boot and then, you know, the Windows versus Mac thing
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.640]   and then the boot camp thing and then it's just the best out there.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.320]   You have to be an enthusiast to have a chance at this and then the security issues alone.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:10.440]   You know, I got a call from a friend saying, my Aunt Petunia, can you stop at her house?
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.360]   The computer's not working and it's like, you know, I can't because if I started doing
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.040]   that, I'd be stopping at Aunt Petunia's house every, you know, everybody's house every day.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.880]   But you're, you need a friend who could do it.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   And if you're not, you're really out of luck.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.480]   Well, there's nothing we could do about it.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.760]   Let's just, everybody should buy more computers and then demand better.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   Demand better.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.760]   I don't know what the solution is.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.760]   What is this?
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   Go ahead.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.440]   You, I know what you're going to want to know about the live birth on quick.com.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   No, no, I thought that that wasn't interesting.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.920]   But we'll also talk about what?
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   What do you, what do you think it's just?
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.640]   Well, that you were going to find out after you tell us about.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.960]   Go to, go to meeting.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   Go to meeting.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   Go to meeting.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   That would you were talking.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   That's what you were thinking.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.440]   I want to talk about, Mitnick says he's going to hack Obama's Blackberry.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.040]   I want to talk about that.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.560]   And I want to talk about, oh, the new camera phones.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   Wow.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   Ooh.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.800]   But first I want to tell you about go to meeting our good friends at Citrix.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:17.960]   Really know how to make your computer easier to use to make your computer a tool for sales,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.040]   for training, for collaboration.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.480]   Go to meeting is just the pinnacle of this.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.080]   And it's gotten better and better and better on it.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.960]   If you haven't tried it lately, I want you to try it right now.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   In fact, if you've tried other online meeting software, I really want you to try Go to meeting
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.600]   because this is not like the other stuff.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.400]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.000]   That's the place to go.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.520]   You could try it free for 30 days.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.920]   I'm not going to ask you to pay for it without trying it.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.120]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.320]   You'll see, first of all, before this shows over, you'll have installed.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.000]   You can start with a couple of clicks of the mouse in a minute or two.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.920]   And then the next time you're on a conference call, here's all you got to do is say, go
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.400]   to Go to meeting.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   You set up the meeting.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.840]   It's a couple of clicks of the mouse and you say, okay, now go to Go to meeting.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   They enter it and all of a sudden they're seeing your computer.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.400]   You say, now see what I'm talking about?
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   See here's the presentation.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.400]   Here's the PowerPoint.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   Here's the...
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.040]   Or let's work together on a document or...
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.800]   Here I'm going to show you how to use this program.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   Now you can use it.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.680]   It's the kind of thing you can use to help your friends, to sell more, to train, to
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   collaborate, and it's free.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.840]   Why not try it?
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.360]   Come on, go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.200]   If you decide to stick with it, it is the most affordable solution out there.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.480]   One low flat monthly rate for as many meetings as long as you want.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.000]   You don't have to count the minutes or any of that stuff.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   It's secure.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   It's easy to use.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.160]   It's fast.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.400]   And if you haven't tried, go to meeting lately or if you've worse, if you tried that other
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.200]   guy, go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.680]   Trust me, it's the best.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.760]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Tech.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.440]   I really like the guys at Citrix, their old friends and they do great stuff.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.080]   So you don't think it's a big deal?
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.600]   I think it's a great big deal.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.040]   Actually I should ask you, Molly, you're a mother.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:59.840]   What if your husband had said, "Honey, there's 500 people watching you right now give birth.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.360]   Give me a little shout out."
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.200]   I cannot even imagine.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.760]   I actually did a bit about this on the buzz report and was just like, "You've got to
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   be kidding me."
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:13.000]   Presumably as soon as this woman recovered from birth, she threw a garbage can at this
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   guy.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.600]   "Yeah, we'll kill you son of a link."
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.440]   My wife was mad at me anyway.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.440]   She said, "You got me into this, you son of a dick."
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.920]   And if I'd been videoing it, that would have been.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.040]   But let alone, this is more than videoing it.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.360]   This is streaming it.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   It's ridiculous.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.840]   I mean, I'm assuming that she's in on it and okay with it.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   But I don't know.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.720]   I mean, if this is the first baby, I don't think you have any clue.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720]   I just know.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   Just know.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.520]   There's the question of just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.920]   Shouldn't like be illegal.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.720]   You can put whatever you want on the internet.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.240]   But for God's sake, people have some self respect.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.880]   It's a baby.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.320]   What's interesting here to me is that the headline is another baby birth streamed.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.440]   How many times is this going on?
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.320]   This is the second one that I know of because we did the thing on the buzz report a couple
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   weeks ago.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   I did a news stream.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.120]   What happens if it becomes a fad?
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.120]   Can you imagine?
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.760]   This was a C-section.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.600]   Mommy, mommy, how come I wasn't on the stream when I was born?
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.600]   Didn't you love me?
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.520]   How come you didn't stream my birth?
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.840]   There will be a new, it'll be the new bumper sticker.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.480]   My child was a live stream birth.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.120]   Live stream birth.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.360]   We break for live streamed births.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.360]   The nurse said turn it off, sir.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   And he didn't.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   The nurse knew.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   The nurse knew.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   The nurse knew.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.000]   But you know, I have to admit that I think this is a way that anxious fathers are handling
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.680]   their anxiety.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:48.120]   I remember that now my daughter was born in '92, so we didn't have that much.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.600]   But we had hypercard.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.400]   And I made a hypercard stack that would time the contractions.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.920]   Every time I pressed the space, "What a nerd!"
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.680]   So I said, "Honey, are you having a contraction?
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   Is it now?
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   Now?
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   Now?"
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.760]   And I pressed the space bar, but it didn't work so well.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:10.360]   But Amber MacArthur, who just had a baby a couple of weeks ago, she said we used the
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   iPhone contraction timer.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360]   No.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   Oh, really?
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.400]   I was there first!
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.960]   If only I'd commercialized the product.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.760]   Whatever happened to you, you could have actually made a patent.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.600]   I could have made a buck.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.680]   Whatever happened to Pat and the hypercard.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.000]   You know, it just kind of withered on the vine.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.640]   There were clones made.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.840]   You remember how important and how big a deal that was?
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.720]   I mean, it really made it the first one that you could really easily write software for
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.920]   a Mac, graphical stuff.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   It was very cool.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   But it's long gone.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.680]   Talk about dying on the vine.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.080]   Yeah, there's a lot of stuff like that.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.880]   You know, fortunately, I have no short-term memory, so I don't remember it.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.720]   But, you know, every once in a while I'll read a story and I'll go, oh yeah, I remember
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   that.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.520]   So here's a story that I was thinking of instead of...
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:07.040]   This one, Canon has no sense of humor tries to shut down fake Chuck Westfall blog update
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.560]   and fails.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.560]   What is this?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.640]   So Chuck Westfall is he the CEO of Kehueh, who is Chuck Westfall?
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   I don't know.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.080]   Well, I know, according to this picture on the Thomas Hawks digital connection, he's some
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.680]   looks like a guy who should be doing, you know, those documentaries about the...
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.680]   Chuck Westfall.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   That's a joke.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:30.760]   Chuck Westfall is the technical information advisor for the camera marketing work.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.640]   So he's like the point man to help you with Canon issues.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   I think so, yeah.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   Or to...
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.640]   I mean, he's a marketing guy.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   Apparently, he's well known.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.960]   It says in the photography community, he's interviewed a lot about photography and photographic
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.240]   equipment, magazines, online.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.240]   So he's sort of a...
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.880]   And this is where it gets a little sticky.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.840]   He's a slight public figure.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.200]   Oh, he's not like if it was fake Obama blog or fake Steve Jobs, you can't do anything
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   about it.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   But because this guy is maybe not a...
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   No, I don't know.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   I think Molly should indicate...
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.600]   Well, no, I'm saying that I think he kind of is.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.360]   I think if he is, in fact, a public face of Canon, then I think that they have almost
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   no other...
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   He's fair game.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   He's fair game.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   It's not like they didn't say fake.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   It's in the name.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   Right.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.360]   That too.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.200]   So it says, here's the main objections that Canon seems to have as cited.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:22.560]   I'm sorry, this sentence, I just don't like it.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   But anyway...
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   Always the writer.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   No, I'm just...
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   That's not writing.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   It's typing.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.240]   That's not writing.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   That's typing.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   This is...
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   This sentence needs some comments.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:40.560]   Number one, the fact that fake Chuck is using the Canon stylized logo, which there's
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   some maybe, but again, this is a parody.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.080]   For the humor is always protected, by the way.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.400]   Threats of physical violence against our client and employees.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   What is that?
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.240]   An invasion of privacy and the overall look feel in the tone of the blog is calculated
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   to mislead.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.240]   Isn't the word fake used here?
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.240]   Over and over.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   How is that misleading, anybody?
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.520]   I mean, well, and they took down the logo.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.480]   They were like, all right, well, maybe the one even remotely legitimate argument you have
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.520]   here is that we're using a trademark logo.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.960]   So goodbye to the logo.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.280]   And now we're all good.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.800]   I love it because WordPress.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.600]   It's on WordPress.com.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.880]   And WordPress stood up for the blogger, which I really think is great.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.480]   They wrote back saying the owner has removed the Canon logo.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:29.120]   We consider the privacy complaint about the names of Chuck's wife and child voids, since
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.400]   he mentions them in his own biography.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   There you go.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   Online biography.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:41.000]   We also reject your other complaints regarding the blog being confused because that says fake.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.600]   And the about page actually starts with high.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.720]   I'm not actually Chuck Westfall.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   And it's satire.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.400]   So good for WordPress really kind of stood up to Canon on that.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.000]   Well, no, they can't afford not to because if everybody has a petty grievance against
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.600]   every little thing that's tries to be funny on the internet and there's plenty of that,
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.440]   they would be spending all their time fighting this stuff one way or the other and they would
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.360]   get a bad reputation from their user.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.800]   So they had to do this, but I do agree.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   Good for them.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.400]   But the fact that Canon has got to stick up its butt over this thing.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   Well, the funny thing is.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.520]   The humiliation I think to the company itself, they should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   The funny thing.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   A shame to themselves.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.720]   The humor of it is I never heard of Chuck Westfall.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   Me neither.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.000]   I never heard of the blog, but I'm reading it now.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I know.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.560]   I mean, I literally saw this in thought.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.320]   I had public relations done by a Japanese company.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.960]   You just think like, who is this guy?
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.960]   And you know what?
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:38.980]   There are certain companies that have this goal and that goal is to control every single
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:43.440]   bit of information that that bleeds out about them and it is absolutely ludicrous that
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:48.680]   they wouldn't have someone inside the company who would say, look, this is a not a legally
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.600]   viable argument and be it's going to backfire in a phenomenal way because have you ever visited
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   the internet?
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   Who?
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:00.480]   I mean, really, they need to get some serious like internet advisors in the company.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   Like have you met the internet?
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   You don't want to do this.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   It's going to be bad.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   I don't get it.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.880]   You mentioned how people how long is the year here.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.780]   Wait, wait, that's a good book title.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.980]   I'll try to do that for fail.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.620]   I think you could have written have you met the internet, but I think you would have
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:21.420]   written it in like 1995 because it's a little late for that.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.420]   You're right.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   Okay.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.420]   Never mind.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.260]   But no, no, no, could the subtitle could be an introduction for clueless companies?
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.260]   It is.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.260]   Exactly.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.260]   Let me write that.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.260]   No, no, no, no, that's only mine.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.260]   It hit.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   No, that is beautiful.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.260]   That is a blog post waiting to happen.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.260]   It's all yours.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:41.720]   There are so many companies still to this day who have a tin ear about this whole thing
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.960]   who fight this stuff and end up making it far worse.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.380]   Monster is an excellent example.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   Yeah, they sue.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.880]   Well, who do they sue?
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   Everyone.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.580]   The latest was the mini golf company because they have the word monster in the name.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:00.100]   It's a monster cable or monster.com monster cable is the one who sues everybody.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:04.500]   They sued monster blue jeans because of over rivets in the blue.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:10.060]   I mean, they are just out of hand and they're really torpedoing their reputation.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.380]   Certainly in the geek community, they've lost it entirely.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.740]   And I guess if you're monster cable, that's kind of important.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.780]   Who else is going to buy that overpriced crap?
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.020]   Maybe that's it because they know the geek community thinks that.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.020]   So it's like, well, we already lost those guys.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.020]   Okay.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.020]   Let's go for the dummy.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.940]   We can't charge 90 bucks for an HDMI cable.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.860]   Those guys, they know too much.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.020]   It's pretty funny.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.500]   I think companies often say, well, if you don't defend a trademark, you'll lose it, but not
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.100]   against a blue jean company or a mini golf company.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.700]   No, it has confusion.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.100]   Yeah, no, absolutely not.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.180]   It's ridiculous.
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:50.140]   And they are if in fact you had to defend it as violently as a monster has, then you
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.980]   would see this kind of behavior all the time.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.740]   It's like monster cable is the only company who is acting this vehemently about their
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:56.980]   defending their trademark.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.220]   So it's obviously not the requirement.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:03.260]   I don't know how far back you go as a writer, Molly, but there was something that happened.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:09.540]   I think it was starting to show up in like the mid 1980s where you'd get a press release
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:14.060]   during the days of the press release and you'd read this press release and every other every
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.620]   mention of the company's name had a trademark thing next to it.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.020]   So it's like that of that trademark.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.820]   That is trademark trademark trademark.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:24.460]   And the whole thing was so filled with these little trademark things, which are unnecessary
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.460]   and stupid.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:26.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.540]   And it was like a trend.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   And it was like this weird trend.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:32.380]   And somebody said, hey, you only have to do the trademark thing once if at all.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.820]   And they finally realized you can put it down at the bottom.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.940]   And then remember that there would be these long paragraphs at the bottom of these things
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.460]   that say Microsoft Windows is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.860]   Sony is a trademark of Sony.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:43.860]   Do they still do that?
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.860]   And they stopped doing that too?
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:45.860]   I don't know.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.740]   You'll see it sometimes at the bottom of emails and then it will also include the confidential
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.740]   and private.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   I like that one.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.820]   If you're reading this in your Mylon era, please destroy it now and try to forget you
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:56.820]   ever saw.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.820]   Like, pal.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:58.820]   Right.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.140]   I think what's I think what these companies don't realize is not only do they have a 10
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:07.020]   year when it comes to understanding the internet response, they don't know there's going to
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.020]   be an internet response.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:12.660]   I think they really still live in such a bubble that they think they can send out an
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.460]   email or a legal notice to a blogger.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.500]   And that blogger is going to pee his pants and take the site down.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:20.060]   And those days are long gone.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.060]   Are they?
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.540]   I mean, look, I'm I would be scared.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:27.620]   I don't have the money that monster has or Canada has to fight it.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.140]   Yeah, but you can get.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:33.220]   I mean, you can get is EFF going to come and defend you free.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:37.780]   You might get enough responses on Twitter alone to get a case.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.780]   At least a good letter.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.780]   It's a process server.
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:44.420]   No, I was going to come up there and serve you.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.780]   They won't be able to find you.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.820]   That you're kidding people.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.620]   One are in here all the time.
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.380]   Nobody knows when they only have few people.
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.460]   I don't think any process servers ever going to do it.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.020]   If somebody comes up to you, Leo says, are you Leo LePorte?
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.020]   Just say no.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.020]   Oh, good.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.020]   Is that your technique?
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.740]   John, you know, I don't get served.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.740]   It's funny.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.740]   Does that work?
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.860]   By the way, if the processor can't serve you, are you not served?
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.900]   I mean, if you avoid them, you're not.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.740]   That seems like you're that seems like a 10 year old playing that game.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.780]   Oh, you didn't catch me.
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.980]   There's there's some truth to it in certain situations.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.140]   I guess I have to serve you.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.140]   Somebody has to serve you.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.140]   Somebody has to, again, they can do it in different ways, but you can't.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.940]   You can't, but you can't add it.
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.660]   You show up at court and say, where's Leo LePorte?
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.980]   He's, well, you're, you're suing him.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.660]   He says, well, we couldn't get ahold of him.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.100]   What are the judges going to say to that?
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.460]   He ran away, your honor.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460]   He ran away.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.500]   I couldn't get him.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.740]   The bell rang.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.700]   That's the best part of pineapple expresses right at the beginning where he's a process
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.060]   server and all the tricks he uses to serve people.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:55.500]   I do wonder, but I do wonder if, because I only have ever seen serving stuff in the movies.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.140]   Like I wonder if any of that stuff is true.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.140]   Right.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.140]   I serve somebody once.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.140]   Were you a process server?
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.100]   No, I was, I was given the assignment to serve and I did.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.100]   Really?
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.140]   And it's done as exactly the way it looks like in the movies.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.100]   What the movies are showing you is exactly what you do.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.900]   You find the person you go, you know, like it'd be you.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.900]   Leo LePorte?
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:16.900]   Here.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.420]   And you get in the piece of paper and then you walk away.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   Oh, man.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:20.420]   You're a little bit old.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   What?
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   What a minute.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.420]   Who are you working for that they made you serve him?
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.420]   I know.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.420]   What?
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.420]   You've got stories.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.420]   I did voluntarily on some situation where somebody needed to be served and I knew I
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   could do it.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:30.420]   Were you ever a bounty hunter?
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.420]   Come on.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:32.420]   I admit it.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.420]   You have leathers.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.420]   Dog.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.500]   Devorac dog.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.060]   And another book.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.060]   I'd be scared.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.500]   We've got a couple of situations.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.980]   If we serve somebody on some other thing, I mean, you can, I mean, you don't have to be
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:50.980]   a process server to serve, you know, you can, you know, anybody can.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.580]   But you do have to make right.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.980]   You have to, you would have to testify to the person, you know, refused to show up.
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:01.780]   Interesting that they were served on December 15th at 11.42 a.m.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.780]   We'll do it at the deficit.
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:08.420]   John C. Devorac with a subpoena, an appearing card on.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.420]   It doesn't.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.420]   That's, I wouldn't want it.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   That's like being a meter made.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.620]   I really wouldn't want that job.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.620]   No, I don't know.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.620]   It was a job.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.620]   I think it pays well.
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.620]   Maybe not.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.420]   Some people can tell us.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.420]   Boba Fett.
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.020]   And they will.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.980]   Twitter raises another $35 million.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.140]   It's almost like it fell in their lap.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.420]   They said we didn't really need the money, but well, somebody offered us $35 million.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.540]   We'll take it.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.340]   That is not happening to me these days.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.340]   No, nobody ever offers me $35 million.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:38.580]   I understand they're now valued at more than a quarter of a billion dollars.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.580]   Valued.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.100]   Well, it sure is shot up in usage.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.100]   It is up.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.100]   I just saw a link.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.780]   It's up over 900% in the last year.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.780]   Is that what this is?
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:48.780]   Yeah, I believe it.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.780]   Yeah, 900%.
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.060]   And sometimes people say, oh, it's spam.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.420]   And there is a lot of spam now, but it's not spam.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:55.980]   The real world has arrived.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.980]   That's what they were doing.
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:57.980]   Huge.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:01.260]   The celebrity factor alone, I think, is shooting up the Twitter user.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.260]   The user base.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.620]   I mean, I can't believe everywhere I turn there's some other famous person on Twitter.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.540]   I am now Lance Armstrong has lapped me.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.580]   I'm now like number 12 on Twitter.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:11.580]   You're doomed.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.580]   I'm doomed.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:16.180]   You know, we're going to be bragging about being in the top 100 before this is over.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:18.740]   Hey, I wish lunch number one on Twitter.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.740]   I have fallen out of the top 100.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.740]   My heart is broken.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.420]   I mean, like in the top 300 now.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.420]   I got to seven.
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.980]   And that's what I say.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:30.020]   But you know, I'm saying something that you can have 87,000 followers and still be number
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.020]   12 on the list.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.620]   I mean, Steven Fry now has 183,000 followers.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.860]   Kevin's 126,000.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.660]   Britney Spears, 112,000.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.660]   Ah, she's the one I predicted would bring it up to.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.780]   It's not even her and everybody knows it's not her, but they still follow her.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:49.660]   Yeah, wassey is number is number eight.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.660]   That's Jonathan Ross.
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:53.140]   He's a presenter of apparently very well known in Britain.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.500]   The Brits have invaded.
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.860]   It's the British invasion.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   Part the British.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.380]   It's the British celebrity invasion.
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:04.100]   Well, I think, you know, once you get past a certain number, you know, 10,000 is probably
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.300]   a good number.
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.180]   You have a pretty good group of followers that you can you can crowd source.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.900]   I mean, you don't really need 100,000 followers.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.740]   I keep telling myself.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.220]   What are you going to do with them?
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.220]   Come on.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.220]   You know, crowd source.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.220]   And I did that recently.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.740]   And you know, Horowitz and I do this little podcast on the stock market and we needed a
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:29.380]   logo for the I tunes and I just crowd sourced and I said, can anybody design this little,
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:33.140]   you know, album cover art and we, and they came over and he's in it decent ones.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.100]   And I said, well, then I said, let's vote on it.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:40.460]   And I threw my, you know, threw it out to the, to the Twitter, Twitter followers, just which
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.780]   one you want number one, two or three.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:46.100]   And so I thought it would be, it was somewhat amusing because there would be these tweets
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:53.020]   coming in, you know, one, two, one, you know, so I mean, basically there's all these tweets
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.020]   were just the number.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:58.980]   I mean, I, I think that people watching this will go, what they, what, what is this?
[00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.980]   Sometimes that'll happen.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:03.260]   You'll be reading Twitter and it's just like incomprehensible nonsense comes across.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.660]   It's like, I know something's going on.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.660]   I don't, I'm not a party to it.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.260]   Well, if you go late enough at night, it's always in Japanese.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.300]   Yeah, that's fun too.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.460]   The middle of the night Twittering.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.900]   But I've never, I think I've gone to that, the Twitter front page, like two or three
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900]   times.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.780]   I mean, the thing is it just doesn't, I don't know.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.780]   I don't know.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:25.140]   I don't understand the, I don't understand the impulse to keep throwing money at Twitter
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.020]   without at least asking them to say just one time.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.220]   Is there any plan at all?
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.220]   Is there a plan?
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.900]   Any plan, anything at all.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.340]   Any thought of monetizing anything.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:37.580]   Even beyond that, like, you know what, I'm past the, we have a plan stage and now we
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.180]   need to know what the age is the plan.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.180]   What is the plan?
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.180]   Seriously.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.780]   There's light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.860]   It's just, it's the weird, no one ever, I mean, imagine being a person, right?
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.540]   Like I joke about no one ever does this to me.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.660]   But imagine if people just came up and kept giving me money, like, honey, you got potential.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.900]   You, you are going to be beautiful for something.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.460]   Here's $20 million.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.460]   Like what the hell is that?
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.460]   You know, it's amazing.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.460]   Why are these people?
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:06.140]   And this is in a time when everybody's saying there's no money to be had, no venture funding.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.100]   Everybody's, you know, dying.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.740]   They keep getting more money.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.460]   Yeah, it's ludicrous.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.700]   They really like no offense to Twitter, but what the hell?
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.380]   They have magic Jedi Mojo.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.380]   That's all I can think.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.380]   All right.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:24.380]   So we, I mentioned this before we always seem to get caught up on Twitter.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.380]   Chitchat is amazing.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.540]   Well, here there's, there's because it's a story.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.540]   35 million.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.660]   And then here Pete Hek, Hoekstra.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.940]   Congressman Hoekstra from Michigan.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.780]   He's a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.740]   He's in Iraq on a top secret congressional envoy.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.980]   And he's Twittering just landed in Baghdad.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.460]   I believe it may be the first time I've had BB service in Iraq.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.460]   His blackberry, right?
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.460]   11 hour trip here.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:54.220]   Moved and moved into green zone by helicopter Iraqi flag now over palace headed to new U.S.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220]   embassy.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.300]   This guy's pretty lucky that they're shutting down Gitmo.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.820]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.420]   The Pentagon was not happy.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.780]   Well, I'll see what darishes it makes.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.380]   He was Twittering along the route though.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.380]   And where he was?
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.980]   Yeah, but how many Al Qaeda's on Twitter?
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.780]   Here's his everyone's on Twitter.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.020]   I'm sure there's at least one guy.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.460]   Yes, you are the Al Qaeda social media expert.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.740]   Your job is to follow Twitter.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.700]   As the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, his spokesman said, is that your
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.700]   Arab?
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.580]   I mean, I want, you know, I didn't want to go all the way on that one.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.980]   I thought I'd hold back a little bit.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.500]   I don't think you've got the Arab down.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.660]   No, I have it, but I don't want to do it.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.180]   I don't want to be seen as racist.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.980]   Well, how's it racist?
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.740]   It's no more racist than any of the other acts.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.420]   It's like, they're all racist.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.100]   They're all bad.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:49.940]   As the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, this is a Congressman Hoekstra's
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.740]   spokesperson.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.540]   The congressman is fully aware of security issues when traveling abroad.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:00.020]   He believes in giving people the people of West Michigan as much access as possible and
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.660]   posting on Twitter allows him to provide real time insight into the sights and sounds
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.060]   of his congressional activities.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.980]   Brother.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.980]   He's still Twittering.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.180]   He Twitter is all the time several times a day.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.700]   And when the vote was going on on the stimulus bill, Congressman Culberson was Twittering
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.140]   at like 12 or 15 times an hour saying, I don't have time.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   I don't have time to read the bill.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.140]   I don't have time to read the bill.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:35.020]   It's pretty interesting though because we do want, you know, we geeks stop non talk nonstop
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.580]   about transparency.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.580]   We want that.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.580]   We do.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.060]   And yet this guy comes off like a total idiot.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.780]   There's some places you probably don't want to be Twittering from.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.220]   And even those of us in our own lives have that.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.580]   Hey, John, I'm getting some echo from you.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.300]   Are you, uh, let me turn you down.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.060]   Yeah, I'm getting, I hear myself back.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.060]   Okay.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.060]   How is that?
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   Whatever John wants to start playing sound effects down the road.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.660]   All of a sudden we hear echoes because I know he's about to do something.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.100]   You don't listen to us on headphones, John.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:08.100]   You know, I should, but I don't want to do this because I'm doing other things.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.980]   The, um, your ears itch.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.300]   Well, that's flattering.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:16.060]   I should wear headphones, but I find them annoying.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:21.780]   You know, I worked on, have you ever worked on any radio shows where the guy, like a talk
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.660]   show and the guy doesn't use headphones and he doesn't expect you to use them?
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.900]   Yeah, I find it very disconcerting because actually like it.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.900]   It's very disconcerting.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.500]   I like the headphones a lot.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   But you know, if you're in the same room as the person, you don't, you don't really
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.020]   need them.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.420]   And then I guess they use a little speaker for the phone call.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.620]   Well, you do need them if you want to modulate your voice.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.620]   Did Larry kiss?
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.620]   Yes, that's right.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:44.100]   And I use headphones for that very reason.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.220]   Did Larry King wear headphones when you did the Larry King?
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.540]   I don't recall him wearing headphones.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.900]   I don't think he did.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.740]   The old guys, the really old guys in radio would hang, they'd have this thing that would
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.740]   hang on their ear.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:55.900]   It wasn't headphones.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:01.300]   It was like a speaker, a little speaker that would hang on their ear and they would listen
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.300]   and you could hear it was so loud.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.300]   You could hear a little, you know, like a little transistor radios on there.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.300]   You could hear it.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.820]   And I know there were deaf in that ear.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.460]   It was like piercing.
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.060]   Anyway, let's take a break.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.020]   Because I think we want to talk in just a bit about this new Sony camera and the new
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.180]   Samsung camera.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.140]   We've done our Twittering stories.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.460]   Let's see what else.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.420]   How would you pay for YouTube?
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:35.660]   There's a move afoot to charge you to watch movies on YouTube and the hackable blackberry.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.380]   But first I got to tell you about audible.com.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.820]   Have we got you listening to Audible yet, Molly?
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.700]   Oh, I'm a total Audible user.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.500]   I think when you're a mom and you know you have your hands full and you're, you know,
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.980]   shopping for diapers at Costco, Audible's a lifesaver.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.980]   What do you listen to?
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   What kind of stuff you like?
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.980]   Fiction, nonfiction.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.540]   I was just cracking up at the thought of myself in Costco with my iPhone.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:01.780]   I like to listen to espionage action thrillers.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.780]   Oh, cool.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.580]   That is like my favorite audio book genre.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.500]   So I'm all about the Robert Ludlam books.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   Ludlams great.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.940]   One after the other after the other.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.940]   Bring them on.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.740]   And they're big and thick so they last a long time.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   Exactly.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:13.740]   Like that.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.740]   Yes.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.380]   Crunchy bars or something.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.380]   Nothing.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   Never mind.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.380]   Forget I said that.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:23.060]   And, okay, Ludlam anything else?
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:24.060]   Any other?
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.060]   I love Ludlam.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.300]   I haven't read all of this stuff though.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   I have to go back.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.060]   You'd like all the born books and all that stuff.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.060]   I do.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.780]   It's just a nice big catalog of audiobook and I am digging it.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.780]   That's what's cool.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.420]   And then I have been, I admit I'm taking a brief break from audible because I've been
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.380]   on this weird actual book kick.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.980]   But I think I'm going back.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.380]   No, no, no, that can't happen.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.740]   I know it's got to stop.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:44.740]   It's fun.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.540]   You know, it's actually kind of fun.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.940]   Everyone's going to pick up a book and go, wow, I haven't seen one of these in a while.
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:56.780]   Between the Kindle and audible, it's like, ooh, you look, the page is crisp, crumple.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.460]   It's kind of funny.
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:06:59.900]   It smells so interesting.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.900]   What does that smell?
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.900]   I want to take.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.460]   Oh, I forgot it smelled like that.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.420]   What are you reading in the hardcover genre?
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.900]   I just actually closed the book on outliers, just finished like the last.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.060]   Isn't that a great book?
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.100]   Yeah, it was really interesting.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.100]   Now see, I'm listening to the Malcolm Gladwell audible version of it.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.580]   And he's great.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.660]   He really gives it life as he's reading it.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.980]   It's really fun to listen to it.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.420]   Have you ever seen him speak?
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.140]   No, I would love to though.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.300]   I hear he's a great speaker.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   I haven't.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.540]   Have you seen, well, John's off doing his dinner.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.540]   I won't talk to John.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.540]   I'm not supposed to talk to John during the commercials.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.580]   He uses these as an opportunity to do something.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580]   I don't know.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.580]   Good to know.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.580]   Yeah, just a word of warning.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:45.580]   Don't ref-
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.580]   The bathroom.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.580]   I knew it.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.580]   I knew it.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.580]   I wasn't going to say it, John.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.580]   It's okay.
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:51.580]   No, he cooks dinner.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.140]   So actually they have Blink in English, but they also have a rather, they have outliers
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.340]   in English, but they also have Blink in Spanish.
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.420]   You know how you say Blink in Spanish?
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:01.980]   Oh, Blink.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.220]   And they have the tipping point in Spanish.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.020]   El Punto clave.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.020]   I like that.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:10.620]   I didn't know they had all those Spanish books.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.620]   Audibles.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.780]   51,000 titles, science fiction, fact.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.340]   The new Christopher Morges came out.
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.340]   We've talked about him.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.340]   He's a listener.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.340]   Hi, Christopher.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.340]   It's called Fool.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.940]   He's, he wrote, you suck and blood sucking themes and coyote blues.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.460]   New one is called Fool, a novel.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.660]   Actually, this is an exclusive.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.420]   You have to be an audible member to get this on.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.580]   I'm going to make this my recommendation.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.780]   This is so good.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:48.340]   Christopher Morges, funny arch clever and a Geeks best friend is new book is called Fool.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:51.020]   It's about the Fool and King Lear, actually.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.020]   Wow.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.020]   Like from the Fool's perspective.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.020]   Interesting.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.020]   I like books like that.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.460]   I don't know why there's a lot of books like I think it's a great genre.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:07.140]   Get it right now by going to audible.com/twit and you can get a, any book for free, a credit

[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:25.420]   And you know, just, it's a wonderful, wonderful resource for reading.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:29.460]   If you're a new mom and you want to listen while you're, you know, you're doing all those
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:35.900]   chores or if you're, I listen in the gym, I listen in the car, audible.com.

[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.820]   And actually, you know, that may sound like a lot of first, believe me, it's not nearly
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.820]   enough.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:50.420]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:55.340]   Great people and a great, and by the way, I'm very happy to say we just got the note.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.420]   Audible has signed up for another, I think another six months with, with Twits.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.460]   We're very happy to have them in the fold.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.060]   They're very supportive, which is kind of nice because, you know, you might think we're
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.420]   almost in competition, right?
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.700]   Like, well, if they listen to Twit, are they listening to our books?
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.700]   I know, congratulations.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.380]   Yeah, I'm really happy about that.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.380]   That's great news.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:19.020]   Despite the economic so-called downturn, which I know a lot of our friends are out of
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.860]   work, it's really breaking my heart.
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.340]   Stuff like this seems to be doing okay.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.220]   Why is that loud steam to be doing okay?
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.140]   Yeah, that shows doing, no, I'm just going to think that it's doing all right now.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:34.340]   So did Natalie Del Connie kind of take your spot?
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.460]   A little bit, yeah.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.460]   You do it Mondays.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.460]   I do it Mondays.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.420]   I mean, she did take over as the full-time co-host for now.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.540]   I love Natalie, but I miss you.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.340]   Oh, thank you.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.100]   That's a common sentiment.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.220]   Yeah, you and Tom and Jason, it was just such a great show.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.540]   You were really the heart and soul of the show from day one.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]   And I do miss you.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.900]   It's still a great show and I wreck him.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:59.260]   Whenever anybody sends me hate mail, which happens once in a while, they go, "That twit,
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.260]   you suck.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.220]   You talk about Twitter too much, whatever."
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.020]   I say, "You know, and I'm sincere.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.180]   There is another show you'll probably like better.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.860]   They cover the news, they do a great job.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:12.540]   It's daily, it's called Buzz Out Loud, and you're going to love it."
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:13.980]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.100]   I do another podcast I've ever seen that actually called Gadgets.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.100]   I love that.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:24.060]   It's like a total gadget show from the female perspective where we really, that's our total
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.260]   goof-off show.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.260]   Who's on that?
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.740]   For the people who like the twit thing, we wander.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:32.620]   That is Kelly Morrison and then Jason Howell from Buzz.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.620]   Fantastic.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.620]   Gadgets.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.980]   Is he a gadget or is he an honorary gadget?
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.740]   He's our gender gap guy.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.300]   He's like there to keep us.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.500]   We have a whole segment actually called Gender Gap that is just like gadgets that dudes think
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.660]   are awesome.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.660]   That's so funny.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.660]   Yeah, it's a really fun show.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.100]   It's not just for women either.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.100]   No.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.100]   Best place to go to cnet.com/molly.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.460]   You'll find all of Molly's stuff there.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.540]   Have you talked about these new camera phones yet?
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.500]   I know because they have come out since we recorded.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.300]   His chest was announced.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.100]   And they're hot.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100]   Very interesting.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.740]   So it starts with what?
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.740]   And he's back.
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.140]   Welcome back, John C. Devorak.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.380]   It starts with the Samsung, let's see, no, I guess the first one.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   It was the Samsung.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.380]   The Samsung Memoir.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.380]   Pro megapixel.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.460]   No, the Memoir is eight megapixels.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.660]   You're going to start with it.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:24.660]   Little one.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.660]   So pathetic.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   Pathetic.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:33.060]   The Samsung Memoir, but that's going to be out in 10 days.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.780]   That's going to be out on T-Mobile.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.420]   It looks a lot like it has a full screen, touch screen, very much iPhone-y, but eight
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.060]   megapixels, which is kind of mind-blowing.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:48.620]   And then Sony Ericsson announces their E-Doo 12 megapixels.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.740]   12 megapixels of blur.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.380]   Well, that's the question.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.700]   It's more than megapixels, obviously.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.940]   But I don't know.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.940]   Sony does good cameras.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.500]   Let's look at this objectively.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.580]   How big can the sensor possibly be in these things, considering if you look at the size
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.500]   of the lens?
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:12.660]   So it's got to be something that's got no contrast, no signal-to-noise ratio that's
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.660]   worth a powder.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.460]   It's like a crap.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.460]   It's a crap pixel.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.380]   A crap pixel.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.340]   A crap-a-pixel.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.420]   The Memoir is interesting because it's autofocus.
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.740]   It's got a real flash.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.060]   Not one of those phony flashes.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:31.860]   It's got a xenon flash.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]   It's got...
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:37.580]   This one's got anti-shake, which I think is anti-shake.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.580]   You know what?
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.580]   That's digital anti-shake.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.220]   Probably not optical.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.220]   You're right.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.420]   In fact, the zoom is optical.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.340]   Digital is not optical.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:49.740]   But I think autofocus is great because autofocus allows you to do things like take pictures
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.740]   of barcodes.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:51.740]   That's what I like about the G1.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.820]   Take pictures of barcodes.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:57.460]   And then you could send it back to the server and it'll say, "Hey, you can get this cheaper
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   down the street."
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.380]   I love that.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:03.420]   That is the coolest app on the G1.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   That and latitude.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:05.660]   Latitude is pretty cool too.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:08.700]   If you played with that, that's the new Google one that follows you around everywhere.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.700]   I don't want that.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.700]   I don't want that.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.260]   I sort of refuse to install that.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.820]   No, it brings me out.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820]   Well, the difference...
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.580]   I guess the difference between this is something like Bright-Cut.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.580]   Bright-Cut, you explicitly push a button and say, "I'm here now."
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.580]   This...
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:24.420]   Yeah, there's a map and as you move around, you move around on the map, always.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.140]   I don't need Google to know that.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:27.140]   No.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.140]   It is a little creepy, but I...
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   And...
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   Am I an exhibitionist?
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.300]   Because I kind of like this.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.340]   Is there a latitude Facebook app yet?
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:35.340]   Because that is excellent.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.340]   Oh yeah.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:37.340]   That's a good point.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.060]   You can just have a little app on your profile and everyone can see where you are at any
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.060]   given moment.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.060]   You're a little doc.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.060]   It's crazy.
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.060]   Moving around.
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.060]   Oh, look.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.500]   And somebody said, "You know, the first thing that's going to happen, some guy's going
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.260]   to install this on his phone and he's going to tell his wife he went to the ball game.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:51.700]   Instead, he's down at the massage parlor and it's going to be all over."
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.780]   That thing is terrifying.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.940]   I refuse to install it or try it.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   What is wrong with me that I think...
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.940]   I know that's Adam Curry.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:00.940]   That's what we like to know.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.980]   There's been wondering about you, Leo.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.660]   I've installed it and I sent out an invitation.
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.060]   I think I sent you guys an invitation.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.060]   Say, "Follow me."
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:10.100]   I think you've got some sort of a death wish.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.100]   Follow me literally.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.100]   Follow me.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.100]   Literally.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.020]   You can know where I am at every moment.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:19.140]   The only problem with it is that the Google phone has like a five minute battery life.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.620]   So you can only follow me for a little while.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.540]   But apparently they're doing an iPhone application that's going to even be better.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.540]   I think these...
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.620]   I think actually speaking of phones.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:32.620]   I think these are the kinds of features that they're the only hope for phone makers who
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.380]   are really trying to compete with that overall iPhone usefulness.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.300]   It's like you can appeal to people now in a niche category.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.220]   Like, "Well, okay, you have a phone that does it all."
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.060]   But you also really like photography.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.060]   Coaching.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.060]   No, exactly.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.940]   In fact, I think I said that on the radio show.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.780]   They tried to compete against the iPhone.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.780]   It's getting harder and harder.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.180]   The app store is so good.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.660]   The usability, the interface.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.380]   It's just they can't compete.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:59.900]   But at least they could say, "Hey, we've got a 12 megapixel camera."
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:00.900]   Right.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.900]   I agree with you exactly.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.900]   I think you hit the nail on the head.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.940]   It's almost them saying, "We give up."
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:07.940]   We can't...
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:08.940]   Maybe.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:13.220]   Or we're making an end run at best or at minimum.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.700]   Pricing on the Samsung Memo on T-Mobile.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:21.740]   $250 with a two year contract.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.220]   It kind of looks nice.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.540]   But I'm a Sony Ericsson fan because I like the Symbian OS.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.540]   I guess 60.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.620]   I don't know about 12 megapixels though.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620]   You're right, John.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.980]   On a tiny chip, more megapixels actually is worse.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:37.260]   I think the 8 megapixel and all this sort of advanced camera features, that sounds a little
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.260]   bit better to me.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.260]   The memoir sounds a little better.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:42.500]   Although, and to be honest, I would rather have all the awesome utility.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.180]   Like I'm really excited about the Palm Pre.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.180]   Are you?
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:48.660]   I am too, but I'm holding off until I see it.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.660]   Well, yeah.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.660]   I'm not going to do anything wrong.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.660]   You know what the pre-means don't...
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.660]   What a pre-stance for?
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.220]   No, what?
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.220]   Pre-bank ripsy.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.220]   Can I do?
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:02.580]   Well, their next one be post.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.460]   New from Palm, post.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.780]   Post, yeah.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.740]   So I took the plunge and I got myself...
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:11.220]   I ordered two of those converter boxes from the government.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.500]   Did you get the $40 coupon?
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.820]   People need those.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:15.820]   Who needs those?
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.180]   I can't believe you took that out of the hands of the poor and infirm.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.180]   That is shameful.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:26.460]   Anyway, the one, by the way, I recommend to people out there is the Channel Master.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.460]   Yes.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.460]   CM7000.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:35.340]   The Channel Master 7000 as recommended by John C. Devorak.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.340]   And what does that...
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.260]   Good one because he took the last two.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.260]   The last two.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.820]   Apparently, there's a shortage.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:41.820]   There is a shortage.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.900]   Did you also get a coupon, John?
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.540]   No, I got two coupons.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.700]   Of course you did.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.700]   Oh, man.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.860]   You're even spending the money of these...
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.860]   Oh, man.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:50.860]   He's just going to lie.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.860]   I think that's really funny.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.500]   I think they're giving money away.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.740]   What am I supposed to do?
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.420]   I'm too rich for your money.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.580]   Give it to the bankers.
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:04.140]   You know, if you go down, there's free cheese in Portland.
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:05.100]   Government don't knock it.
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.100]   It's not bad.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.100]   Government cheese.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.100]   It's far to drive.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.100]   All right.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.100]   Cheese.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.100]   This comes in the mail.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.100]   So, do you...
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.100]   But I take it you actually had a need for this.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.620]   Yeah, I got a couple of monitors.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.580]   I could use a tuner.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.580]   I...
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:18.580]   I'm...
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.460]   I'm horrified.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:27.460]   Did you go to, you know, Pinnacle or Hapog and buy a, you know, a tuner and all that stuff?
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.460]   Right.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:32.140]   I did it online at SolidSignal because you can't get the channel master from anybody
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.180]   in a brick and mortar.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.820]   Now why do you recommend the channel master?
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.700]   Well, I looked at all the different reviews and all the different ones and this one seems
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.700]   to keep cropping up.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   It's got an S video.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.700]   Most of them don't have that.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.980]   It's got other features that are kind of cool.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:50.060]   And by the way, someone mentioned to me that the stimulus bill includes $640 million for
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.060]   these decoders.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.060]   That's right.
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.220]   They're trying to refund it.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.020]   That sounds like a lot, but you know, it's a big country.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.460]   There's a lot of people.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.460]   It's 5%.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.460]   Isn't it?
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.220]   It's something they think it's 5% of households.
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.220]   We'll need this.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.580]   Well, I think most people don't know that they need this.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.580]   That's what's going to happen.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.540]   It's they put it off, but come June 17th.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.540]   They're still not going to know.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.860]   They're still going to be flooded with calls saying, "What happened?"
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.180]   I thought I did have a digital TV.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.620]   It has a digital front piece of it.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:23.340]   It looks got a 12 colon 00 on there and that's digital.
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.700]   It's blinking 12 at me.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:26.700]   Those are digits.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:32.900]   Well, when that apocalyptic day comes, maybe John can donate his boxes to me.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.900]   John's got two.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:34.900]   I'm looking them up.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:35.900]   I got a...
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.900]   But that way, John, you need...
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.140]   I have an old TV in the kitchen that would use one of these.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.420]   You get cable right where you live.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.420]   I mean, you're not like...
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:42.620]   I used the dish network.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.620]   Okay.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.620]   So you don't need...
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.700]   Well, I actually have cable too.
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.500]   I have that cable hook to a swing box.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:53.220]   So you got cable and you got satellite and now you can receive through rabbit ears.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:59.740]   Actually, I've been receiving most of my HDTV programming already, not through rabbit ears,
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.740]   but with a UHF antenna.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.740]   That's true, actually.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.740]   That's the best deal.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:03.740]   It is.
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.540]   That's the best deal and high def.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.540]   It really looks good.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.540]   Mm-hmm.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.380]   That's what I have heard that.
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.380]   All right.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.740]   My child just woke up from his nap.
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.340]   Perfect, because I just ran out of stories.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.340]   Molly Wood is...
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:16.340]   Excellent.
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:21.140]   Molly Wood is online, ladies and gentlemen, at cnet.com/molly.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.140]   You're the best Molly.
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:22.980]   We miss you on Buzz.
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:24.620]   I'm glad you could be here on the Twitter.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.620]   I really appreciate it.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.620]   Oh, thank you.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:27.620]   I hope to do it.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.620]   We'll be on Buzz.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.620]   Loud tomorrow or Tuesday.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:30.620]   Oh, really?
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.620]   Actually, I'll be on that one too.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.620]   Okay.
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.100]   We'll be reunited in two short days.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.100]   Hooray.
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:37.100]   Yay.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.820]   John C. Devorak is at channeldevorak.com.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:41.820]   Thank you for having me with this.
