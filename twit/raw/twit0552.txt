[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.040]   like to ply them with liquor to loosen up the conversation Becky Worley is here
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.480]   she's the queen of liquor plan. Well I always bring you a bottle so I've brought
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   you a bottle of nice red wine I don't think we can add on to these beautiful
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.320]   old cations. I once told you and John de Vorak that I liked my wine that
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.960]   tasted like the bug spray off I finally realized it's minerality. Oh I actually
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.000]   like Leo I'm grown up now. Oh it's minerality aka bug spray. And one more bottle for you.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.080]   You did open that up so we'll have that later. Yes we will in honor of the salt like were you
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.280]   were you in Austin? I was not but I thought that we should commemorate it I
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.840]   have a whole case at home so I love the salt like barbecue in Austin as I know
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   everybody else does and South by is coming up. We'll talk about it. Thank you so much
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.280]   Becky Worley of course for maybe she's good morning America Yahoo news. Not anymore.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.000]   Yeah. You weren't were you laid off with the rest? No that was just sort of a long
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.560]   roll on a fade off. Yeah long fade but that's my third one so I'll be back.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.000]   Also with is Harry McCracken king of the long fade. Technology. No I had some mean
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.920]   thing to say. I don't even know what that means. I don't know what it means either.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.360]   It's probably a fast company. No you shouldn't be. That's a dumb thing to say.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.760]   It has nothing to do with you. It's actually Jason Snow. Thing of the long fade.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.120]   King of the long fade. I'm more of Prince of the long fade. Prince of the long fade.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.640]   So hi there from six colors.com. It's great. Three of my favorite people. This is
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.360]   going to be a lot of fun. I don't even know if there's news to talk about who
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   cares. Who cares. We've got old fashions. We're going to have some
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   last freedom. We're all starting sober. Thanks Anthony. Our brilliant editor who is
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.320]   apparently also a mixologist. Look at the Maraschino cherries with the
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.720]   with the orange twists kind of as an S curve throughout. I know it's beautiful.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.360]   That is good too. That's a nice bourbon. And I asked him what he's sweet. Yeah we
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.840]   have Woodford Reserve. I asked him what he's sweet. What do you say?
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.520]   Summ syrup. Summ syrup. Summ syrup. You have everything. Is that from me from
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:53.160]   sorghum? Yeah you squeeze it out of chewing gum. Anybody's king of the long
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.400]   fade it would be me. So don't take that personally. I am I am I am fading as we
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.720]   speak. We're all holding on. Sad note we'll start off with a sad note. The man
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.320]   who invented the at sign Ray Tomlinson passed this weekend. He was 74. He had a
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.400]   heart attack. He was way back at the days of the earliest days of the internet
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   at Bolt, Baranik and Newman. They were the. I haven't heard of that before.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.440]   Cambridge. Yeah they were the the consultant that Arpa went to to help
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.360]   them create this thing called the internet BBN. And he was there and you
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.080]   know that he created the he they were looking for a way to indicate email. And
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.000]   he suggested the at sign separating the username from the host name. You need to
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.640]   do that because you could have duplicate usernames and you could have
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.760]   duplicate host names but in theory you'd have a unique username at host name and
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.560]   the at sign is a perfect perfect beautiful way to do it. People who did not
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.080]   live life before the internet don't realize that it used to be you only saw
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.360]   the at sign on like apples at the supermarket like to you know surprise
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.320]   twelve at two dollars each or something like that. There's about the only place
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.360]   you ever saw it was a it was an archaic symbol that is now like super important
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.560]   to everything we do on the internet. It's really the only guy up there on the
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.680]   top row above your numbers that isn't used for anything but email. It was a
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.600]   perfect choice. Not dollar sign not percent. Well in fact I remember I'm
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.320]   trying to remember the law you you might remember better Harry but I remember
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.200]   there were others symbols proposed. There I don't know if it was a fight but it
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.080]   wasn't an automatic that the at sign would be selected now it seems like of
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.280]   course. So natural and it took a long time before we all knew about it of course
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.920]   because even though he invented in 1971 for the longest time if you were on
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.200]   America online you could only send email to other people on America online and
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.240]   there was no at sign and it wasn't yeah there was no need for it because you were
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.600]   on AOL so it wasn't until the early 90s that kind of normal consumers who are
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.400]   not academics are involved in the government got access to it. Yeah MCI
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.800]   mail you just had a number. CompuServe number. How long members
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.480]   are compressive number. 72075. Yeah I remember my password.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.880]   You know actually it had really good passwords because they had they had
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.440]   weird words separated by symbols and and that was actually it turns out that's
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.560]   a pretty good password my one password the password manager I use just added a
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.320]   feature where you can have a certain number of words in a chain separated by
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.920]   symbols I thought oh great compuServe passwords they're back. That's password
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.480]   padding basically. But Steve Gibson's calls the idea of bringing that symbol
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   in. Exactly and and they're more memorable that way and that's why I can
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.680]   remember my compuServe password from 1983 or whatever. That's interesting.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:59.600]   The ad sign. Yeah no. Somebody's got a data. Carbon data. The ad sign is called the
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.880]   Appenstacha in Dutch for Monkeys Tale in Danish it's the elephant's trunk or
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:13.560]   snobble in Finnish it's the Kissant or cats tale German klamarafa or hanging
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.480]   monkey. When was it invented? Well there's actually some debate over it.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:26.400]   Some think it's a symbol for the amphora which was a unit of measurement the
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.040]   terracotta jars that they were used in the Greek times. They can trace it back to
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.760]   the 16th century a Florentine trader who used the at sign in his books. Others say
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   the monks did it because they were lazy and they were trying to reduce the
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.800]   number of strokes so instead of writing out AT they would write A and with a
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.760]   little curly Q. So history doesn't tell us where it began. Well it's
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.880]   serendipitous because it has the right meaning at you know user at host but also
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.080]   that it wasn't used or that it wasn't in time. It was no competition yeah and
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.160]   it's quite a was it always up there. I think it was always on like I remember
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.720]   it on my typewriter keyboards. I told my dad he was Smith Corona. He worked at
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.040]   the time. That's right he's from Smith Corona. He just used one. He was one. It
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.120]   gives you hope that the tilde or the carat may someday become useful. Right.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.080]   I'm trying to find I can't the history of using the at sign email. I remember
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.920]   there were some issues. I feel like it had a use in you. There were some lesser
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   uses in Unix or something as a oh I know maybe it was APL or one of those weird
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.960]   programming languages adopted it too. Because you know in the early days of
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.840]   the computer they were just looking at the keyboard like we need more symbols
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.120]   right let's use what can we use this for. I remember learning basic and how the
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.920]   dollar sign to me came to represent string variables because Apple soft
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.840]   basic it was you know set name string to whatever and the string was the dollar
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.880]   sign so it'll always be that for me. Every symbol possible that could be used
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.560]   for a programming language or anything like that was used in the 70s. Like every
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.320]   part of the Buffalo you know yeah like every part of the keyboard was used by
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.280]   those systems. Everything but the squeal. Ray also helped
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.400]   standardize the from field the subject field. You had to have a two field. You
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.640]   had an email. You basically made me. So next time you use email tip in old
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.840]   fashioned to Ray Tomlinson the godfather of email passed away at the age of
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:39.960]   74. I found a strange segue from the story of his of his passing to the big
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.520]   story that's been the story of the year so far which is Apple versus the FBI
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.560]   which is I think what a lot of people came to this week is that this is gonna
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.040]   mandate a certain level of government development to come up with their own
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.760]   technological solutions and that's gonna be an infrastructure and there's
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.040]   there's just gonna be huge cost associated with getting the government up to speed
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   and it made me think of the investment that the government made in ARPANET and
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.320]   DARPANET and that we haven't seen anything of that scale since. You really
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.520]   think that that's what is called for is kind of a moonshot to solve this problem.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.640]   Let's just put it this way I just backed us into it let's start at the
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.360]   beginning and see if we can get there. That was my that was all right. I saw the
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.240]   big picture in it and then I realized let's let's do the news and let's get
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.440]   there because I think that's the opinion that's got to come out of this. We don't
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.920]   need to of course go back through the whole taudrey story we will finally hear
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.760]   the court's decision on the 22nd which is two weeks from Tuesday and but it
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.320]   won't be the end of it because whichever way it goes in in the department
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.640]   Justice's favor or Apple's favor there will be an appeal no doubt it'll end up
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.760]   with the Supreme Court if they choose to take the case and it goes to the Ninth
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.000]   Circuit first right yeah it's got a ways to go it's only with a magistrate
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.200]   right now but I think this is the question that I would say is the real
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:10.120]   question should there be in our lives somewhere so private that only we can
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:16.440]   look at it do we as people deserved it and focusing on the smartphone maybe is
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   kind of misleading should we as people have somewhere we can put stuff that
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.920]   nobody including law enforcement can look at we have that that's called our
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.880]   brains yeah it already exists is a space that's protected but it holds so little
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.480]   when my case and it and it's and it's unfortunately flawed in its ability to
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   recollect perfectly right a smart a smartphone is an extension to your
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.200]   brain if this were an extension of the brain do you think it deserves that kind
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:48.720]   of protection Chris Vance who spoke at the congressional hearings on behalf of
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.520]   all the state and local DA as he said that hundreds of years of jurisprudence
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:13:03.720]   have given us this the the view that no vessel no safe no home is exempt from a
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.960]   warrant except your brain except your brain so that's an interesting question
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.200]   so nobody's proposing I hope they don't you know what they're not proposing it
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.280]   because they don't have the technology let's let's go forward at time 20 years
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.440]   when the technology exists to read your mind and law enforcement says then well
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.720]   there's stuff in there if we could read your mind we know if you were guilty or
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.600]   not oh J if we could read OJ's mind we wouldn't have to have a trial we just
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:35.080]   find out and and then they say to whoever is the apple of of the 22nd century
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.400]   can you get us in there why is that any different from a polygraph should they
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.640]   be allowed to do that but polygraph's not a missable in court to this day because
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.680]   it's imperfect it's imperfect let's say you could do a perfect mind read and we're
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:59.520]   to we're talking to the the Supreme Court of 2050 I'd say no I think that
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.960]   that's that's a self-intrimination isn't it that's what the that's what the
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.640]   Fifth Amendment protects you against right so okay so is so I think that was a
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.840]   good point to make Harry because if this is an extension of the brain if a
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.320]   smartphone is an extension of the brain should it have those protections
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.440]   you should it be private or not well arguing against me on case I mean pen and
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.960]   paper have always been extensions of the brain - it's just that it's way harder to
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.400]   lock up pen and paper than it is yeah we're here because technology has given us
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.560]   a way to take the part of our brain put it somewhere and have it be invisible
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.520]   technology is almost but not quite there it isn't by the way and that's another
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.320]   story here which is that the FBI if they wanted to probably could hack that 5c
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.560]   Jonathan Zadarski who is probably there's probably no one more expert on iOS
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   forensics is of the opinion yeah you know what there's ways if they really
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.680]   want to they don't want to they want to establish a precedent so let's not
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.440]   talk about that 5c that's not the important point the important point is
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.440]   do we deserve do we need something except for our brain besides our brain that we
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.280]   can keep to ourselves private including keep it away from law enforcement and
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.080]   you're right historically law enforcement with appropriate court
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:20.400]   authority has had access to everything but our brain is that right accurate and
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.960]   our spouses like you can't I mean in terms of the self-incrimination
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.760]   yeah it's a it's a really novel argument to suggest and I wonder if
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.240]   somebody will argue this at some point that this is part of the right to not
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.480]   self-incriminate and that the smartphone is an extension of my brain it's it's a
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.400]   it's I love that argument to I'm not sure that it would actually ever work but I
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:51.200]   like the idea because how my wife's iPhone broke yesterday and she was she
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.000]   drove somewhere today to pick up my my son and she said you know I'm out there
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.640]   and thinking I'm an adult I can do this without without a phone but we have
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.560]   offloaded so much of this work to our phones and and so I think that's an
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.040]   interesting argument it seems unlikely to me that anybody's ever gonna go for
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.080]   it but I like I agree with you Harry for raising it's more of an ethical argument
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.960]   than a legal one it is we're not talking law here and of course that's why the
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.520]   law makes interesting provisions like the wife if you're just my girlfriend you
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.600]   can incriminate me but if you're my wife you can't that's just the law saying
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.040]   kind of carving out where those lines are in self-incrimination but at the very
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.120]   we're not talking about law we're talking about ethics we're talking about
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.280]   principle well and the existence of a safe space the very the very existence of
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.920]   what what somebody called a warrant proof place where there was there was a
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.280]   piece linked to John Gruber linked to it from during fireball about this matter
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.360]   and and somebody said do we really think we want to have a place that's warrant
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.240]   proof and the answer is that place exists already is in our minds it's not a
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.920]   novel concept not everywhere is reachable or should it be reachable by law
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.840]   enforcement it's like Steve Jobs said the computer is a bicycle for the mind and
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.800]   that's even more true of smartphones than ever was of PCs I think this is much
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.080]   more interesting conversation than the the nitty gritty of the decryption that
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.000]   we've been going through for the last few weeks and it's not obvious I don't
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.920]   think you know you you can if you're a technologist people yell at me for saying
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.680]   well there's more to this than just yes we should have encryption there's lots to
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.280]   talk about people get mad at me for not just you know defending the right to
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.000]   encryption because I but I do think it's a larger discussion and when you kind of
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.520]   eliminated from this kind of technical discussion but say do is there somewhere
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.640]   else besides your brain that should be private that's a tougher question to
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.240]   answer it just to play devil's advocate on this though it's much more than a
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:48.920]   receptacle it's a transmission device right it's a knowledge center so I think
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.240]   it's much more complicated than that if you said I have my personal hard drive
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.520]   that is the extension of my memory and that is a separate being it's like you
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.240]   know there's a lot about separation in that that may have that may play into
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.760]   that metaphor although I mean our our knowledge base and our brain but if we
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.160]   say something it's a messible right and that's our transmission device I could
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.480]   make that argument right but they can't force you to give up your password but
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.640]   they can force you to give up a hair for a DNA sapper or fingerprint to unlock
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.400]   your phone yeah I think you could make a pretty strong case that this is separate
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.280]   this is distinct from your brain this is your phone it's not your brain the
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.040]   fact that you willingly put all your brain stuff in there doesn't somehow give
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.520]   it some special protection it's your own choice you chose to do that I would
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.440]   argue that for purposes of law enforcement this shouldn't the smartphone
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.160]   should not be somehow specially protected okay so then what I think
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.960]   your brain should be protected I don't in this 2050 scenario hypothetical I
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.200]   think I would be horrified if they said oh no they can read your mind and find
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.640]   out if you're guilty that would be horrific I think we'll probably come to
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.720]   that day sometime can they compel you to take an x-ray or do anything like that
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   so yeah it's not deemed that your body can incriminate you so giving your
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.600]   fingerprint or a DNA sample or an x-ray is not considered currently by our
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.520]   courts as self-incrimination that's test the testimony of your thumb and that's
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.320]   a admissible oddly enough but that's all artificial we've carved these rules
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.400]   fortunately encrypting things that the government can't get to is not illegal
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.600]   at this point the the issue is the government wants the manufacturers of
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.040]   systems that use encryption to have a ways to get in so that it's not just
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.560]   between you and your device but that there's a third party involved which is
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.760]   the manufacturer or the government and that's practically making it illegal to
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.000]   have encryption from a practical point of view well I mean I think what would
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.360]   happen if they made it illegal for apple to make an encrypted iPhone that apple
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.160]   couldn't break into at the behest of the government would be that all the people
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.960]   who do have something that they're plotting like terrorists and other
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.760]   criminals would switch to third party software that could be compiled using
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.600]   known encryption and would be encrypted in a way that apple couldn't get at I
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.240]   mean it would they would just move the game somewhere else it would be
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.000]   everybody else that's left with the third party broken encryption criminal
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.960]   then only criminals will have his kind of what Tim Cook was saying in his
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.360]   interview with ABC is is I'm not trying to protect the terrorist bad guys will
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.920]   always have ways to do this effectively I'm trying to protect the average person
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.080]   apples jobs to protect the to give to put these tools in the hands of normal
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.000]   people who aren't sophisticated technically and it's pretty remarkable
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.120]   that the bad guys have not all switched to the most bulletproof possible they're
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.680]   not right that's why they're bad guys really organized enough that's one of
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.640]   the things law enforcement always tells me is you know I say well what if somebody
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.440]   has strong encryption in a password they say you know what most of the time they
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.520]   just tell us their password for the for the most part the what law
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.440]   enforcement deals with is not such bright crooks and if somebody is very
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.160]   sophisticated and unfortunately that tends to be terrorists you know the
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.760]   ISIS types if they're that sophisticated it's pretty hard to deal took us how
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.440]   long to get Osama bin Laden because he was smart enough to cut himself off
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.080]   from the internet well we deal with a courier and because we made it public
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.680]   that they were tracking him with his satellite phone and so we went dark on
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.640]   satellite right which again has a parallel here which is if we say Apple
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.400]   has the you know backdoor key I said I wasn't gonna say backdoor did it if
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:39.560]   Apple has this key then that tells terrorists or organized criminals to go
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.120]   use different platforms GPG yeah I have a question I didn't know if you guys
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.400]   could answer this so I thought it was really interesting this week the
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.320]   conversation about that Apple does have the ability to absolutely provide single
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:22:00.000]   access to individual devices with keys that are individual to the devices
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.920]   themselves this was Steve Gibson's whole thing about the individual numbers
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.520]   generated by the phone his point was that if Apple made a revised firmware it
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   would be signed for that one phone in that one phone only right that the
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.920]   signing that Apple does with firmware in tangles I think that's the term Apple
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:25.280]   uses their key their their special crypto key with a unique identifier of
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.440]   the phone so that that firmware is unique to that phone right and so his position
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.880]   was Apple could make a modified firmware that would only be usable on that 5c
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.920]   and that's burned into the boot ROM right yeah so my question is is that in the
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.120]   OS or in the hardware manufacturers in the secure-on cloud so that's hardware
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.680]   so that means that if the phones are made by Huawei or made by HTC that if we
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.360]   extend this beyond Apple that it's the hardware makers that have to do this
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.800]   right in fact it was Jonathan Zadarski's point that one way to do this would be
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.080]   actually physically copy the contents of the chip on the phone from one I'm not
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.040]   sure exactly I mean he's smarter than I am but I'm not sure exactly how he's
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.520]   proposing to do this but that was take that take that you mean to create a mirror
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.120]   of the of the hard drive he said and just keep replicating it as you try and
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.440]   crack it yes okay yeah yeah in other words exactly right you could continue to
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.200]   try it wouldn't worry if it erased itself after ten tries because you have a copy
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:36.520]   of it right it's still encrypted the bad my question about the other thing is by
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.920]   the way let's point out your iCloud is not safe because Apple has the keys
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.440]   period yes and Apple's already a third party in the middle Apple's point was if
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.520]   they had just let the thing back up we kind of give you the information in
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.480]   fact I think that's gonna be Apple's strongest defense in the end is that the
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.160]   FBI screwed up it seemed to be in the testimony in Congress the Congress was
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.760]   upset the FBI screwed up well as the FBI thought it was not some tough
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.440]   questions from Daralissa and others but the but Congress seemed upset that way
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.240]   wait a minute you're saying you're putting this this burden on Apple because
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.680]   you didn't do the right thing well that kind of let's Apple off the hook it
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.040]   unfortunately also kicks the can down the road of this issue yeah should there
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.560]   be you know their perfect test case has been corrupted there is this all
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.320]   fascinating question of the government telling companies that have done
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.000]   nothing wrong here you need to create this solution for us whether that is
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.440]   legal right there's the argument that Apple if this became standard procedure
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.360]   then every law enforcement group around the world would be going to Apple and
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:46.720]   asking for Apple engineers to write software to access Apple hardware and at
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.680]   what point do you not to make a slippery slope argument but how many employees
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.760]   does Apple need to pay to do the work of law enforcement in order to be in
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.800]   business selling what happens when China gets upset over something I agree
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.840]   speech well the apples apples right to say this is a bad idea from a purely
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.640]   business point of view okay so let's go back to my original premise that this
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.360]   is the moonshot so Susan Landau who testified before Congress she said the
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.760]   biggest problem with asking Apple to create their own internal compliance to
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.800]   unlock the thousands of phones that are in the judicial backlog is that anyone
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:29.040]   who's involved in compliance be it ADA compliance tax compliance they know that
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.880]   this becomes the smallest priority in the company's budgeting it's something
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.280]   they have to do it has no benefit to the company it's just a compulsion therefore
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.200]   you get low-level employees they start and they're more likely to give you up
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.760]   it's the easiest one for organized crime or state sponsored terrorists or for
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.840]   corporate espionage to get in there and get that key what's the moonshot saying
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.160]   government should do this her point is that this is a cat and mouse game and
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.080]   that the government has not kept up with the ability to be able to decrypt
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.000]   these phones on their own and that they're outsourcing of this and compulsion of
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:17.160]   an apple ultimately a Samsung etc etc is a deficiency in their own yeah what I
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.400]   think she's mistaken what it sounds like she's saying is well we should just
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.440]   have we should build some giant quantum computers so that we can break encryption
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.280]   or hire a bunch of hackers to build zero-day exploits that only the you know
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.880]   that we've done that we know we've done that well sure I've snowed and told us
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.120]   and I certainly have I think the I think it's a it's a foolish idea to think that
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.200]   you can defeat the math the math is strong and it's it was be a mistake for
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.560]   the government to say well we're just gonna build faster computers because we
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   just make longer keys it's not that's not a hard thing to beat and so that's
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.120]   not the way to go after okay we'll combine that with Jonathan Zardowski's
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.520]   theory that you could then mirror the image you have to take advantage of flaws
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.480]   right the reason the mirror imaging works is because there is a flawed front door
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.120]   which is this four or six digit code that's a that's just a bad passcode that's
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.280]   all it's not a if you had a strong password wouldn't matter
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.680]   encryption encryption the math is sound and that's that's what's really
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.160]   challenging for this because I don't think there's anything the government can
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:24.280]   do unless it says it mandates that encryption not be allowed it has to it
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.560]   has to do fundamentally what you just said Jason's now which is making
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.600]   encryption illegal and that's and that's not gonna work because
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.960]   encryption's a math right it's like making math illegal we can't make math
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:39.880]   illegal you can't so you just make American encryption bad big how how
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.360]   effective is that I feel like I'm playing devil's advocate or at least
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.320]   what I'm interested in because it's become such an echo chamber I think in
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.840]   the tech community of saying like well encryption has to be legal we have to
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.800]   continue this so I've been trying to listen this week to all the different
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   sides of it and one of them that I found interesting was General Keith
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.360]   Anderson he was the former NSA director he was on Bloomberg and his point was a
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   look for the technical solution I think we've discussed that but he said the
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.040]   other option would be to look for a third party solution I think it's a little
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.080]   out there but I'm just posing it because I'd like to hear you know what they
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.120]   don't want to say the true thing which is you need to make encryption illegal
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.440]   the government tried to do this before with very negative effects when they
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:30.720]   said we cannot export strong encryption as a result we used 40 bit keys which
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.840]   was weak and that was allowed to export and no browser company was going to make
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.760]   a separate version of the browser for us and then the rest of the world so we
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.840]   had 40 bit keys in our browsers and to this day it continues to bite us because
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.800]   we still support this weak encryption technology in our browsers and we're
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.760]   trying to we're still trying to get this stuff out of there because it's such an
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.960]   easy target that was a exact perfect example of the unintended negative
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.720]   consequence of making weak encryption you just can't do it effectively and so
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.560]   if the question is and I think we've come to that point conclusion the question
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.240]   is should encryption be illegal there's no question the answer is there's nothing
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.120]   you can do about it I think make it illegal but unilateral I think you're
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   on to something though this idea of an almost like an arms race more than a
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:26.440]   moonshot that that seems to be where this has to go is encryption will improve
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.680]   and people's counter encryption efforts will improve there's theoretically
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:35.480]   quantum computers will at some point be able to decrypt things at a much higher
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.280]   rate there are going to be security flaws that can be exploited but we may all as
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.720]   a society and in this may take 20 years for us to go through all this turmoil as
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.400]   a society we may all finally have to just admit that technology is going to
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.480]   create a brand new unreadable space it has that is that is it and yeah we're
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.520]   already there but we'll have to come to grips with that that it's like inside of
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.560]   your mind true encryption is like that you can't court order it open because
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.000]   there's no magic key to unlock the door submit the intel the smartest
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.960]   intelligence agencies in the United States and law enforcement office in
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.680]   the United States know that that's why they said well don't worry about it
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.880]   because we're gonna have the Internet of things we're gonna have lots of ways
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.400]   to spy on you yes there's gonna be strong encryption you can't stop that
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.640]   and you shouldn't stop that because it would weaken us as a country it would
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.880]   weaken our safety but don't worry we's plenty of ways we can spy on you there's
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.760]   always gonna be zero days and that's enough and I think I think the most
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.520]   sophisticated law enforcement people are saying that Harry don't do you think
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.440]   it's this binary well and no it's hugely complicated and I think the other
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.720]   question is if Apple was able to build a magic backdoor that only the
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.600]   government could get into only under the progress proper circumstances and
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   there was no way that anybody could leverage that to get in other than the
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.360]   government under proper circumstances would we then be okay with that because
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.640]   Apple's argument a big part of it is if we do if we do create some kind of
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:07.000]   backdoor then the code will get out there the bad guys can use it I think
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.160]   it's really dangerous a backdoor isn't gonna work you either say you either
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.960]   unilaterally make encryption illegal which we know is a bad idea or you just
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.120]   live with it and I think everybody's gonna come around to live with it because
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   you have no choice but then game it out okay so then encryption stays legal
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.080]   you can't compel the you can't compel the either can you nor should you right
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.200]   well it doesn't even matter if you can because as you said it's a hardware issue
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.400]   so let's say this is how you compel Apple to do it well good luck compelling
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.640]   Huawei to do it right so if you game this out at the end of the day that leaves
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:51.440]   the federal government with no choice other than to really find their own way
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.280]   into another way and that's where I think it is an arms race and I think it is a
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.360]   moon shot in terms of they have to build out their infrastructure well that
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.920]   arms race is gonna continue the zero-day exploits the finding new ways to spy on
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.720]   you that's gonna continue and maybe that's the moon shot I hate to think of that
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.800]   as a moonshot that's such a negative moonshot I don't want to see our
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:16.760]   government invest billions of dollars into you know freaking through walls so
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.840]   they can read what you're typing I think it's more algorithmic than that
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.040]   Vanneck freaking I've heard that phrase no longer
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.680]   I had to me a while to dredge it up from the memory well they're sort of used to
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.360]   being able to go to AT&T and just give us a room an AT&T
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.760]   well Kalea made that possible but but encryption makes it you can make Kalea
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.720]   three Kalea two you can make as make clear as you want encryption the math
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.160]   wins in the end and it's done that think that's really the bottom line and what
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.560]   you'll have is a lot of vestigial kind of well we got to find a way to have a
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.440]   back door you have a lot of that noise going on doesn't matter the math one it's
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:58.680]   too late don't you think it's too late there will be solutions that come through
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.880]   other channels whether they're legislative judicial they'll put cameras in every
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.680]   room doesn't you know actually we'll put cameras in wait a minute I did put a
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.720]   camera in every room yeah most of the data on your phone comes in and out over
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.000]   in at work which is a whole different yeah by the way no but I keep waving my
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.240]   phone around no one's commented on how beautiful this my phone is is a mirror
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.760]   it's not a mirror you know it's so funny it is it is a mirror finish this is the
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.360]   Samsung Galaxy S7 it's a mirror finish but go ahead and try to use it as a mirror
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.920]   I can't tell if I've got they've done something they've done something magical
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   to keep it from being a mirror huh why would they do that I think people they
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.280]   must have heard that people good like move their phone around and go ah that's me
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.240]   you can't it doesn't reflect it but doesn't reflect you like it oh I love
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:55.840]   this one because it looks doesn't it look like a brick of solid gold hmm
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.600]   this actually is a wonderful fun this is the always on feature which I really
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.800]   like you always see the time and you know you can put different things up there
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.920]   but it always shows the time they say it only depletes the battery point eight
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:13.480]   percent an hour this is the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and yeah even an eye
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.920]   always on always on is a good feature even an iPhone guys got to look at that
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.800]   and say boy that's that's a you don't have to get gold they have black the
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.080]   hardware the hardware is nice but that always on each of your eyes I want that
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.400]   I want that now camera is amazing and I don't think apple can do that because
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.760]   I think you need an OLED screen they always know let's go to get who owns
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.040]   the screens Samsung makes all these screens this is the screen is mind-boggling
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.800]   and it has Samsung pay it sounds like somebody said and it has Samsung pay
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.440]   was I hallucinating it does and that makes it better than an iPhone that
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.360]   makes it better than a Samsung pay means you can tap to pay at a swipe only
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.040]   register which of which there are still many and it works much of the time and
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.560]   all the time and anything that works much of the time but not all the time
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.920]   is tricky especially with payments if there are people standing behind you
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.440]   have you guys noticed that the all of the chip
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.800]   readers that are underneath the traditional swipers now have tape over
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.280]   them yeah they say don't don't insert something like 17 percent of our
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.960]   chance are are you actually who have the technology aren't using the chip is
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   that because the pin takes the chip takes so long I don't know because you can't
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.840]   take you can't just put it you can't you don't swipe it you leave it in it could
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.800]   also be that they've they've got the hardware but their service provider
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.240]   hasn't turned on the feature yet so it's still waiting although I've been to
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.360]   places that have it now and it's really infuriating because if you've ever
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.840]   traveled chip and pin is really convenient right this chip and sign it's like why
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.120]   am I sticking my card in if I still have to sign a receipt I think it's dying
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.800]   because I see places I when I started there and I could do the chip now they've
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.640]   got the tape over it yeah so I think that the adoption has just gone in the
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.680]   tanks if if you're running a market and you've got a limited number of
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.920]   checkers and you know that the chip thing slows you down by 30 seconds or
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.640]   a minute you could do the calculation at Trader Joe's or something and say you
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.840]   know what because because what they what they trade off is on fraud they
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.720]   have to they have to own the fraud if they do a swipe instead of the chip
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.240]   that's the reason and so they you could totally make that calculation and say
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.960]   it's not worth it to have our lines be that long in the store people are kind
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.640]   of not come in they're not going to shop we'll just eat the fraud and
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.000]   and just deal with it and people swipe their card I think you're right
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.600]   and the irony is chip and sign is certainly no more secure than swipe
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   and no chip and pin would be great even chip and pin well it's better it's
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.760]   better than crack anything involving signing yeah a piece of paper
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.200]   I know with whatever just draw it by the way they don't it doesn't matter what
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.560]   you saw yeah yeah the US is such a backwater just in general when it comes to
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.920]   payment technology it's really pretty embarrassing it's often the case that
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.040]   the people who invented the technology are the ones farthest behind because
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:50.120]   they have legacy systems they have infrastructure where big country they
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.080]   don't want to start over we're big country they want to start over my
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.840]   great hope for the apple watch was that it would be great for payment
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.480]   I use don't I use it everywhere there's apple pay I
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:07.320]   pay with my app watch I love it it is the best but it's only like Whole Foods
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.680]   and Trader Joe's and a couple other places and not like my local Safeway or
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.960]   anything like that ball grains yeah there's there's a handful and I love it
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.560]   when I get them but because that's that feels like the future is the
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.280]   contactless pay but it's still it's still not there
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.840]   fortunately a lot of these devices that do chip also do contactless and
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.640]   eventually they're all going to support all the payment methods right and we'll
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.360]   just pay with our phones or our watches and we'll be done but we're not there
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.000]   yet let's take a break what a panel what a

[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.600]   the funny thing is that you know we're gonna be moving probably in the
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.440]   summer I think and I think we're gonna have to throw out a lot of stuff
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.840]   no don't know give it to the computer museum just moved in here
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.560]   feels like that we've been here almost it'll be five plus years
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.440]   and they sold the place for a brewery they're gonna put they're gonna
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.120]   where we're sitting right now will be a giant vat of hops
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.600]   we're sitting the stage now I've noticed that twitter is more excited about
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.080]   posting pictures of our drinks than retweeting our deep thoughts
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.600]   okay all right do you know where you're moving up
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.080]   yeah we do I think we we haven't I think we've almost signed the I don't know
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.960]   it's close I saw something on the internet that said
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.320]   East Petaluma was very exciting it's not well that was early on this was
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.600]   the northeast it's not far from here it's too much
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.960]   from here it's nearby and it's going to be very much the same because
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.880]   we're just going to take this all and it's going to be a different shape box
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.240]   so we have to kind of mmm muddle it around a little bit but
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.160]   basically it's going to be here but what we don't have room for
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.640]   is the basement crap mmm all and we have so much of a yard sale or something
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   and I'll come and buy here why don't you just take it
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.600]   I'll give it a right I'll have a fundraiser I'm gonna pick up
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.400]   a truck you have somewhere to put it all right
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.360]   why is Marisa going to kill me if it is are you gonna kill me I think she is
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.680]   you should have a fundraiser we can have a live auction
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.840]   a really that would be no one who wants a twit sidewalk sale
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.200]   nobody wants a non-functioning Osborne computer oh you
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.880]   guarantee people will travel here for the non-functioning Osborne computer
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.560]   some of its functioning I think the amiga works I gave away a be box when I left
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.920]   Mac user to go to Mac world and I regretted to this day because I could
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.200]   have had a be box occasionally buy back things I own and got rid of
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:13.240]   is that funny 30 years ago how much for this fine visor palm computer
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.600]   now it comes with the how about this it comes with those modules where they
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.720]   call that you plug them in you would know that it's
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.320]   anyway our show today brought to you by fresh books we find it's easier to make
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.040]   money by doing advertising and selling a roll gear
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.120]   freshbooks calm actually this was the only way I could make money when I was a
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.240]   freelancer you have to send out the invoices to get paid I learned that
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.880]   lesson boy did I learn that lesson I hate doing invoices firing up word
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.080]   next selling get all the receipts together for your expenses and
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.440]   it was I just would put it off and put it off and then six months later I go oh I
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.760]   better get I haven't received a check that's because you haven't sent an
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.000]   invoice Leo and then you send him six invoices and they were not happy about
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.120]   that fortunately amber MacArthur I was whining about this
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.480]   on the set and amber said well why don't you try fresh books it was it just
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.760]   started in the Toronto was early 2000s and it was so great because all of a
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.800]   sudden I'm making my invoices online I'm emailing them out they can pay
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.320]   faster because on every invoice there's a pay me button and they can use any
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.960]   online service you know online payment service to pay you
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.720]   and it's so much easier to keep track when come tax time you've got it all the
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.280]   it's basically cloud accounting software and when you when you you'll just
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.520]   be so happy next tax time because all your cash flows in one place you know
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.680]   exactly what invoices were sent who paid you who didn't pay you and by the
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.120]   way they automatically you'll ding them and say hey you haven't paid in a nice
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.240]   way but they'll get you paid and you'll know exactly where your
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.520]   income stands you could take pictures of your receipts
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.480]   not only for expense purposes but if if you if you declare them as deductions
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.400]   makes it a breeze at tax time the fresh books apple do that
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.360]   you can even set up fresh books to import expenses directly from your bank
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.560]   account best part about fresh books is that
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.120]   huh feeling you get when tax time comes around and you got it you got I got
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.840]   this you'll be ready because you're going to sign up right now

[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.000]   what is that a mr peanut made of soda cans
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.560]   oh it's um it's food cans it's a grocery store
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.440]   there's this event called can't structure which i think happens all around the
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.640]   world and people like architects build stuff and build
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.000]   and builders build giant things out of donated food cans
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.520]   and when they're done showing them off they give all of the food to
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.720]   charity oh or they could send me the cans i'll put it in the basement
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.280]   but there's all kinds of stuff it was at Rincon Center in San Francisco
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.040]   it's closed unfortunately but well but harry's got pictures on the
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.400]   technologizer blog look at that there's prints made out of
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.640]   Campbell's soup france serif the franklin uh
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.160]   michael jackson people are creative there's a giant duck
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:14.760]   giant cover gucky giant tractor rosy the rivader who is really hard to do
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.280]   with cans uh-huh uh-huh it's kind of cool because you're
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.520]   basically dealing with pixels but there are these really large
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.360]   they're giant pixels yeah uh you probably you probably would not be
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.400]   able to tell us rosy the rivader unless you knew because you can't really do
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.720]   it squint in order to do her face with any details
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.920]   or face would have to be like a bag
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.240]   harry you see the world through different different view
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.680]   through canned colored glasses what do you what camera are using this looks
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.640]   like this shot it's beautiful are you not using a camera phone
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.720]   ah i did some of those with a phone you mentioned uh
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.080]   about ten minutes ago and we're praising you are you on nda on this phone
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.040]   you can't even say i can you so something weird happened with this
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.800]   galaxy s7 i bought it from t-mobile i didn't get it from
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   pr there are journalists maybe somebody in this room
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.400]   who have this but can't talk about it because there's still embargoed
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.120]   i had if i had one i don't think i would be allowed to express to me opinions
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.960]   about it
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.280]   rosy like but t-mobile sent this to me monday because i bought it
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.320]   i don't think that usually happens that's unusual that would happen sometimes
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.000]   at mac world where we would be waiting for things from apple and we would
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.600]   and we would buy them and that was it was easier to just get them
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.160]   by buying them when would if you were if you just i know i can i phrases
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.640]   this is talking about a hypothetical march 11th
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.400]   okay that's all march 11th march 11th that's when
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.680]   did they send it to you because you're you or were there other no i went
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.440]   online the day the pre-orders began i sent 700
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.480]   some bucks and uh i was shocked when t-mobile sent me an email saying
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.520]   uh your phone's gonna run monday but no they didn't wasn't because of me it was
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.920]   just i'm a customer i get a free vr visor too and a year worth of netflix so
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.240]   there you know what i would just like to say that
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.240]   rubio and trump ain't got nothing on me because when i see these big phones it
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.680]   reminds me all i can think is baby hands because
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.200]   all i see do this make me does this make this is my
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.400]   this is for make my hand looks small that is it
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.600]   that is an interesting question i just got to say
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.760]   uh there's absolutely no problem here
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.120]   down here it's huge that's not a very large phone
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.160]   biked to this action what's funny is five and a half inches but because there's
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.080]   no bezel on it that feels smaller than the
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.480]   iPhone 6s i have to say the wraparound edges are
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.360]   pretty cool it's not i'll tell you the negative is you
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.960]   keep your fingers are on the edges there's so little bezel and so little
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.800]   you know side that you have to hold it like you have
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.720]   tiny hands is it touch sensitive on the side yeah this is the screen the screen
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.680]   wraps around so you accidentally launching things all the time
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:55.880]   oh and unfortunately because it's so fast they launch fast
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.320]   it's kind of it feels like the not only is the phone slipper but the user
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.240]   interface is slippery it's like things happen that you didn't really plan
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   on the other hand i it's so beautiful you could get this the the s7 without the
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.440]   edge but i just like i was here eight days ago yeah
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.840]   for the screen savers and you said you know what i i think i might get that
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.480]   galaxy s7 i thought that and everybody laughed in the studio because you're
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.400]   like yeah we already figured that one out Leo because it's new but you did it
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.720]   and here it is it's amazing just like that and then
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.360]   and i'm two days later you had it two weeks from now there'll be a new
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.560]   iPhone and i'll probably get that too what's it what are you here
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.360]   well the rumor is that it's going to be this special edition it's basically
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.200]   an update of the size we are familiar with from the iPhone 5 line but with the
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.080]   four inches right yeah so it's a small phone and you know what there are
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.040]   people out there who want a small phone because it makes your hands look big
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.480]   yeah or they have small hands and it makes their their hands look normal
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.880]   size i don't know but it's so depressing that the political
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.880]   that the thing there's so many important things to talk about
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.640]   anyway gone i actually think phones have gotten too thin and too big
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.440]   like because i can't for maybe i have baby hands but that's like i'm
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.040]   constantly that one's a little thicker than the last model which is nice i
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.920]   wish i that's the first time i said that is
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:15.080]   but i i actually find that the iPhone 6 that i have
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.760]   it's easier to handle with a case on yes well i did order a case for that
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.920]   my iPhone 6 it's the first iPhone i've ever used with a case i was in no case
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.080]   kind of person and it's too slippery it's like a
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.840]   little polished pebble and i would i would like phones that are
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.440]   more grippy and i would trade a little bit of uh
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.400]   of weight and thickness for more battery life too
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.320]   and uh but this is so i think a variety is a good thing and i think that's the
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.880]   nice thing about apples this rumor about this
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:47.080]   i-phone s-c or whatever is that is that it's not small phones or old phones
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.280]   with this it'll be like you can get a good modern iPhone with touch id and
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.600]   with a with the iPhone 6 internals in a smaller size if you want it and i
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.040]   think that's great you know it's funny is that
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:04.600]   by all accounts the next iPhone 7 will be even thinner than the rumor at i-phone
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.840]   that they are continuing this bizarre process of making it
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.880]   thinner still and that's why they're and that this one i think is going to be
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.840]   controversial i think it's johnny i've right it's the
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.200]   he he wants to say every year this is the thinnest
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.920]   phone we've ever made he wants to say that
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:25.160]   and uh in order to do that though he's going to have to remove the
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.400]   the earplugs that's that's the thing is that's not accurate the reality is
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   there are lots of incredibly thin devices including apples own ipod touch
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.840]   that are much thinner than his ive and still has a standard headphone jack so
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.960]   they may use that as an excuse but if they get rid of the headphone jack it's
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.600]   not because of the question that's why that seems like
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:48.120]   that uh you know sophisticated users will probably say well that's fine
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.080]   because i can i don't know what i'll figure out a thing to do with the
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.400]   lightning port but i think most users are going to go
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.800]   you got rid of the what well i think there is a huge percentage of iphone
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.640]   users who just use the standard earbuds that come in the box of course and those
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.280]   will there will be a lightning version if they do this they'll be a lightning
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.560]   version so they just say well there's a there's a lightning it's just a different
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.680]   connect yeah for those people but for anybody who's got third party headphones
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.080]   like all the beats users so speaking of a company apple spent a lot of money to buy
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.320]   that makes custom headphones it's going to be frustrating if they if they go
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.440]   down that path but but saying that it's for the quest for thinnows i think bundles
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.720]   those two things together and the way that's not real quest for weirdness
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.440]   quest is for charging us thirty dollars for a tiny adapter
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.000]   i want the quest for shatterproof yeah right water proof i think is coming and
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.160]   and drop proof is the next real thing that i i wanted my phone i mean besides the
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.040]   thinnest thing i think johnnie i've also has a thing for
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.640]   eliminating ports such as with the new mac block and uh well that goes back
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.440]   out he and steve jobs were really simpatico on that steve
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.120]   never met a button he didn't want to remove for a product and the apotheosis of that
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.760]   was that ipod shuffle that had no buttons at all
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.160]   which was unusable because you had to have uh headphone plugged in and then use
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.200]   the clicker on on the headphone uh cord
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.640]   and uh the next version of that you know they went back to the previous design
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.520]   which is one of the only times you've ever seen apple basically back off of a
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.880]   product design entirely and abandon it and it was because they
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.840]   you know philosophically i think johnnie i've still has this like get rid of all
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.280]   the ports get rid of all the buttons make it a simple like it's a block of
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.240]   aluminum that's the ultimate apple product is just
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.440]   an incredibly thin block of aluminum in class when it can all be wireless
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.480]   including the power they will try to happen right that'll happen
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.160]   and this is wireless charging that there's s7 i just put another thing and it
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.000]   charges right that has high speed wireless charging i do feel with the new mac book
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.560]   though it's not inconceivable they will do one with
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.120]   a couple of ports a couple of ports just because it does
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.560]   even uh a year later that does seem to be sort of a
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.360]   obstacle for a lot of people you know the original macbook air only had one
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.640]   usb port and and when they did the redesign of that a couple years later
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.560]   it had to yeah and it was much better product when they did it's way more
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.320]   successful yeah apple is not what you might think apple doesn't
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.800]   admit mistakes but apple admits its mistakes and
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.760]   it's i think it's uh it comes with trying to push things forward a little bit
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.160]   that apple will push things a little too far
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:12.040]   too fast and then the second round of a product will be way more usable and
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.280]   macbook air is the best example that first macbook air
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.040]   was ridiculous i had one it was ridiculous but this the second generation
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.840]   was pretty great the eleven inch the little teeny one
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.640]   well the the first one was the thirteen i think it was the one with a little
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.800]   door you had to open in order to get to your i'd like to like the macbook i
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.640]   would like to see a new macbook i bought that this dongle for the macbook
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.160]   that solves that port problem a little bit it plugs into the seaport
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.440]   it kind of matches the look and feel of the macbook and then it gives you a
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.760]   SD card a micro SD card two usb three ports and another charging port
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:47.080]   so you can have it as a pass through but still charge murphy's law of dongles
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:51.000]   yeah this dongle will be lost yeah and the thing is is when you will sit on it
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.320]   you know and i'll look and i won't be able to figure out why you didn't even
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.160]   realize you needed it until you were up creeque one day and then you thought
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.040]   oh my god i need up for me it's always ethernet but
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:03.560]   well that's that's the only you didn't notice that that's why i carry it
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.480]   that is a merciful
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.160]   mercs and has everything in it i even have an ethernet port in this
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.520]   mercy dang you see this is i think that's going to be the story
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.160]   if apple does remove the headphone jack from the phone it's not going to be
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.280]   about the people are like yeah it's like earbuds i'm fine but one day they're
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.080]   going to be at a party somewhere and somebody's going to be like oh
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.000]   you brought the music right okay plug it in here and they're going to go oh no
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.680]   and that'll be the end of it dude that that's dongleitis
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.640]   uh you posted this it's a new month and that means
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.560]   douglas synfeld is at it again with his drone i don't know why apple lets him do
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.360]   this but i guess they haven't been going to do shoot it down yeah
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.320]   please it's over their air space please wait a minute actually that's an
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.880]   interesting question how high does he have to fly
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.840]   to be in uh public air space what is the rule on that
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.760]   i do not know is this for commercial uses because they could go after him for
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:58.360]   that i think it's for commercial uses by by far well they could petition the
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.640]   FAA it poses on youtube every month this is
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.800]   the march 2016 apple campus it is actually he's
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.920]   he's gotten better and better this was amazing to see this campus
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:16.280]   hq march 2016 boom boom boom and if you've been watching these
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.120]   videos he puts out they're beautiful uh you've been really watching the
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.320]   progress in the spaceship campus it's it's uh it's coming
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.480]   coming along quite far uh does it open it's been a year off right
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.760]   i think that's the what it seems like they've said 2017
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.720]   Tim cook was talking about how excited he is about moving
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.320]   into it and uh for the first time 12 000 employees will be in the same
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.600]   building yeah they're all spread out now among many buildings yeah
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.320]   basically all of kupertino is all of its available space is apple employees now
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.520]   they've spilled out everywhere it's just too big a company one of the
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.960]   really interesting questions is do they name this the steve jobs can't
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.680]   be or the steve job i mean there's a steve jobs building at
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.040]   Pixar and i think that Tim Cook interview that i saw
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.800]   that you also saw was um suggestion that they will do something and they're
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.680]   working with the family on it but i know that they had a big dedication for
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.360]   the steve jobs building at Pixar um and i imagine the same thing will have
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:12.120]   been on the new campus this is about as poorly kept secret as
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.160]   patent-manning retiring what's the address going to be as
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.040]   infinite loop in a move no no no maybe yeah maybe this is a
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.880]   one infinite loop that's one infinite loop this is steve jobs circle unless
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.240]   they sell it are they gonna sell the old spaceship circle perhaps i don't know
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.520]   are they getting rid of the old i don't know i don't believe so i mean they're
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.960]   my understanding is they need so many people that they're going to need uh
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.320]   to keep the existing campus the new campus and there's talk that they may
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.360]   actually try to build something else in san hose i think wow because they need
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.920]   they want their people to work together that's the other thing is a lot of these
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.080]   places in kupertino where they have offices um you know it's a floor here
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.000]   and then a couple floors over there and they're not as collaborative
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   workspaces because there's no room i'll pay anybody buildings these underground
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.960]   tunnels are worthy of dr no i mean these are kind of
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.680]   this is this is scary stuff like that you the parking is underground much of it
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.600]   but wait did you say 20 000 employees 12 000 to this one
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.240]   okay so that's there's 12 000 employees in 10 000
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.080]   nine hundred parking spaces well some of them will carpool right that's
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.000]   that's actually more more manageable i mean at yahoo every year
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.480]   the the parking spaces got repainted smaller really that's how they saw that
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.440]   when marissa said you couldn't work from home anymore they just went
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.480]   i i remember when i was pregnant i had to stop going there because i couldn't
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.960]   get out of my car it was all i was like i don't have a handy cap placard i don't
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.080]   know what to do you can't actually fit through the door
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.800]   and for people who don't know about silicon valley it's essentially the
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.080]   suburbs they built all of this office infrastructure in the suburbs so there's
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:48.120]   no public transportation yeah and so it's it's kind of a terrible place to have
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:51.800]   big companies because everybody has to commute by car that's really the only
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.400]   way to do it are those freaking shuttle buses or yes the or the buses that
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.600]   everybody hates really i think riding them and it's quite
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:05.080]   not to be sweet right yeah Wi-Fi enabled leather seats you work on your way to
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.440]   work you get there you go to the gym many of them have massage therapist in
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   the bus oh my god hundreds of thousands but i think it's a good idea
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.320]   it's possible anything is plausible at this point
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.360]   there was a hundred thousand square foot fitness center
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.640]   being constructed at this new apple campus
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.840]   i think it was stated forever the shuttle buses too yeah
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.120]   the fitness bus pulls alongside and you can get it actually powered by
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.880]   cyclists inside thank you donkansin field for the
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.280]   beautiful video of the apple campuses got to be shooting these on reds now i mean
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.840]   he's really upgraded the production value and the
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.240]   beautiful drone it's not in here but uh DJI 4
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:50.520]   this week with auto sensing so the drones now can have collision
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:55.000]   avoidance oh um that's a good idea yeah i like
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.960]   that i mean they do the whole virtual cable so
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:02.760]   basically you can program a route for the drone to go from one point to the
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.600]   next um can it follow me that's what i want
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.040]   somebody's made some that follow you you have like a device on your wrist or
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.840]   something three robotics has that you can run it off your pebble you can run it
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.320]   on the phone uh chris anderson who used to be at
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.600]   wired who's now at three d robotics he gave me a full demo of that it's
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.360]   pretty incredible and seeing that virtual cable in the sky is amazing
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.800]   what's the virtual cable so you pick a point on a google map
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.080]   that's in uh like a satellite map that's in their
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.440]   their app you pick point a you pick point b
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.920]   and it just goes back and forth and back and forth it's not unlike this uh if
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.600]   you're looking right here at this little auto slider that you have in front of
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.360]   us here it just constantly on a cable going back and forth
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.040]   so the big thing here in the phantom four
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.960]   is that they have collision avoidance because this is one of the huge elements
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.720]   for the faa as they think about the future of drones oh so wouldn't just be
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.520]   other drones it could it would be other everybody aircraft and more
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.640]   importantly buildings yeah people right yeah i was
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:06.120]   at um at uh mofford field the other week at nasa ams research and they did a
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:10.520]   a demo of their next generation air traffic control for drones basically
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.880]   and their vision is that you will be able to file a drone flight plan
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:18.520]   basically by uh by web form or web service and you can you can say i want
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.040]   to go here here's one i want to go and it will provide you a route and
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.320]   basically send it to your drone and say here's your route this is your air
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.160]   space it's about like a hundred yards wide it lasts for this amount of time
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.320]   and it just comp it compiles all the drone flight plans and make sure that they
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.120]   don't interact and if it can't get you from point a to point b it'll kick it
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.160]   back and say how about a different time how about a different route
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.840]   uh it's pretty amazing that it makes sense right i mean this is all technology
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.280]   we've got we should be able to do this this really is the ultimate selfie though
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.720]   to have a drone as you do things following you
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.800]   pro following you around making sure that not a
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.640]   single shot is missed of anything in your most important life have you seen the
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.240]   lily drone the lily drone um it's kind of vaporware right now
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.800]   let me rephrase that it was a kickstarter that they put a
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.200]   amazing video out for basically it's this little orb
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.720]   and this guy throws it off of a bridge and it launches into a full-fledged
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.200]   drone and it follows you around um it was incredible i called him i said hey this
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.240]   is amazing we want to do this on good morning america and we don't actually
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   have one that worked it finds so that was about six months ago it was a 3d rendering
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:35.160]   but watch this throw and go boom and then the guy takes off on his snowboard
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.000]   and the drone is following behind him about what do you think that is 20 30
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.640]   yards and getting all of his motion so he's not carrying a stick he doesn't
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.480]   have a helmet cam this one he was wearing a wristband right i think yeah it's a
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.840]   it's a it's its own proprietary and then it comes to you
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:57.640]   after you're done that's falconry now we haven't seen this i haven't seen
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.920]   this let me read this looks like real video on their website
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.840]   there as i i guess it could be cgi i think it's probably real i just don't
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.960]   know if they've come up with the production element yeah
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.160]   pretty simple version but i think that 3d robotics is
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.040]   as shown um what is wrong with it are we the most
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.640]   self-centered society in the history of mankind
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.760]   that we spend all this energy to develop cameras to follow us around
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.600]   hi oh it's nice of you to join us on
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.400]   oh right we have six cameras right here
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.760]   it's like what are we gonna create our own network
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.360]   are we gonna create our own network that follows all of our interests and
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.000]   movements i admit i don't probably have standard this
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.480]   the standing to complain but it does seem like this is a little solipsist
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.960]   well yeah but from a cinematography standpoint even
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.720]   gorgeous and sports and um you know i go back to the go pro philosophy
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.760]   which does you know nick woodman's whole philosophy is he wants
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.200]   every athlete to feel like a professional right
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.600]   even if they're not uh it was your colleague david pok who pointed out that
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.200]   one of the reasons we love drones is we never we're like ants on the surface of
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.360]   a map we never see anything but our own 2d perspective
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.520]   and it's so i have to agree with him that when you see the first time
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.280]   just what it looks like from above it's a unique perspective and it's pretty
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.880]   exciting i think that's probably the appeal of this
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.640]   marie what's gonna happen with drones i mean it's just amazing how much it has
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.360]   happened i'm trying to think when parrot came out with
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.800]   their first consumer drone we're seeing that at ces the first time in it
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.040]   five years ago maybe it's probably uh i don't know you use an iphone to steer it
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.560]   it was hard i mean i do i do feel in terms of whether
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.200]   people are just doing it to play as themselves it's self-correcting if
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.920]   the only person who wants to watch your drone video is you
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.160]   that's really sad i love this stuff is really cool
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.240]   right and as long as at least one other person
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.720]   thinks the video shot is cool um then it's not being self-absorbed it's
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.840]   right that you have to do something interesting
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.360]   it's no point eventually eventually it will become kind of trite because
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.120]   everybody will have these eventually yeah i think some of the uh
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.560]   excitement of seeing the world from above will wear off there's a huge amount of
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.520]   novelty now i mean i mean it's sort of like in
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.400]   i guess maybe the 80s when people first started to have
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.640]   camcorders and any sort of actually remember i had a friend who
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.760]   went to taiwan and took a video camera that involved a vcr
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.200]   on a shoulder strap and he walked around uh and just shot what he saw and it was
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.280]   totally mind-bending at the time it's completely mundane now right
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.880]   and drones will eventually be like that my version of that story is i had a
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.440]   friend in the 80s and 90s he was a helicopter pilot on
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.560]   Maui and he was shooting all the big wave surfing
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.760]   a big trough came that took the ground out from underneath his rotor wash and
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.320]   therefore his his helicopter dropped and the wave came right over him
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:01.240]   so now flash forward to today it's been the biggest big wave surfing season
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.760]   in history at peyahi at jaws there are drones everywhere there shooting the
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.920]   most amazing footage practically from inside the tube following the
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   surfer as he goes through it's a completely different view of one of
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.040]   the most is your hazard is your hazard with all these drones
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.960]   um ask uh what does it enricia glasius did he get hit
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.440]   the one who got the his finger got cut he had one right up in front of him he
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.720]   was performing to it and he stuck his finger in it there was a
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.240]   don't ever do that but see that's where the contact avoidance is so important
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.040]   because we should have backed away if it's if that's its last mode of self-defense
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.360]   then you can see where that becomes an issue i was i'm wondering there was
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.720]   such panic over drones a few months ago and i was wondering it has
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.200]   has it gone away or uh not and then i i realized i've just seen
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.760]   at least two articles about near misses with commercial air traffic but in
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.760]   trowse-agal air france uh very close miss and uh according to the guardian there
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:05.000]   have been four near miss incidents at uk airports including
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.320]   a passenger jet taking off from london stanstead don't forget all the fires
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.000]   where people bring out drones to take pictures of the of like wildfires
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.840]   and the uh the air attack people are trying to
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.760]   put out the fires and the drones are in the way and the air and the
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.120]   they had to back off the air attack the air attack people
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:30.600]   um uh seven seven seven taking off from he throw sauce an 18 inch drone passing
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.200]   less than a wingspan away from the plane uh that is a
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.320]   absolute near miss and you might say well that an 18 inch drone what could that
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.440]   do to a triple seven it could bring it down a pigeon can bring
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.440]   down a plane so uh so these are i guess it is something
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.240]   still to be worried about 200 people killed since 1988 because of airborne
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.960]   collisions with birds so there you go imagine well there's a lot of birds
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.600]   i don't know that off hand just in case you guys were worried i was
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.000]   really up on how impressed bird collision staff
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.120]   i was taking a break i want to ask you about yahoo's you're not there anymore
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.680]   what's going on over there um like he warley is here formerly with yahoo
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.680]   news david's still there though right yeah he transferred over to news out of
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.080]   the tech vertical well they killed a lot of the verticals
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.560]   a lot of yeah let's talk about that also jason stelph from uh it's nice to be
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.520]   independent isn't it yeah although i was doing some freelance work for
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.040]   for yahoo too that i'm not anymore i was writing space columns for them which
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.480]   was a real kick to write uh about space space is
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.080]   awesome yeah it is and there's lots of it there's a whole lot of it
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.000]   it's a growth it's a growth location
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.640]   uh also goes on for miles the technologizer harry mccrack and our show
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:41.960]   today brought to you by wealth front where i think you uh know that you should be
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.200]   saving money for if for the rainy day ahead whether it's your retirement the
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.800]   kids going to college maybe you want to get a down payment on a house
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.120]   long-term savings are very important but the question is where do you put that
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.240]   money i was just looking at savings account interest rates i can't believe
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.000]   how low they are now um much less than one percent a year
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.960]   often maybe a quarter or a half percent a year
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.560]   i got my interest the reason i was interested in this i got my uh
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.400]   my check for my bank for my savings interest three cents
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.000]   and i thought you know i actually might have lost money by putting in a savings
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.160]   account you might as well put it a mattress
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.360]   well wealth front has a better way for you to invest now
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.440]   many people try to invest for themselves the problem with that is you don't have
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.600]   the time to keep an eye on this 24/7 you don't have time probably to check
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.800]   it every quarter uh so you're going to hire somebody
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.320]   we'll wait a minute investment advisors charge one
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.880]   two sometimes three percent of the money under management every year that
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.760]   means you have to make three percent more to break even
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.520]   it's tough wealth front is a great idea because you
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.240]   are not using humans you're using software and you're paying one quarter
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.560]   of one percent a year with no commissions no hidden fees
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.360]   very affordable and by the way in my opinion it does a better job than any
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.280]   human can do first of all wealth fronts put together advisory board of some of
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.040]   the best investment people in the world 200 years of investment experience
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.720]   no bell prize winning academic research best practices
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.400]   people like charles d ales burt and malkeel who really literally
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.400]   wrote the books the books that i read when i thought i could do this myself
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.680]   well what if you took their minds their brains their knowledge
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:31.480]   and put it into software that monitors your investment 24/7
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.160]   can make trades on your it's not i'm not talking about this is not
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.960]   day trading this is not flash trading but they are constantly monitoring your
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.280]   portfolio constantly rebalancing doing things like tax lost harvesting to
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.320]   increase your return while minimizing your taxes
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:53.720]   it's all built in really most most portfolios that the estimate is about
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.720]   ninety percent of all portfolios are not properly invested for long term
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.800]   if you have long-term savings if you if you don't you want to and if you have
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.880]   them you've got to check out wealth front you can start as little as 500 bucks
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.160]   uh... and this is a nice little treat
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.480]   uh... for your first fifteen thousand dollars of investment at wealth front
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.840]   no fee at all not even one quarter one percent forever
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.800]   but you have to use wealth front dot com slash twit so here's the deal i don't
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.560]   want you to invest without reading about it
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.360]   go to the website wealth front dot com slash
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.480]   twit
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:30.520]   read up uh... reassure yourself as i have that this is a really great service
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.200]   that really makes sense
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.600]   you can even get uh... free portfolio generated for you so you'll see what
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.000]   they would invest in based on your

[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.840]   this is the great profile of yahoo
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.920]   when i first went to yahoo i did a was that right after tech tv yes and it was
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.800]   when terry summel was the c_o_ terry summel and all i would like hired his
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.600]   bff who had just finished producing friends

[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.200]   now house wow house it was horrible it was so painful
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.000]   i hope it doesn't live please let it was unfortunately before youtube so
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.880]   probably you're safe i have the right to be forgotten
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.680]   on that one then i will move on to the next stage which was yahoo tech pat houston
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.160]   and that cardwell steve enders
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.680]   robin raskin i'm forgetting a bunch of great people um
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:33.800]   jina hues um chris knoll that was great that was their first real tech vertical
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.840]   we met wow house was a reality program it was reality
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.280]   hitting two families in a competition to determine which could do a more
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.520]   successful tech upgrade for ten grand wow house wow house
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.880]   yeah um wow yeah seventy something thousand it was
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.320]   oh it's then they renamed it to hook me up so much better
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.800]   so much better please let me crawl into the table now
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.000]   so then yahoo tech that whole vertical died
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.120]   and now they came back with the new one which
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.920]   and i had a show uh actually this is my that was my fourth
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.320]   um i had a show called upgrade your life which was so much fun and it was
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.960]   kind of a life hacker martha stewart meets technology
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:20.600]   a little bit of everything and that i i really am proud of and love and still
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.440]   so many of the things are evergreen and had a great production team
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:30.520]   then when you're are we now yeah i know then david pogue came in
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.240]   and they did the whole tech vertical that was the tech vertical right
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.280]   leeberman who's in the new york times who came over and they did that all
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.920]   that brave nadaman went over there brave a bunch of great great people um
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.640]   and now they've just shelved that one all they're almost all the verticals
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.720]   got shelved right uh and what folded into uh news
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.720]   so it just seemed yeah that's kind of sad i mean they really put a lot of
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.920]   money and effort and i think here's the problem yahoo's trying to do with so
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.400]   many have tried and failed to do before which is make tech
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.280]   accessible and interesting to normal people and it turns out really nobody's
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.400]   that interested it just it's not a subcategory
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.440]   in so many ways well that that's that's the irony of it
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.560]   nobody was interested before because it was just geeks and then suddenly it was
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.200]   so much a part of your life that it isn't separate it's just
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.800]   your life well that's why i'm as much a consumer reporter as i am a tech reporter
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.000]   when it comes to mainstream media they're the same thing in the eyes of those
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.840]   folks yahoo this was a few weeks ago but i still find this fascinating time
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:31.400]   considering buying yahoo yep a reverse morris trust
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:37.160]   which means that it's when a smaller company tries to buy a bigger company
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:43.160]   and wait a minute time time life Warner AOL time
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.080]   time ink refused to be used to work for this
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.160]   time ink which was spun off from time Warner so tine hink is a small little
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.280]   that's fairly small it's principally engaged in the publishing of print
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.360]   magazines it has a lot of online stuff going on but it certainly would like
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.920]   to have more of a interesting 23,000 videos they made last year according to
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.200]   joe ripp who's the ceo they have a billion dollars in subscriptions but
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.400]   they have no products and services so they're like hey let's get yahoo
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:14.760]   digital eyeballs products and services production wing if i wanted to buy yahoo
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:20.040]   now what would it cost me uh they just got an offer last week
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:25.080]   from a japanese company that raised its price target
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.560]   to yahoo on yahoo to thirty two dollars a share up from 29 i'm sorry i don't
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.680]   want the market cap offhand and it's been a little unclear because they have
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.400]   this investment nalibaba which has been that all i think they spun that
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.440]   on the right to but then so there are times when
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.880]   so the market cap is exactly 32 billion if you there are times where if you do the
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.840]   math the rest of yahoo isn't worth anything because the market
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.200]   is the same as the investment so if you so what you do is you spin off
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   ollie bobba get your money back and now you've got free content rather than
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.480]   spring off ollie bobba they're planning to spin off yahoo
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:02.040]   yeah oh i get it reverse that's the reverse morris and it has a
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.920]   major tax benefit because they don't have to pay taxes on the asset of the
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.880]   of what they're selling to a smaller company in fact wasn't that what happened
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.560]   was that the board had been assured by they thought by the irs that there would
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.160]   be no tax consequence to spinning off ollie bobba and then the irs back
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.440]   track said well we can't promise you that the board said uh oh
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.120]   you know we could sell it but we might be you know might lose half the uh
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.240]   the profits in taxes they spent a year working on
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.160]   the spin out and then cited not to do it and now they're saying either they'll
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.400]   spin off the rest of yahoo or they might sell up to one buyer
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.000]   such as time or verizon or they might break it up
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.120]   or they might just not do anything do any of these
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:48.840]   changes involve morissa mire or she kind of she would not go to time
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.360]   right that would make no sense what would happen
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.040]   so okay which she there's nothing for her to run
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.680]   she would run the outcropping of the ollie bobba that's left over and they
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.480]   wouldn't have to pay her parachute they would not
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.000]   no because because firing her would cost him a hundred some million dollars
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.120]   she'd be like one of those workers that you remember reading about the
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.880]   roof and the window the window where window workers right they just they
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.720]   come in to sit at the window they look out more
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.760]   fully and then they go home at the end of that on the roof at hooley they have
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.280]   lunch sure nothing to do uh i think i did that for ziff
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:26.360]   davis for about six months jina jina smith and i
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.840]   yeah in principle worked for ziff davis but we had no portfolio we paid got
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.960]   paid well it was i think it was like almost a hundred thousand dollars a year
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.120]   not to do anything um sorry i mean that's sad
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.120]   it's all crushing but well that's when i started all the reading stuff right
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:47.320]   and then um mgm said oh we want to partner with ziff davis to do
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.720]   television as if davis had been apparently very interested in
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.680]   television so um they sent me and jina down to mgm but they said but they
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.400]   pulled me inside and said but we're not we're not going to do anything so just
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   go down there and pretend you're working so i got a card key to the mgm
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.080]   backlot and got offices i don't think i ever went back to that office i think
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.800]   i went there once
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.200]   i want to talk about the google autonomous car accident okay when we're gonna get
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.640]   to that i want to finish y'all okay this is a true professional she is
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.240]   decided she's gonna host the show she is the better host than i am
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.680]   if we could just hire her i would retire it's only because there's just such a
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.120]   black hole we could go down into i mean we are gonna do this that's absolutely
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.880]   made kara swit's a career i can't let this show degrade into this
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.720]   yahoo has yes yeah in fact what is kara gonna do forget marissa mire what is
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:39.640]   kara gonna do there's nothing i mean nothing to write about
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.560]   so uh what do you think is going to happen i mean by the way nobody
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.600]   in the real world probably cares about this we only care because yahoo
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:52.280]   was yahoo it was aca bono.stanford.edu it was jerry and david it was
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.880]   it was one of the very first internet companies i think we care because this
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.520]   may be the actual end game when it sounds like it is when marissa came on there
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.680]   was a lot of excitement it seemed like the one
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:07.320]   hail mary that might pan out and it has not panned out has she been that you
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.040]   could be candid has she been a failure
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.480]   all i know is since she's been there she gave birth to three kids so i have so
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.760]   much respect for the woman now to be fair one was twin one
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   set was twins oh my i had three in a row i mean that is i'm just i know that's
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.560]   totally sidebar and as a woman i shouldn't make it about that but i just
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.360]   have i have personally she did an earnings call two days before
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.200]   she had the c-section of her twins i'm just so blown away she's one of those
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.080]   people that schedules the birth i think you don't have choice when you have
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.200]   twins they're like they're coming out i guess that's it you have twins you know
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   yes i do you have a real reason to respect that
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:49.320]   but i have i tell you i think marissa mire is brilliant i think she might not
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.400]   have been the right person for the job but that was a job that very i don't know
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.240]   if anybody could have done that i think given the trajectory yahoo has been on
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.440]   since the terry semel days perhaps the mark of her
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.200]   tenure will be the price the shareholders walk away with that's going to be the
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.840]   final yeah deciding and i feel bad breaking it down to such
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.840]   a sort of pecuniary no but when you're a CEO of a company that's
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.000]   your job and there's so many good people there i i have that's what's sad yeah
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.800]   but the good news is every breakup is a diaspora right and so that's what happened
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.240]   tech t_b_ we all went on it's a networking opportunity for all those
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.160]   people to find new people i mean so i i i hope the best
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.120]   i i hope the best for the shareholder value
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.880]   i'm sad to see one go down but they just chose the wrong path
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.480]   what uh... happens to people working there right now how do they feel are they
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.720]   kind of dejected i mean
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.720]   david pogel left the new york times to go to yahoo
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:53.560]   he left a very good job i don't know his story because he's gonna do fine he's
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.160]   got new york media folks who went with uh... megan leeberman who came from the
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.400]   new york times that's a different animal yeah
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.640]   but the people in sunny vale are so battle-hardened i'm bad you've never
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.560]   seen anybody who can handle a reorg better than those folks
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.400]   oh here comes again
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.920]   yeah okay oh should i bring lunch today yeah
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.440]   yeah or snacks out or what yeah do we get snacks
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.560]   that's when i knew it was over tech tv no snacks no snacks
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.800]   with the first day
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.520]   first they came for the makeup artists and i did not protest
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.280]   then they came for the wardrobe artists i said nothing
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.880]   then they came for the floor managers the stage directors and i
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.480]   of

[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.480]   uh it's uh it's uh he apparently harvey winstein
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.840]   who is one of the great movie producers of hollywood
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.880]   takes a took a shine to kal canis and sign him up for a show that's headed to

[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.920]   like kind of like uh the apprentice there'll be 12 startups we'll compete for
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.840]   funding kal canis fires one each week until the end
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.560]   and the winning startup will get a first round of funding worth maybe a million
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.000]   to maybe even three million it'll be the kal canis already sounding like
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.120]   donald trump yeah it'll be the hugest prize in the
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:21.800]   history of television hugest so i think i think Jason
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.920]   Jason he's gonna be great it's gonna be awesome and i feel like
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:28.520]   he's got political aspirations i feel like that's the first step
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.520]   to running for something he's great tv he's very polarizing and that's what
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.160]   makes great tv he will be good one television is
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:39.240]   visuals first emotion second yeah and there've been many shows about
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.360]   silicon valley all of them have stunk yep except for
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.720]   silicon vlogs but the shark tank style shows this is not the first reality
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.960]   show randy zuckerberg did one that was i didn't even see it was gone before
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.640]   you could see it it's reality is all about characters
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:02.120]   and so they have to be memorable and he is he is i think he should get us on
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.840]   that show though yeah let's in some way some form or fashion
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.320]   yep we'll streak it i know he's listening we'll streak it
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.400]   google car self-driving car
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.080]   it has been in many accidents but in every case it was the humans fault not
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.680]   the driver human driver but the other cars fault
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.600]   not so this one let's take a break and we'll talk about it
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:31.000]   when we come back but i i think it's time to do another ad i
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.160]   i have to keep track of these i get i get out of
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.840]   order and i'm really excited about apple that's why
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.200]   there was this apple thing is so fascinating and it's
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.040]   it's worth talking about it at great depth especially with
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.880]   with good minds well and in every show for the last two weeks is all we've
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.320]   talked about but i think what's happened is as we've talked about it's boiled
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.400]   down so we're now doing the apple pyrous the apple encryption
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.200]   reduction yes it's a demi gloss it's a demi gloss where it's a very rich

[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.120]   light are spinning
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.160]   and the cameras and then they have those little cute autonomous vehicles the
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.120]   cute ones
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.160]   uh... don't have steering wheel they don't have pedal they have a break the one
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.280]   that got an accident was the one with the
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.640]   pedal the break and driver
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:46.080]   and it got a kind of a weird situation it was in mountain view
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.760]   google campuses there
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.320]   and it was driving down uh... city street
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.720]   and you normally if you're gonna make a right turn you get the right most
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.160]   lane
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.760]   except that this one had a big pothole in it
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:02.820]   and the car comes up to the pothole it's called off and it's got sandbags
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:05.240]   cars stuck
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.160]   decides to get merge back in a traffic to get to make the right turn
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.360]   so turns on its blinker sees a bus coming
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.520]   and then
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.960]   plows into it to us about how are it hits the bus
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:22.280]   it doesn't hit the bus it hits it in the most vulnerable portion of any bus
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.960]   right there in the crotch
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.680]   it's one of those uh... double buses double extensible buses in the cholines
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.120]   yeah it's in the joint
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.960]   not you know i don't know if there's a lot of damage
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.000]   lot of information from a lot of discussion about this i don't know if the
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.140]   bus driver was mad he's he said he saw the attack he saw the
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.000]   it was a google thomas vehicle and it's to be presumed that bus drivers a
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.160]   counter them a lot in mount view
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:48.240]   the driver said uh... google said the car did see the bus
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.960]   but thought it would let it in
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.920]   ask the driver
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.360]   and the driver said yeah i saw it
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.880]   i thought this is going to be a problem i'll let the car handle it
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.520]   and that bus did not let him in and hit the bus at two miles an hour
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.240]   nobody was hurt
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.000]   so this is what's going on the car the google cars are getting more
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.920]   aggressive intentionally
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:13.100]   the problem is in this is a very challenging computer science problem
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.940]   for autonomous vehicle
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.880]   humans have all sorts of signals about all you go i'll go
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.060]   you look the driver in the eye disease c_u_ is he slowing down okay it's my
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.940]   turn to go
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.460]   kit there's no
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:28.540]   nothing to look at with a dot on his vehicle
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:31.940]   it may very well be the bus driver thought all this stock
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:33.580]   it's just gonna sit there
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:34.660]   uh... or
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.020]   didn't you know i don't have to let it in it's a it's a robot
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.740]   car i don't know what the bus driver
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.980]   have you ever
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.540]   been behind a bus next to bus in front of a bus
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.860]   but don't care about we we know
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.100]   the last thing you do is challenge a bus
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.540]   that's it completely right
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:50.580]   but the computer doesn't have that
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.140]   and that's basically what googles
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:56.140]   press release about this said is we're going to take this as a learning
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:57.660]   yeah experience
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:01.580]   about treating buses and other large vehicles differently than other cars
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.660]   which is like because i i try to put myself in that situation that's exactly
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.900]   what i would think is like
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:09.440]   okay i could risk getting plowed into by a bus or i could just wait for the
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.500]   bus to go by because i don't trust any bus
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.980]   was language
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.860]   uh... google said it has reviewed the incident and quote
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:19.380]   thousands of variations of it on our simulator in detail
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:23.340]   he's a minute to our software and this is the key from now on our cars will more
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:27.140]   deeply understand that buses and other large vehicles
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.620]   are less likely to yield to us
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.660]   then other types of vehicles
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.100]   we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully and that's the
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:34.940]   will keep win
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.260]   let's let the work you have
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:40.220]   that's the like it let the wookie win world i think you're right
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.980]   and they're already programmed to
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.460]   see things like traffic cones and know that they should be more careful but
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.100]   i guess in this case they saw the traffic cones the sandbags
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.140]   and they thought they know a way out
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:52.300]   well they're also
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:56.420]   there you know the cars have been so cautious up to now that they have it
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.660]   they've actually been pushing the be a little less cautious because they want
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:00.380]   it
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.700]   they're really cautious yeah and so
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.580]   you we talked about this on twig on wednesday
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.980]   uh... unit the worst thing that happens in california we have four way stops
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.900]   which have very arcane rules about goes if everybody arrives at different
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:14.340]   time it's not a problem first person goes first
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:18.140]   uh... if you arrive at the same time then you have to then it's more complicated
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:21.300]   but the worst thing they can happen to four way stop is a driver who gets
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.340]   their first his turn who waits
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:24.580]   and goes no no you
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:28.220]   yet so it's the most annoying confusing
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.380]   dangerous thing to do
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.580]   is to be too passive
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:36.100]   and i think what google was deciding is these cars are too passive
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.980]   and uh... that's not the best way to drive to do you have to have it driving
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.700]   turns out to be an interaction with the other drivers
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.500]   and you you can't be just kind of
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.340]   okay you can
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:49.740]   your turn every driver has a personality so what's the personality of the google
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.660]   car yeah
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.620]   going to be they're trying a little to be a little more aggressive
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:57.100]   also it varies so much from region to region of
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:00.380]   a google salt driving car embossed and needs to drive quite differently
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:03.220]   than what i'm out in the air
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:06.780]   are there a time that would actually be that the final exam
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:08.740]   can you drive in boston
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:12.620]   that's where i learned how to drive really not
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.060]   uh...
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:17.100]   brad templeton is does a lot of work on autonomous vehicles were a great blog
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.300]   post he pointed out that in india
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.580]   uh...
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:24.340]   lanes are just a suggestion
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:28.500]   that their most co-street stony have lanes painted in and if they do no one
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:29.640]   it's not really
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.400]   he called to lane road five land
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.540]   in many parts of the world in the town is vehicles gonna really have a
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:40.380]   challenge because it's kind of have to impute human motives it's gonna have to
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.300]   kind of understand what's going on
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.880]   what was that did you have that uh... video uh...
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.340]   jason none of the uh... san francisco street but of the uh...
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:53.300]   traffic intersection in in india
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:57.620]   that we showed it was uh... it gives you an idea of how
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:00.340]   hard it would be
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.580]   to learn how to drive
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:05.140]   unless you'd learn your whole life it's almost like it that you could be
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.780]   fluent
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:10.420]   this is a yes slightly sped up there's no
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:13.460]   there's no roundabout there's no markings there's no lights
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.100]   it's just negotiated
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:18.660]   and is negotiated in you know nearly real time and by the way it's not just
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:21.300]   cars and buses their people
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.940]   what crossing the street
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:25.300]   and i don't
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.580]   that was a good one yeah it's kind of fun to watch because it's like what the
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.740]   bus just went right through it
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:33.140]   that's the third bus that has it doesn't care does not care
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.860]   don't care that's really efficient do they have more accidents than we do
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.660]   yes
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.860]   in fact after i showed this video somebody in the chatroom pointed out that there
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:43.140]   are thirty one something like thirty one times more fatal accidents in india
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.460]   than there are in the United States in the great britain
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:48.420]   Beijing has sort of been like that when i was there as well
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:52.660]   i uh... do you have a drive and count how many different things have to
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:56.020]   grab your attention sorry minute i mean it's incredible when you actually
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:59.620]   think about the signal processing that's going on in our brains
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.980]   as you drive it's unfathomable the human brain is
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:06.660]   uniquely well suited to this because we're massively parallel
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.900]   we also uh...
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.900]   are good at learning uh... autonomous things a lot of driving is autonomous
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.540]   just like walking running
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.180]   if you thought about walking
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.980]   you couldn't do it freak out
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:21.540]   yes this is why you feel it when you are when you take a long drive
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.900]   right and you and your your exhaust you feel mentally exhausted the end of the
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:28.020]   week we are doing it as we all we are we all tend to think that unless you're
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:30.820]   doing something physical you're not exhausting so that the fact is you're
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.900]   using a brain you're on edge your brain is burning calories when you think
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:37.700]   a lot like they did it to study like people who are doing
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.940]   math tests or something like that in the fact is
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:43.700]   it it's real exertion and it takes a toll and you drive
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.660]   did to the store for a you know for some groceries and it's not that big
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.460]   deal but you drive to from san francisco to l_a_
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.500]   and you are
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.420]   toast by the time you get to the end of it
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:55.220]   so thanks self-driving cars maybe
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:56.860]   do you ever have a bad commute
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.900]   like the long-term oh yeah i used to drive so i when i worked at
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:03.780]   as if davis actually i i i was in foster city and i lived in the east
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:06.820]   space where i had a a bridge commute
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:10.340]   and to go through a canyon and a bunch of city streets and over a bridge ever
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:13.220]   uh... the worst at the end of the community and not remember doing the
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:17.300]   commute oh yeah oh especially that's what scares me it's like i was a blackout
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:20.500]   condition or we're talking about oj simpson earlier like i was listening to
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:23.540]   the news coverage of the trial and the white bronco chase and all that
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.180]   and and or if you're listening to an audiobook or something and then you
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:28.180]   you get out of the car you like
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:31.860]   i don't even remember the stop signs or the street lights because i was just
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:35.060]   sort of focused on what i was listening to and the autonomous
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:38.980]   driver part of me was all the time and you hold it right right yeah
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:42.580]   so i got to go with Sebastian thron in the first google car
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:47.780]   use the head of x yeah google x division right was and that was for gma and it
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.900]   was the first press ride in the car and we didn't know what it was going to be
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.980]   like we had seen any video from it
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:57.300]   it was a little harky jerky and weird to see the thing moving by itself and it
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:00.900]   was kind of scary did you get in i got in and then i also this is the one without
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.660]   a steering wheel and pedals uh like the little no it was a road test so we had
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:09.460]   to yeah this was back probably six and a half years ago maybe the first the
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:13.540]   first one that was a pre-us yeah and then i also stepped in front of it to see if
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:17.860]   it would stop it should did but i just remember thinking it was this
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:22.900]   foreign entity terrifying and then last year at ces i was in the bmw self-driving
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.780]   car in the back seat while it drove me driverless
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:30.580]   nobody in the front seat from point a to point b in their controlled environment
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:34.980]   and the next time i got in a car to drive i was disappointed i was so
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:40.180]   easily uh acclimated to the idea of the no-kiddin so you got used it was scary at
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:44.420]   first but you got used to it it was amazing how fast your brain
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:48.500]   actually assimilated to it yeah this is the video yeah this is the one from uh
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:52.420]   yahoo i mean i there's no other human in the car with me and i'm just and you're
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:55.940]   in the back seat so you there's nothing you could do no i mean it wasn't it was
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:39:01.700]   going tiny amounts of speed but it was amazing how quickly your brain got
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:06.500]   used to it i think really so you're going to acclimate to this this is
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.060]   something you can't wait to sit in the back seat
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:14.180]   so do you have um collision sensing on your car yeah i have all of that stuff
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.980]   yeah you've it's this is all mental the technology is there the laws are not
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:23.060]   there the mental acceptance is not there and it has to be incremental can we
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:26.180]   just go back in time when there was no phone encryption there's no self-driving
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.700]   class i just want to ride a horse that's the brilliant of the uh of the
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:33.220]   auto drive on the um on the teslas is that is the way home is that's
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:37.060]   incremental right it's not you're still driving the car theoretically but
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:41.140]   you press that button and it's driving for you but you're still in the driver
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.500]   seats like get you let's get used to that for a while and then we can sit in the
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.460]   bag really feel like that's elan's plan is he's just going to upgrade the firmware
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.420]   until it just does it yeah then eventually you'll just be having
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:55.060]   one of these drinks in the back seat and texting with gas at thirty five
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:59.220]   dollars a barrel right now um as an environmentalist i am so excited for
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.980]   acceptance of autonomous driving i prefer to have my drinks and text in the front
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:09.220]   seat well that is you have no use for what is it i can't stand useful things i can't
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:13.620]   stand usual so frank i don't know whatever his name is but yeah i think
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.820]   i think that it's going to lead to the electric car adoption and it's going to
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.940]   be people are going to be more excited for autonomous i ordered your next
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:25.940]   you can drive in it when it comes but what the whoop or not drive or the three

[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.860]   jason and i used to work somewhere that used to be on that last day yes
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:46.180]   was okay in those cases they chose that was patreon employees
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.820]   uh within the company and they would send us questionnaires
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.940]   which i remember i got one year what do they ask you
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.660]   like question about do you like it here or what the benefits like
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:59.300]   that was back when it was a little easier for a media company to get on a list
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:03.620]   like that yeah and we had stuff like a fairly
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:07.300]   cushy profit sharing plan at the time which i'm sure helped
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.900]   i'm kind of fascinated right now about the freelancer versus employee
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:14.340]   question not only more sort of really interesting article that pointed to
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:18.580]   veronica bellmont's amazing article about the issues and i'm really curious
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:22.660]   i haven't worked for a company for a long time um as an employee
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:27.460]   um i have a bizarre relationship with a bc but bottom line what do you like
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.380]   about working for a company and what do you
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:34.180]   wish you had as if you were a freelancer well incredible benefits are always
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:37.380]   nice and those are easier to get if you work for someone
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:41.300]   uh working for yourself you have way more independence typically i mean
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:44.340]   my favorite types of companies to work for are ones where i feel like i'm
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.340]   working for myself but i also get the benefits
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.060]   that's what it's like here right jace my school workers it's like working for
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:55.460]   yourself but you get the benefits exactly perfectly
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:58.340]   oh that was got the the level of authenticity
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:01.380]   because i'm so much so much so much so much so much so much so much but whatever
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.580]   you say boss you got it jay jay jay jay you just turn
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.780]   on the middle i'm deserving but because i was an employee for so many years i'm
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:12.180]   still an employee i always kind of think about running a company as
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:15.780]   an employee and try to make it something like and the number one thing is
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:19.940]   control right is like autonomy and and i i think there are a lot of people who
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:23.460]   don't want that responsibility of figuring out what they're supposed to
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.780]   do and and not somebody breathing down their
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.300]   necks but uh i don't know i try to give people that
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:32.420]   kind of situation because that's what i wanted i worked for companies where the
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:35.700]   company was an obstacle to me being creative and productive yeah you know
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.500]   what that no and that's true of a lot of companies
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.580]   tech tv was pretty good we liked working there right i don't know i was too young
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.660]   to know what was really at stake or was normal
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:48.500]   plus i didn't have kids you had kids you knew yeah i was very grateful to
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:52.900]   protect tv uh because we got a lot mostly because we got a lot of autonomy
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.340]   but then after six years of working your ass off and making a great product
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:44:00.740]   they go oh and buy thanks we sold it so yeah that's the the false security
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:03.860]   that's the negative of the whole thing is you may love it while you're there but
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.460]   there but you know well that's a friend of mine always said and he said he would
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:12.820]   never go in d like i did and he but he had to open eyes about it he said
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:17.620]   look they could lay people off tomorrow but i feel secure that i've got this job
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.300]   that i can have as long as i wanted and as long as i do what they ask of me
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:25.140]   and i don't sweat a lot of the details of working for you know making sure the
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:27.460]   company runs because other people sweat that
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:30.260]   but it is kind of an illusion i mean your company can
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:33.860]   lay everybody off tomorrow and you lose your job and
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:37.300]   you know it's just you have layers of insulation that you don't if you're
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:40.580]   working as a freelancer it takes a certain personality to live with the
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:43.620]   insecurity of being a freelancer and yet i always felt a little bit more
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.300]   secure as a freelancer because at least i made my own destiny
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:51.060]   but then you have freelancers dilemma when it's busy you got to make very well
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.980]   the sun shines and then when it's when it's quiet you're panicking because it's
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:59.540]   not busy and i'm fundamentally lazy so it really was not a good
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:03.300]   bit for me i still have a job i still i still collect a paycheck from
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:06.820]   my radio show yeah well that's the best of both worlds actually is when you have
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:10.100]   a gig that's consistent and then you can kind of
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:13.140]   go do the fun stuff you're working for yourself and is in some ways more
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.380]   secure i'd say especially in the media business
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.740]   because if you work for somebody else unless you are the boss you truly
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:21.540]   yeah don't know how all the company is doing
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:24.820]   and if you run into trouble somebody else may make decisions
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.780]   you have no control over and if you work for yourself at least you know how
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:31.220]   the company is doing if you screw up it's your fault and it's your own fault
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:35.220]   yeah we live in a golden age of media where you can also go
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:39.300]   on your own you know it's a golden age unless you're a print journalist a
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.100]   fairy said or woman over 50 that's another one it's a how old are you
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:48.820]   45 okay you got five years in tv i'm working on my writing guys
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:52.100]   that's my radio voice it's changed actually i think that's changed a lot
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:54.820]   i think there are older women now in television who are not booted out
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:57.220]   just because of their age why do you say that about print though
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:00.580]   what do you think did you read this article this is a bill moir's
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.140]   website article by dale mahar ridge what happens to journalists when no one
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:08.820]   wants to print their words anymore and it's about the
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:12.740]   huge number of print journalists newspaper journalists
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:17.300]   who are older and will never be and will never get another job they're
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:20.660]   basically it's done for you because there's no
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.260]   there aren't new newspaper jobs they just merged a bunch of the
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:27.700]   newspapers here in the bay area and a fewer newspapers that come out less
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:31.700]   often in 2007 there were 55,000 full-time journalists
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:37.140]   in fact there's a quote in here that no matter how what we do we'll always
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:40.420]   we'll never lay anybody off i think i can't remember which newspaper it was
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:43.620]   but we'll never have to we've never laid anybody off and we'll never have to
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:47.380]   there were 55,000 full-time journalists at 1400 daily papers
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:53.780]   eight years ago this year 39,000 full-time jobs and many
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.380]   of those papers have folded on that's a number from 2007
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:01.620]   i mean you go back to the numbers in 1990 right and you'll find that there
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:06.740]   even 105 newspapers closed in 2009 and what's
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:10.660]   what's sad is that many of these reporters and writers and
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:15.540]   editors are in their 50s and thought they would have a job for life and now
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:20.660]   really have nowhere to go it's a it's actually
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:25.380]   i'm it's a sad article and it's something we don't
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:30.820]   you know technology has its costs and we talk a lot about jobs people have
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:34.420]   lost and businesses that no longer exist and i imagine if you worked at Kodak
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:37.380]   you probably don't feel too good about digital photography
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:41.220]   uh but this is happening right now in journalism and in the newspaper
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:44.980]   uh there it's a terrible time to be in the newspaper business
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:49.380]   now some of those people might do as you did Jason you kind of been through
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:53.220]   this yeah but it's a it's a tiny percentage of people i i'm fortunate enough to have
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:56.020]   at least enough of an audience that i could kind of hang out my own shingle
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:58.900]   and is the key is to develop the brand and do it and a lot of
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:03.140]   newspaper reporters especially don't aren't allowed personality or a brand
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:07.460]   in public because they are supposed to be objective relayers of information
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:09.860]   you know we can argue about whether that was accurate or not but if you're a
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.660]   big-name columnist you can get away with it but if you were just somebody who was
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.100]   grinding on the on the crime beat and doing a great job at the
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:19.540]   you know at the paper in Baltimore working on the murder beat
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.540]   that that job goes away and what do you do does anybody even know who you are
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:26.580]   and if you're David Simon you can turn into writing books but
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.820]   that's a that's a bit of a crapshoot it's like uh steelworkers or something
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:33.620]   like that this is a case where you've got people who are going to have to be
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:37.220]   retrained it's really sad that i think there are jobs for a lot of
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:39.700]   these people but they're not journalism jobs right they're going to be
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.900]   corporate communications or pr or teaching or
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.420]   or uber but or yeah but it's going to require
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:50.340]   a change in in lifestyle because those uh those jobs are gone
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:53.220]   you know it's really insult to injuries people who get
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:56.500]   get laid off to get a job at uber and then of course autonomous vehicles come
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:59.220]   along with the players and there's no job there either
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:02.340]   it's like almost like there's where do you go in the new economy
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:05.940]   well have you seen cgp graze video about the rise of the robots the youtube
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.980]   video it's a great it's a great video but basically it's a real lively
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:12.500]   yeah well it's it's a it's a hilarious cgp graze this guy he makes youtube
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.660]   videos he is uh brilliant and they're very entertaining and
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:21.380]   educational videos but he made the case and it's so depressing it's basically
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:26.500]   what can't robots and computers replace us for in terms of jobs and this is
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.900]   maybe a 21st century question is what if
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:34.660]   most of the jobs we do are more efficiently done by a computer and or a
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:38.020]   robot at what at what point is there no employment
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.980]   left and what do we do then do we all just hang out or
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.180]   the big winner at the launch festival that we were talking about earlier
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:52.100]   was a robotic barista machine that i mean baristas like talk about the
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:56.020]   one of the last entry-level jobs out there
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:50:01.300]   it's going to be replaced cnets entry into fiction this week was called the
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:05.780]   last taco truck in silicon valley yes it was such a great
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:09.860]   read it was this kind of a sidebar but i just i think it's it's worth that
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:13.060]   concept of the we're really talking about a
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:17.380]   transitional economies and the speed at which this transition is happening
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:20.500]   it's a great and the real human cost of it yep
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:24.980]   if we lose the baristas if we lose the the taco restas
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:29.140]   uh who do we actually talk to you know we'll be in vr we'll be in virtual
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:33.220]   reality worlds we'll all just be sitting on our couches in vr it'll be
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:37.380]   wallie so fast if you can afford a wallie machine
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:42.660]   was a six six hundred for the the five seven ninety nine yeah
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:47.540]   but i'm glad i got mine so i'm ready i'll watch sine felden drink uh
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:52.020]   soilent okay what's the take on vr yes gonna happen big harry
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:55.860]   yes big i'd say if you're sure how long it will take you might be wrong but i
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:59.300]   don't think there's a way in which it doesn't matter at all
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:05.060]   kason big and gaming soon big in the rest of the world outside of gaming a
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:08.820]   little bit later and then i feel like there's the augmented reality stuff on
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:11.940]   top of that that could be very excited about that could be big in terms of
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:16.660]   not having to carry around a phone to get an overlay on the world i have yet
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:20.260]   to use a vr advisor without getting a little
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:23.460]   queasy and i think that that's a large portion of society you think we'll get
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.380]   over that if i'm for the longest time having no
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.740]   problem at all and then the last couple of times i used aqueous i did get a
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:31.780]   little queasy i discovered that for some reason standing up makes me lost
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:35.220]   queasy and sitting down see a technology that makes you throw up
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.980]   i think there's some problems you know there's some bugs you got to work out
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:41.780]   i think you can make the frame rate high enough and the resolution high enough
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:44.900]   and the i'd and do eye tracking and you know i you would think that you'd be
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:47.940]   able to get it in better i think that maybe there may be a barrier there you
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:50.740]   know when we saw the segue at first time we saw the segue all is gonna
[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:54.180]   revolutionize cities until people realize you look like a giant dork in
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:57.220]   it and that killed it right that was it that was a motion control
[01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:00.820]   rights like star tours make me queasy so it may just be that there's a
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:02.820]   percentage of the population that can't do it
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:07.380]   i've been a huge naysayer and i don't see the technology or the iterative sort of
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.340]   issues around this i think we can work through it but i've seen the use case
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:12.900]   kind of i'm struggling with it obviously gaming is huge
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:17.620]   porn is massive but not that massive as Donald trump says it's really big
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:22.660]   it's no he says there's no problem no problem but i love some of the
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:27.140]   really specific difference use cases i was thinking back to i went to this
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:31.460]   weird trade show about ten years ago have you used for these officers
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:35.300]   now i have so if you ever want to know i'll tell you well actually i'll bring
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:39.460]   it in for you next time you're here well tell us you should take a look at it
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:42.180]   okay i'm going to ask you quantitative questions
[01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:48.180]   ten percent better than regular porn 20 30 40 100 percent better really well
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:51.460]   at least initially because you're in it when do you ever take your eyes away
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:54.180]   from what you're looking at for anyway you can look around
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:57.220]   what are you gonna look at is it all around you yeah you're gonna look at
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:00.260]   and are you admiring the molding of the ceiling
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:02.500]   actually actually you get a pizza box that the key
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:08.500]   pizza guy brought actually yes happening yes that's true you want to see
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:11.540]   um it's not it's sometimes you go ahead and spear
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:15.860]   Leo you sometimes you go well this is a nice apartment
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:21.220]   that's interesting choice of a painting i'm not killing any left footage up
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:25.220]   man wow where's the sense that i can't see you're the one who introduced me
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:30.340]   to it i i don't deny it because he was the first one to have a visor
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:33.860]   in the in the house and he said lee oh wait a minute you want to see
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:37.140]   some and are you throwing me under the bus here
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:42.100]   yeah is it an automated bus or are you right now you can sue him isn't there
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:46.820]   some no i know it was a research project both of us were engaged in because we
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.300]   need uh this is a part of the conversation
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:51.460]   we have a new project i'll tell you what everything
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:56.500]   okay yeah sure all aspects okay so hundred percent better
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:00.820]   vhs went into beta you what you're looking for right
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:04.500]   if you're looking for decor ideas
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:09.060]   uh no it's very you know what it's uh yes it's immersive
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:12.980]   right and isn't after all what you're looking for whether it's in gaming or
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:17.140]   in video or porn you're looking for an experience that's as close to reality
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:20.820]   as possible we'll imagine something that makes you feel like you're more
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:24.180]   part of the action so we speak right okay i buy that now my other case
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:27.860]   scenario that was far more um well then what i actually
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.820]   that's kind of interesting i hadn't i really never thought about
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.780]   that it would be that much better but i don't know if this is true but it's
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:37.540]   often said that uh adult the adult industry drives technologies that
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:40.660]   online payments happen because of the adult industry that's how they say
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:44.980]   home video vhs succeeded because of and and laser disc conversely
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:48.580]   failed because they didn't have adult content so i don't know if that's true
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:51.620]   i think sometimes that's over overblown so to speak
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:54.820]   but i think that in this case there might there might be some truth in it that
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:00.020]   many people may come to it from uh you know because of adult content at least
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:02.980]   having that there is going to be an introduction for some people
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:06.020]   but more so than having the new york times sent it out with a sunday times and
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:09.060]   pictures of homeless no no don't care about that i saw a
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:12.100]   really interesting use case for pain management
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:16.900]   where burn victims were using it to distract you from their um well that's
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:20.420]   the point it's more realistic there's the one use case i went to this
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:24.260]   i said i went to this uh police and uh firearms training
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:28.900]   trade show many years ago they had a full 360 degree
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:34.980]   simulator for uh first responders in sure active shooter situation and you
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:38.900]   had to figure out which door as it opened had the mom holding the baby
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:43.140]   or the shooter with the gun right and i could see those like
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:47.780]   but training situations i mean for pilots for we're already seeing that and all
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:51.780]   the simulators VR simulation for uh for flying is actually very
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:55.220]   popular popular but it's it's happening absolutely speaking as someone who
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.860]   does a lot of conference calls i'm excited about it for
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:01.620]   collaboration that if the new studio we're building we're considering where
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:04.900]   we're going to put the 360 degree camera i would much rather see
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:08.020]   much not to rather see my colleagues in new york and
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:10.740]   be able to look around the conference table just like they can
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:13.860]   in a way that's the interesting thing it's immersive but not in the way you
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.540]   think like it's an overwhelming experience it's a more normal experience
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:20.740]   so you a lot of times you do just kind of look around you
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:24.100]   you know you just you know you're in this you're in this space
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:28.340]   so it isn't necessarily more vivid of experience it's more unnatural also
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:31.380]   it will get less ridiculous looking over time that's that's the problem at some
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:36.020]   point it will look more like eyeglasses maybe the technology will get better
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:38.740]   we talked about this last week nobody looks good when they're
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:41.380]   in a VR environment the rest of the world looks at you in that
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:46.340]   queue i love this movie movie VR situation that they had
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:50.900]   in germany last week right and they all go in they sit down in these swivel
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:53.860]   chairs they put on the VR headsets they look around the
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:56.900]   the head success and weirdly mark zuckerberg appears
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:00.340]   it's the strangest thing walking down the aisle walks down the aisle says i own
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:05.780]   you i know i think the r is both uh exciting and i think there are still
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:09.060]   some potential challenges including the nausea factor that
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:12.420]   can't be overlooked and the social aspect is never going to be overcome it's
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:16.020]   also very hard to get the social aspect remember looking like a dork was what
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:20.340]   killed the segue and google glass it doesn't demo it
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:24.740]   you have to go try it yeah you can't just look at a video on youtube and say oh
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:28.180]   i like this i want to try this you have to actually physically put on a
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.860]   dorky looking toaster it's the worst television i can't do any segments
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:36.020]   about it right right and if and like microsoft keeps
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:38.740]   showing off look at dorky these people look we're watching the
[01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:43.140]   the german group watching a movie and it just they look like talking about
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.700]   wallie yeah but there was a time when walking down the street using a cell
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.780]   phone also look really dorky and and if society wants something
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:56.020]   over time it stops looking dorky yeah i'm not saying that they will no we can
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:58.900]   overcome this but but if it's compelling enough it won't matter
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:01.860]   eventually we can make my thesis with google glass was
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.260]   though that the fundamental connection to other humans is
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:07.460]   eye to eye and when you put something between two humans
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:11.460]   that obscures that connection depends what you put between them
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:14.980]   which direction will you look at that's a little less of an issue with vr
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:19.300]   than ar ar if you're also interacting with humans
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:23.380]   who are actually are there with you that's much more of a problem i do like i
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:28.260]   do like ar i think ar has the uh uh uh opportunity to become the next
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.700]   user interface for technology mixed reality mixed reality
[01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:34.900]   yeah i like that better you know to pulse it that's the new term mixed
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:38.900]   reality oh oh mixed the fact that vr is starting out with gaming i think is
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:41.860]   generally helpful because when you're playing games
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:46.740]   you're already sort of in a unnatural context uh and you want it to be as
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:50.740]   immersive as possible and you're usually playing you know those kind of high end
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:53.780]   games by yourself at your computer anyway so
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:58.260]   yeah and gamers want any edge they can to for it to be more immersive so
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:01.620]   i think it'll be a hit there i think you're absolutely right though that
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:04.020]   what happens after that how do you get beyond
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:08.420]   those first obvious vr instances to something that everybody wants
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:13.300]   you know people didn't even want to buy 3d glasses to watch 3d tv
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:18.820]   did you see this uh quartz story about how a inkjet printer can be used to fool
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:22.420]   a fingerprint reader you can literally print i mean
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.220]   at uh mobile world congress somebody was doing it with playdoh
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:28.980]   but this is an inkjet printer uh they can actually print your fingerprint on
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:33.220]   a piece of paper and unlock a phone this is michigan state that did the research
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:38.340]   um do i talk about you know privacy problems
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:41.060]   hey let's take a break we want to talk about uh some more things we're almost
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:45.220]   done uh the the the bourbon's running out so
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:50.020]   so are we but uh first a little bit of a word about my favorite bookstore
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:53.220]   it's not a bookstore you can go into and walk around in vr yet
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.700]   although i wouldn't be surprised if someday it was
[01:59:55.700 --> 02:00:00.900]   it's a bookstore you listen to it's audible.com 180,000 titles
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:04.660]   across all types of literature fiction nonfiction periodicals even
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:08.820]   performances comedy uh i am a huge audible
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:12.580]   fan have been since those days when i had to drive two hours
[02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:16.260]   each way to tech tv that's when i first became an audible subscriber in two
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:21.380]   in the year 2000 and man i have several hundred books now my audible library
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:23.540]   it's one of the things i like about audible is that

[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:03.540]   one to recommend that's on audible it's called luna new moon by Ian mcdonald
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:07.220]   really good probably gonna be one of the best sci-fi novels
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:10.180]   uh of the year probably gonna win some awards certainly be nominated
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:14.180]   in mcdonald great writer been nominated for pugos and nebulas and stuff before
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:17.620]   and this is described it's i think it's in production to possibly be a tv
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:21.700]   series described as game of thrones on the moon oh
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:25.220]   sounds that's my two favorite things pretty great the moon and game of thrones
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:28.580]   yeah it's it's pretty great it's a fan you know it's or or
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:32.980]   you might describe it as dallas on the moon it's uh kind of family dynasties
[02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:37.140]   battling each other and uh it's a lot of fun really uh fun book
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:40.580]   i'm listening to a neil stevenson's latest which is also about the moon seven
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.420]   eaves although in this one the the book starts by the moon being destroyed
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.700]   yeah yeah that's a little more of a downer than uh luna new
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.820]   moon stays around and towards the end you get five thousand years in the
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:54.020]   future things turn around yeah yeah it's it's actually great i love

[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:30.100]   driving and not knowing you drove but you feel but
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:33.060]   what's really interesting to me is when i i don't this is happening when you're
[02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:36.100]   listening to an audible book if you re-listen to a passage you can remember
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:40.580]   where you are totally that's such a weird positional memory yeah it's a real
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:44.580]   thing it's why i run i go by certain trees i'm like oh i remember this was the
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:50.020]   part where it's so weird it's the human brain is bizarre
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.820]   um it happens to me all the time i'm listening to an audible
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:56.820]   uh passage and i'll know or yeah or vice versa you go to that place and you
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:03:01.140]   hear that passage again it's great i love audible then one of the things i like
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:03.940]   about audible is often i can't remember did i see the movie or just listen to the
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:06.500]   book because it really comes alive in your head and sometimes it's a better
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:11.060]   movie frankly than the movie it's great when you can cast any actor of any time
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:16.180]   and in any role yeah i put every story in my grandparent's farmhouse
[02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:18.900]   really oh not everyone but you know that's interesting
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:23.140]   a lot of them you place your own yeah you kind of see that place
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:28.340]   oh in trays that in Hawaii upstate new york right near wagman's
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.900]   you know that's a great place to work i hear i hear
[02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:37.060]   audible.com/twit2 your first two books are free go get them go get them
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:40.340]   well this looks good if you know people are sad because downton Abbey's wrapping
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:45.380]   up how about a book called servants at downstairs history of Britain
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:50.100]   so you could kind of hear the fact behind uh
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:53.060]   you know the great house the greatest state
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:56.020]   do you watch downton Abbey you gasped do do do do
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:00.100]   i know don't make that sound i don't know don't do it i'll make me cry
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:05.460]   that's the last it's over i know is that tonight the last one
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:08.820]   hello who's the woman who plays the dowager um
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:12.900]   Maggie Maggie she was on fresh air this week saying how much she hates it when
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:16.180]   people ask her for selfies with her or for
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:21.700]   she does of course she does yeah last episode is tonight and we won't see
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:25.300]   them again except if pbs decides to bring it back because it was such a
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:28.180]   huge money raiser British tv is always good at bringing
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:32.660]   back cast like ten years later for the christmas special right they do that
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:35.380]   all the time so i wouldn't be surprised if they do that with downton there's
[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:39.460]   money to be made if there's actors to be paid
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:42.900]   roommate Romania is not a third world nation and they would like you to know
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.860]   that apparently bernie sander's tweeted today
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:49.540]   people living in Bucharest Romania have access to much faster internet than most
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:54.260]   of the u.s that's unacceptable and must change
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:58.500]   i think he's referring to how bad our internet is yeah but folks in Bucharest
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:02.820]   did not take kindly to it Romania is sorry somebody tweeted for not being
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:06.180]   the third world country you and your voters think it is we'll be more careful
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:09.620]   next time they usually pick on Estonia for this one so i think it's interesting
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:12.980]   they've shifted to Romania Estonia is amazing it's like the
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:16.740]   wireless caria Estonia and Kazakhstan was busy with our
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:19.620]   astronauts so we couldn't pick up on pick on them
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.820]   yeah that's right that's right so Romania got it
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:27.460]   yeah europe is not chasing anymore after this trump debacle that's right
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:32.740]   they should they're rethinking their relationship with jc tweets
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:38.260]   bernie sander's give it a buco rest zing zinga
[02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:43.860]   um okay so we now know don't don't mock Romania
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:47.620]   now but watch Donald Trump will do it you know you pick almost any country any
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:50.580]   industrialized country and it's got the worst in the united states so yeah that's
[02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:53.620]   what's really the sad for wireless we're doing okay but for wired we're not in
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:55.700]   good shape yeah that's that thing i talked about
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:05:59.700]   where you're where you're uh when you invented it you have the legacy
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:03.380]   history but i'll think our our regular delivery environment kind of killed it
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.580]   to the lack of competition you mean the duopoly system
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:08.900]   yeah did not work well hey what do you think at this
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:12.420]   sorry i'm coming out of left field what do you think about all this i know i
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:15.140]   can't help myself show up please do this google
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:20.180]   exemption for radio waves in the in the desert
[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:23.300]   do you ever heard about this no all right i don't even understand what that
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:26.660]   you go on to the next story now my google is exempted for radio waves in
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.740]   the desert i'm gonna look this up because i was i see you have
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:33.060]   meerkat is uh is pivoting because uh well you can't really compete against
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:36.180]   periscope and by the way periscope's not doing all that well anyway
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:40.180]   um users who cli i saw this this got passed around on facebook and i thought
[02:06:40.180 --> 02:06:44.180]   well this is a scam users who clicked like on facebook could unwittingly be
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:50.900]   aiding online scammers huh turns out and you'd think facebook
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.780]   could be nipping this one in the bud people put up but nine posts of little
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:59.300]   kitty cats and stuff gets lots of likes and then change it
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:04.740]   to be spam oh it seems like you shouldn't be able to keep your likes if you
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:08.500]   change your post but apparently after some period
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:10.660]   i mean this is why people always ask why can't you edit
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:13.060]   twitter posts and it's the same reason is right
[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:16.980]   the it does open up abuse i i see a lot of forums where you can edit your post
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:20.420]   for like 20 minutes or something some short period of time where you've got
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:24.180]   regret where you found a typo but not have it be
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:27.780]   you know hours later after you've got a a million likes then you turn it into
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:31.300]   an ad right or worse malicious content yeah
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:35.300]   terrible members social cam yeah social camp
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:39.460]   anaconda that it's supposedly eaten someone and they took over your
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:45.380]   facebook feed we're posting really wow luckily i'm i wasn't hallucinating
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:50.420]   uh google yes has applied uh according to an fcc
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.340]   document on earth by hackaday for an experimental radio license to be
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:57.460]   built in the new mexico desert huh much redacted
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:03.860]   uh but it's it's anticipated that this has to do with google's project sky
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:07.460]   bender to bring internet by drone
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:12.260]   what can you go wrong a hundred thousand watt transmitter
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:17.460]   that's a big-ass transmitter so internet by drone but nobody lives in the uh
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:22.100]   desert uh do they right but this was i mean a lot of companies have looked at
[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:26.660]   this sort of low earth orbiting wife wireless
[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:29.460]   here are you buying any of this well facebook is also doing that they're
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:33.460]   using lasers oh much better what to go wrong use
[02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:38.020]   lasers yeah they're also doing drones and and the idea is they can go to like a
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:41.620]   little village in africa maybe it's rather distant from the existing
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:46.020]   infrastructure and just shoot down internet so and that's the google
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:49.220]   whole project uh with the balloons yes similar
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:53.060]   loon is the same idea but google is also trying drones along along with the
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:58.100]   loon balloons uh i'm one known fairly well for
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:01.540]   wasting money on kickstarter deals my most recent of course the floating
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:05.940]   bonsai tree i'm it was funded so i'm hoping to get that
[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:10.180]   but here's one that is interesting did you put this in Jason is this what you
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:14.340]   were talking about the virtuality mind-blowing anatomy
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:17.060]   adventure yes they're looking to raise a hundred thousand
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:21.060]   dollars uh for a t-shirt that lets you see
[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:27.540]   inside somebody's body what it's an educational purposes it's for
[02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:32.500]   educational purposes only yeah okay they've raised 44 000
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:36.260]   halfway there 24 days to go if you shuttle ahead in the video you'll get
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:41.220]   to the yeah shuttle ahead so uh the idea is there's
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:45.540]   something on your t-shirt like some code like an anchor point and then yeah
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:49.300]   and then you use one of these metell uh 3d
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:53.380]   things and uh virtual it's this is this is actually augmented reality isn't
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:58.020]   yeah yeah and the app is free so they want to make these
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:01.460]   t-shirts and you point the phone at somebody and you can see their
[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:06.260]   stuff i think this metell viewer is actually very cool
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:10.740]   i am so skeptical as a parent you know i'm like quasi wall dwarf with my kids
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:13.700]   they get no minecraft they're gonna sue me oh
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:18.420]   give a minecraft they can have code dot org to their hearts no no no no
[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:22.180]   you're missing the point minecraft is minecraft in fact if there's something
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:24.820]   wrong with minecraft it is really a secret attempt
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:29.780]   to teach kids you know programming and logic and building and construction
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:34.180]   it's a great tool it is the best self educational tool i've ever seen
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:37.780]   you're depriving your children that's like saying send them to vegas so they
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:41.140]   can learn math no no you don't understand i'm telling you
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:44.820]   you don't get it no you don't get it come into my server and join me
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:48.820]   and we'll build some things together it is actually i at the more i use it the
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:51.460]   more i realize that minecraft really is actually teaching you to be an
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:55.300]   engineer that's it you but this is that's a canning a bottle of tequila to
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:59.780]   an seven-year-old oh no you don't have the off button for it yet
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:03.860]   that's my biggest they don't need an off button i hate being the bad guy
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:08.500]   they can playing minecraft okay clearly we have a disadvantage
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:11.780]   glad i'm not very near right we always left behind in my own
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:17.060]   bro minecraft are you be glad be glad that they're playing minecraft and not
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:20.580]   call a duty or something like that i would agree with you on that wow the
[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:25.540]   bar is low no no no no minecraft's awesome
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:29.780]   i think it is i think i think you're missing the point of mine i i i do agree
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:32.420]   that i'm a little bit um prescriptive but
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:37.700]   do you let them play with legos oh totally minecraft's like better legos
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:40.260]   except it's two dimensions and there are no
[02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:43.700]   two dimensions you think there's plenty of other humans
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:47.460]   yeah that's the beauty of it is it's uh it's your kids and their friends playing
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:50.900]   together in a 3d collaborative space it's pretty awesome it's actually the
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.140]   it's preparing them for their future world when they are flipping burgers in
[02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:59.380]   20 years i'm gonna owe you a bottle of the robots
