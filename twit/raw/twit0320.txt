[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960]   Joining us from CNN, Mark Millian.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.160]   Great to have you back, Mark.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   Good to be here in the beautiful studio.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   Yeah, it's your second time here.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.080]   You're no newbie to the studio.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.200]   We're glad to have you back.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.680]   Also joining us to my right, beautiful,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560]   Shirla Zar of What's Trending.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.120]   Thank you.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.920]   What's trending.com.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.120]   It's good to have you back.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960]   It's so exciting.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.760]   I've been on it so long.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.000]   It has-- well, you came on.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.520]   That's a great name.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.600]   I'll tell you when you were on last.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.400]   When you were launching, what's trending?
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.680]   Oh my god, the day before.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.440]   The day before.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.000]   I totally remember.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   We're so excited about that.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.160]   I was very excited.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.920]   We still am.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.320]   We're continuing the show.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.440]   Yeah, we should mention.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.240]   I mean, unfortunately, there was an unfortunate incident.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.040]   A tweet went out from the newsroom, not your tweet.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.120]   And it was a little--
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.840]   it was a mistake.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.440]   CBS, unfortunately, I think, decided, well,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.520]   we're going to cut you loose because we don't want--
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.320]   well, NBC killed you by publishing that CBS had said it.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.920]   I think a lot--
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.160]   Well, I think--
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.720]   There's the British papers.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.200]   Other ones have played a way out.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440]   Chauncee de Vorac is also here.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040]   No, listen, it was an unfortunate situation.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   You're never going to relationships expecting that.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.800]   We're hard workers.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.960]   We really take pride in what we do.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.440]   But the good news is disrupt media, which is your company.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.200]   You own--
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.120]   Yeah, we own everything.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.880]   So it's the new model.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.560]   I think back in the day, something like that would happen.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.400]   You'd be off the air.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.280]   You're just cut.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160]   And we're continuing.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.600]   And you know, you stream and livestream our great partners.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   I agree with you.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.960]   And they drive a lot of views to us.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.200]   And we've built a community.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.080]   So it's like, once you have a community,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.200]   there's no stopping you.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.160]   Well, the other thing--
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.200]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.000]   I mean, that's what keeps us alive as a community.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.080]   But the other thing you're doing is you're getting great bookings.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.360]   You're in LA, and you have really--
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.320]   Oh, yeah, muslin with the bookings.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.880]   Yes, I actually have a side job booking.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   What I bet you do.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.400]   No, I'm--
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.360]   It's a full-time gig.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   It's a full-time gig.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.880]   And I do with my other executive producer,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.000]   all of the booking, we do it.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.560]   And this Tuesday's show, we have Snoop Dogg coming on.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.920]   OK.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   I rest my kids.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.480]   Snoop Dogg.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.640]   And his daughter is performing on the show, which is--
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.680]   What about Snoop Dogg?
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.280]   Make him for him.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.400]   Snoop Dogg will be introducing her.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.960]   We also have Mark from Boing Boing, the founder Boing Boing.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.280]   Mark Fromfellow is great.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.920]   And Romany Maka, who's a comedian.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.040]   So we just keep getting great people.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.160]   People really support it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.840]   It's kind of for the digital hip--
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.520]   It's the talk show for the digital age.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   Like Merv Griffin for hipsters.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.440]   And hopefully, you're going to be on with your in LA.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.120]   If you weren't so far away.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.400]   And it's what's trending.com.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   What day could people watch live?
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.440]   Tuesdays, 10 a.m. Pacific Time, 1 p.m. Eastern,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.480]   what's trending.com.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.400]   And we're live stream.com/what's trending.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.880]   You know what you did?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.720]   You were so smart.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.480]   That's what's trending.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.920]   You know what?
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.240]   You did something very smart.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.400]   You don't compete with me.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.840]   I don't have anything live at 10 a.m.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.440]   Oh, really?
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.000]   You know it?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.480]   No.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.160]   We started 11.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.720]   So maybe we should do a partnership, a syndication
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.200]   partnership.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   I think you're going to be working for each other shortly.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.880]   I'll do a deal with you.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   Maybe.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.440]   We can-- yeah.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.880]   We should talk.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.600]   We're one way or another.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.160]   What do you think, guys? Audience?
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.840]   Yay.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.960]   Also, you're John C. Devorek. channeldevorek.com.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.520]   And he's dressed as the tech grouch today.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.320]   That really isn't much of a costume.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.560]   Tech grouch wears blue.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   And only blue.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.800]   Oh, everyone's eggs.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.120]   Sure.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.280]   John, you just came back from where Brazil?
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.400]   Wow.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.360]   How was that?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.040]   Very Brazilian.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   Bring me some konsacha.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   Konsacha?
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   I travel.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.600]   I don't check luggage, so I couldn't bring anything back,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.320]   actually.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.240]   You drank it all.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.920]   That's what happened.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.600]   Well, there's a lot of it down there.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   What is it?
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   Caparilla?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   Caparilla?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Caparilla?
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   It's good.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   It's OK.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   I have one when I was in the sun.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   They're very sweet.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   It's like egg in them?
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   Yoke?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   Oh, no.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Caparilla is no.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   That's another--
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   It's just sugar and lime.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   It's like a mojito.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   The mojito of Brazil.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   I didn't go there for the drinking, by the way.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   What'd you go there for?
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   I gave a speech at this.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   There's actually a very big conference down there.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   There's actually massive called a future comm.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.200]   And a future comm-- everybody was there.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.160]   I mean, there wasn't one company you could think of that you'd normally see it like a
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.600]   comm back or something that wasn't there.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   It was huge.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   Was everyone posting updates on Orcutt?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   You know, it's funny.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.200]   I broke that joke up there.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   I brought up to a couple of times and I've had more than a few Brazilians say, you know,
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   what you said about Orcutt is not quite true.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   It's true they switched over to Facebook.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.520]   I just saw a stance that Orcutt is now way second to Facebook.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   Well, I told them, don't worry.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.200]   You've got Orcutt 2 coming your way called Google+, maybe.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   And that'll fail the negative on Google.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   And I see Shir and I, you're a big Google+ user.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   I can see that.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   Right here.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Leola Port.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   Twitter's live with John, C.D. of Orcutt, Cheryl Azar, and it's gone on the Google+,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   it's been came coming in.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   I love Google+.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   Yeah, I know you do.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   You don't like it.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   It's fine.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   But it's not the social network that Facebook is.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   Facebook is really--
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   Well, that's a bit more mainstream.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   And it's done by guys who are freaky about social networks.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   Google guys would not even want to-- you know, try to get--
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   Let's talk as a story, the big story of the week, obviously.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Besides the return of Meg Whitman to Silicon Valley, the big story is Facebook redesign.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   They launched a number of products or new site features before F8.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   And on Thursday announced considerably more.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   It is a very different Facebook.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.800]   And I'll tell you what, I'll pose you the panel, the question I posed on the radio show
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   earlier today.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.200]   It seems to me-- you know, we talk a lot about tech companies making a pivot.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   You know, ODO, Ed Williams made a huge pivot from a podcast company to Twitter.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   Flickr was a gaming company before they became a photo sharing company.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   These pivots are not unusual in the tech industry.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   But they almost always come because-- in fact, as far as I know, they always come because
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   you failed in the first product.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   And so you say, well, what else can we do?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   We've got money.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   We've got a team.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   What else can we do?
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   This is the first time I can think of that you have a wildly successful site.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   A site that, you know, 750 million active users.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   In fact, Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that they had a half billion user day.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   Amazing.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   500 million uniques in one day.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   There's no website even close.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   That's an amazing number.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   And they pivoted.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   They went from being a site that was essentially a private place where you and your friends
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   would gather and you would show them pictures and they'd show you pictures and tell you what they're up to.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   All I can think is Twitter envy to a public site.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   Is this not a pivot, Mark?
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   Well, I use it that way now since you're talking about the--
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   We're probably the wrong people to talk to because we're all public.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   Yeah, we're all public.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   But I have to think of my mom and my sister and my friends who use it as--
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   And they don't even know that that's subscribed button.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   They don't want subscriptions.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   They don't want-- but everything in here is going public with the timeline, with the profiles.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   Isn't that where it's going?
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   No, I don't think so.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   I think they're--
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   I think you could still use Facebook as a use to use it as a completely private site.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   Keep it aside.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   In a way.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   I think it's harder to do now because a lot of things they'll turn on the public automatically.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Public automatically.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   But I think they're trying to make it slightly more clear where when you post a status update, it says at the bottom,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   "This is going to be public," or you can switch it to just your friends or close friends.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   But I think they're also-- it's not a complete pivot, but they're trying to appease people like us,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   people who are using Twitter or using Google+ and pumping up those networks because they're very robust public features.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   So--
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   So I compete at every company, it feels like they're now becoming a search engine in many ways because everything's going to be public.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   You can search for stories or reactions.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   And as a reporter, I do that all the time.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   And they're also becoming Amazon and they're becoming Netflix and they're becoming every company out there.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   They're just trying to own it so that becomes your way up.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   So what is motivating this?
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   I mean, wouldn't you--
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   Well, don't nation.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   If you had 750 million users, 500 million uniques in one day, you're selling plenty of ads, you're doing plenty well.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Why would you change it and risk confusing and chasing away a less sophisticated audience?
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   Unless I see evidence that anyone's bailing out.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   Well, there's nowhere to go.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   Well, there you have it.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   They can do everything you want.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   I don't think we were plus.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   The problem is Google+ is this.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   And also--
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   No, Google+ is public though.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   That's the point.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   My mom is going to use Google+.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   Like, it's just the interface isn't as easy.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   There's nowhere for your mom to go, is there?
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   My mom would go on Facebook, if anything.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   Oh, she's not on Facebook.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   She's not on Facebook.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   I don't want to say it.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   But she follows me like a stalker on Twitter.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   No, but she's a web site.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   You pick somebody in your family or friends who's non-sufficient.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   My dad's on Twitter.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   He's not sophisticated.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   Oh, that's okay.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   All right, so that's not sophisticated.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   Well, just Google+ is just too hard.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   Like, you're going to pick some people to post to this group, to that group.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   Well, if Google+ is hard, Facebook is a master's degree.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   Well, now it's a bit too much.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   Complexity.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   There's too many options.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   Like, you have what the lightweight, then you have the other-- what was the ticker, and
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   then you have this, that.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   It's like too much.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   You end up--
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   And there's--
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   You'll just want to post it publicly.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   It's friction-free sharing, which other people might call BLAH on the internet.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   Where you just-- if I'd watch, if I'd listen to a song on Spotify, that song will be played.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   I mean, let me go to a spot.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   Like, how you said "Seren Dippitus Discovery."
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   Like, it made it really--
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   Yeah, it's not serendipitous.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   It's not serendipitous.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   It ain't-- there's no serendipity.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   If I listen to a song-- and now, by the way, I set this up, but it's very easy to forget that
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   you set it up or not notice when you set it up, that you were giving permission for-- and
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   that's the thing to look for.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   I'm going to listen to you and I, the metronomy remix.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   And right away, it posts your Facebook immediately.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   Now, let's go to my Facebook and see, because I'm going to go to my Facebook profile.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   And let's see if it's posted already to Facebook.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   Leo, listen to you and I, metronomy--
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   Weird.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   You can turn that off.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   No, I know I can, but the point--
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   What are you complaining about?
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   I wish I could turn Lady Gaga off.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   Thank you.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   The point is, people do this, they forget they did it, they don't look at the preferences.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   You're actually giving--
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   And they probably don't care that much about their privacy in any real sense.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   So you think it's okay to do this?
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   Really?
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   It's not not care.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   I think you forget that you need to care.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   I think we're just becoming used to it.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   Get off this book if you feel that way.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   No, I'm not saying me.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   I just say the regular person.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   But that's where the pivot comes in.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   We're creating an acceptance.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   No pivot involved.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   That's where the pivot comes in.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.700]   If you got on Facebook because you thought this was a private place, you could tell people
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   you're engaged.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.200]   You're incredibly stupid and naive.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   Even back then.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   Two years ago.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.280]   Well, that's who you've said this before.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280]   I'm just quoting you.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.640]   What I have said is, if you post anything on the internet, you should assume it is public
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.200]   or will be public at some point.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   Exactly.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   Because it's very hard to stop that.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.240]   Yeah, it's like putting a blog post up or even a tweet that you want to pull back.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.400]   Well, who's that somebody did some tweet recently and then they erased it, but they still got
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   no kinds of trouble?
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   Not you.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   Well, that's--
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   Well, that's--
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   --that too.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   There was another one.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   There's the other one.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   Yeah, it was actually a Facebook employee who said how much he liked the new streaming media
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.720]   features of Facebook and his friends could fall on.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   And then he realized, oh my god, we haven't released that yet.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   And he turned it off.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Well, that happens all the time.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   It happens all the time.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   But, OK.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   I guess I'm--
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   I'm not going to buy into this.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   I'm not going to buy into this.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   I'm just going to get to the root of this here.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.960]   You actually have a deep-seated hatred.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.720]   Let's not make this a personal job.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.040]   I'm just trying to-- I'm only making it-- I'm not making it personal.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   I'm giving people an evaluative--
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.200]   Speaking of metal magic.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   --a dimension where they can kind of pinpoint where you're coming from so they can-- so they
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   can more honestly evaluate your thoughts on the matter, which are incredibly bigoted.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   I am an objective technology journalist expressing--
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   Why did you become a technology journalist you keep promoting?
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   It was your fault.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   You made me a technology journalist.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.640]   I was a lowly talk show host when you met me.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   You're a mogul.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   Why did you just drop the journalist?
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   I'm not a mogul.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   I am not a mogul.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.400]   I had to build this only so that I could talk incessantly to no purpose.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.640]   So my point is-- and I'm going to say one more time in there--
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   --very diller a journalist.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   It's not the same.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.640]   That's a pretty big title, very good.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.440]   Eileen, would you have the jet ready because I've had enough of this and I am going to
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.640]   Cabo for the weekend.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   Okay.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   Okay, so none of you buy this idea that Facebook has made a major and highly risky change.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   Oh no, I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.640]   Thank you.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   There you go.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   That's what he was waiting for.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.880]   I've been following this for a couple months and I was just really curious how they would
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.640]   end up implementing it because they've made it clear for a long time and talks with Spotify.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.800]   Initially, there was talk that this might be just a Spotify, Facebook collaboration,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.840]   and then they hugely broadened it over the last few months.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.480]   And it was obvious that they were going to bring this idea of scroubling from last FM
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.160]   to music.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.240]   But bringing that to video is a little weird.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.880]   Lasting everything you watch on Netflix is a little weird.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.000]   You can't, now this is interesting because you can't yet not that US because there happens
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.920]   to be a privacy law in the United States, the Video Rental Privacy Act or something like
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.680]   that, the video that was created because Robert Bork, when he was, remember he got
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   Borked?
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.560]   I don't know this, this is what you're telling me.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.760]   Yeah, so when Robert Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court, he was a, was he a Bush,
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.440]   the first nominee or Reagan, I think it was a Reagan nominee.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440]   And Nixon.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   And no, it wasn't.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   I think it was Reagan.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   In any event, one of the ways they got Bork thrown out was by going to the video rental
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.200]   store and getting his history of video rentals.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.640]   That prompted the Republican Congress that was very incensed about this to create a bill,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:57.800]   not a bad bill, the Video Privacy Protection Act that says a video store cannot reveal.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.880]   Since been blown away by the Patriot Act, I'm sure.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   No, it hasn't.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.200]   You're a, okay, you're right, if you're the FBI, you could go in and ask for it.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.480]   But normally a video store cannot publish your video rental history.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.400]   This is what Netflix is running up against.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.360]   Spotify, it's not illegal to show your music, but it is illegal currently for Netflix to
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.680]   tell Facebook what you're watching.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.800]   And there was Reed Hastings, a Facebook board member up on stage using that as a political
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.920]   platform to lobby for, he said it was an antiquated law.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.600]   And in fact, he's managed to get some tame members of Congress to introduce a bill in
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:36.240]   the house to change the video Privacy Protection Act so that Netflix can post this stuff.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:42.760]   Now on the one hand, I think if you willingly volunteer to have, I mean, I post all my music.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760]   I would post all my Netflix stuff.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   But you decide it's not like that happens automatically.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.320]   And then what if one day you just decide to click on something you watch by mistake,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.960]   you could even rent by mistake, you click on to watch a porn.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.760]   Well, this is going to be automatically go.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Absolutely.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   This is going to be the more.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.280]   It's going to cause more divorces, lawsuits, murders, murders.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   Wow.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   That's the same.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   Boy, you're getting carried away.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.040]   Well, so even beyond that, even beyond the video, which is weird, there's, there's,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.160]   you know, a bridge between music and video.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   Maybe it's not that we're in to scrabble everything you watch, even though you may.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.560]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.520]   News is a little weird.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.760]   Every article you click on on Yahoo news, every, every link someone sends you, you click
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   through from my head.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.920]   It's not an automatic thing where just anything you read.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.440]   What if you're cyber stalking someone and you just happen to be looking them up all
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   the time.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.880]   So now it like appears every time you go to an article, this is the Stalker's Right
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   Protection Act.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   Exactly what this.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.240]   And Dave Weiner wrote a very, I thought a very good insightful article in which he
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.760]   said Facebook is scaring me for that very reason.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.880]   Now again, Mark Zuckerberg will point out as, as will everybody at Facebook.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.880]   No, no, no.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.960]   In fact, there was a response to Weiner's post, which said exactly that.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   No, no, no.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.480]   You're giving permission.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.080]   You're saying it's okay.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.520]   When you go to the new Washington Post social media feed, Washington Post is doing this,
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.200]   not just Washington Post articles, but yours and everybody else's articles.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.640]   When you go there and say, yes, I give you permission to post as me on Facebook, you're
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   saying forever.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.520]   Until I, until I tell you not to.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.040]   You're saying until I promise people forget and people don't know they did it.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.080]   They're not, my mom might not be clear on what she's giving permission to.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.000]   And it's not even the same with every service that you use.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.800]   I was talking to Flipboard at this event.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.960]   They're listed up there as a launch partner.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   They'll be, you know, connect your Facebook to us, but they chose not to post every story
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   to Facebook because they didn't agree with it.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.680]   We already have so much noise.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.080]   Imagine if everything we did was posted.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.680]   Well, but this is where I kind of like what Facebook's done.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   I think that they've actually now, okay, I'm gonna say the positive stuff.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.280]   For people like you and me who want to live in public, I think this is great.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.240]   In fact, I'm even thinking maybe we should move from Google plus because they've got
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.760]   this great ticker that goes by on the right.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.040]   If you say, oh, Robert Scobble just listened to something by Janelle Monet on Spotify, I
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.200]   can highlight it.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.560]   I can literally press this button and listen along with him.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   That song is now playing.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.040]   It makes me wonder why he's listening to Big Boy, but that's...
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040]   Not the thing.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   It's like, what if...
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   That it's like...
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   Scobble's listening.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.640]   Okay, or, but presumably you follow people on Facebook.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.720]   So listen to their music?
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   No.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.840]   Well, no, I take it back.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.720]   I think you're wrong, John.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.120]   You're way too old to do that.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   But I think that they're...
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   You're right.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   I think really...
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.880]   I think that in fact this is what the young people today do, right?
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.880]   The youngins.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   The youngins.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.120]   And look here, Frederick Van Johnson says he likes this nonprofit organization.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.960]   This is great for this nonprofit organization.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.440]   That is sharing that ability to connect.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.120]   I make click this like button.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   It's more accessible.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   Exactly.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   And it just makes it easier.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.600]   The whole thing about the internet is you need to make it easy.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.800]   They've done a good job of making this unobtrusive.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.320]   So I still have, in fact, they're doing a lot of work.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.680]   John, you're like a chimpanzee.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   Huh?
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.240]   He's really excited about this cyber cup holder.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   About this future?
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240]   I'm used to this.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   Future what?
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   Chimpanzees?
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   Yes.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.000]   So, just don't let John know that I have a sound effects board on my iPad and I'll never
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.480]   hear the end of it.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.040]   Anyway, I think that they've done a good job of managing what could be a very complex
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.600]   interface.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.040]   I think the real issue is here is that Facebook has gone from private to public facing very,
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.320]   very clearly.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.800]   It is a pivot.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.400]   I can't understand the pivot because they're doing fine financially.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.000]   I think it's Twitter envy on the part of my side.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And you have everything.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   It's Google and media.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.560]   You know, there's also the possibility, which I know you, since you really dislike the entire
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.560]   organization.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.800]   I think there's the possibility that they're doing like Adobe.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.080]   They're just running as fast as they can and then just assuming somebody's going to be
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.600]   sneaking up behind them and they're not going to be like, you know, there's two ways of
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   dealing with the future with these companies.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.200]   Microsoft's one way, which is you get something up there, you kind of get into a monopoly
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.080]   position and then you sit on it and do nothing and just make money while everybody sneaks
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   up on you.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.800]   Or Adobe, if you take a look at Photoshop Illustrator, CS55 and all the rest of this
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   stuff.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.400]   These guys are every year and a half, Photoshop, you got to like, you got to go back to school
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.600]   to get it to catch up again.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.680]   And they just never, nobody's chasing.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.960]   I mean, you know, they're way ahead.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.840]   You think that they've got the Andy Grove, only the paranoid survive mentality?
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   He's Jewish.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.400]   So he is neurotic, you know.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   He's neurotic.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   You're Jewish too, right?
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.040]   I just want to make sure more than you're I, don't you think?
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:42.200]   I moderated this, this ad brand social media thing at social media week in LA.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.360]   And it's funny because I think brands have just gotten used to in accepting, you know,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.080]   Facebook pages and fans and figuring out how to use the likes to their advantage.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.120]   And now it's like they need to go back and reintroduce it to all the companies because
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.480]   now it's like, how do we use Facebook?
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.880]   It's a whole new way to use Facebook now.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.160]   Well, that's a very good example.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.560]   For instance, if you are an individual, you're not supposed to have a page anymore.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.760]   You're supposed to use your Facebook profile and have people subscribe to it.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.720]   The brand, how are they going to?
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.280]   Well, the brands are only pages.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   They're only pages.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   Can you have separate pages?
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.640]   But they don't want you as a public figure to have a page.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.640]   They want you to subscribe.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.080]   They want you to have subscribers, right?
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.240]   Have you gone to subscribe?
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.240]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.800]   I think for someone like you.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.240]   I'm told Facebook reached out to you.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.680]   I'm sure they reached out to you.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.360]   They said, I want you to transfer your fan page to subscriptions.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   They told you that?
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   And they're like, we really recommend that.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   I was like, are you sure?
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   Are you sure?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.960]   They always email me things like tips, like how I should be engaging.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   Really?
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   Yeah, because I have friends there.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   And so they said to me like--
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.760]   Nothing ever tell me anything.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   I haven't gotten anything from them.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.160]   Well, I don't have an account.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   Well, no, they'll--
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160]   Of course you don't.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   I used to connect my Twitter to my Facebook.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   I used to connect my Twitter to my Facebook.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.560]   They didn't like-- I don't think they liked that.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.240]   And so they kept on saying you really shouldn't connect the two because you're not getting as
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   much engagement.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.160]   We really recommend that if you want to get more engagement, you should--
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.760]   You should put it separately on Facebook.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   And so I started doing that.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.960]   And actually, my subscribers went up 2000 this week.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   Wow.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   But supposedly--
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   On Facebook.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.360]   Did that result in checks in the mail?
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   Of soon.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   Yes.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   It is.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   It checks.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   Like giant ones.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.560]   So Facebook made a list of-- if I could find it, I can't anymore-- of journalists.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.360]   Oh, maybe it was Google plus.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   No, it was Facebook.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   I was Facebook.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.360]   And I asked him why I was honest.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   You're on that list.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   I wasn't honest.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   I got mad.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   I'm not on the list.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360]   I've been doing this for 30 years.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   What's up with that?
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   No, wait a minute.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   They can't subscribe to you.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   You don't have a Facebook account.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   That's why you're not on the list.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   So what?
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360]   But you are on the list.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   Yeah, I wasn't.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   I was.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   Because I was just big at it.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   I was just big at it.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   I have a Facebook account.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   I have a Facebook page.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   Twitter is a--
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   You're on the mogul.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360]   You're on the mogul section.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   Go look under M.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.360]   The video.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   You tell me if this is something that excites you or scares you.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   This is from facebook.com/timelines.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   By the way, if you go to the beginning of your timeline, they ask you for a baby picture.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   I also-- I hide my birth year on Facebook.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   But they know.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   They know.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   They know.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   They know.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   So there's still kinks that you worked out.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   This is the front for the CIA.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   Let's face.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   We do know that CIA is an investor.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   I think the CIA is doing their part.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   So this is a pitch to do what?
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   Create this page?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   No, it's automatically created for you.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   To use this page, how would you use it?
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   You're the only one who sees this page.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   Everybody looks up--
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   Eventually everybody.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   Everybody looks up Mark Millian will see your timeline.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   No.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   Only friends of yours can see--
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.360]   Oh, it's not public.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   Right.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   Parts of it are--
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   It could be a pretty pregnant thing to get you in.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   Yep, what part's public?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   It's the same sort of stuff that's public now with your Facebook profile.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   So you decide as you create this timeline,
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   whether to make this stuff public.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   You actually have one.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   If I go to--
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   If I go to--
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   If I go to--
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   If I haven't been able to get one yet--
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   If I go to Facebook.com/--
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.360]   No, you need to have one turned on for yourself in order to see other people's.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   Oh, so I don't get to see it.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   Right.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   Somebody turned my mic up.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   Somebody's--
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   No, you're plenty loud enough.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   We do that on purpose, John.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   Aww.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   Besides the timeline, they're going to change how your profile looks.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   You'll have a cover on it now, which is kind of like about.me.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.360]   It's a big picture.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.360]   It's like a WordPress, the classic WordPress design.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.360]   They're also taking over Tumblr.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   They're taking over every side.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360]   They're like, "Just don't go on Tumblr.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   Don't go on WordPress."
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.360]   Well, timeline replaces Tumblr.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.360]   The activity stream replaces Twitter.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360]   You're right.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   They're going after everybody.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.360]   This is what they call stories.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   Share and highlight your most memorable posts.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   Are these public by default, or is it how your settings are?
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   Yeah, it's typically not by default.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.360]   I don't think they're pushing everyone to go public.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   I think they're pushing everyone to publish more to people that they're connected with,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   to overshare with people that they include in their personal circle.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.360]   How's it ever been a vanity site that used to be a kind of a--
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   Because it's created automatically by everything you've added to Facebook.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   But this is what's weird about it.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   You're right.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   It's not automatically public.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   And yet, don't you think if you have this great looking timeline,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   there is some incentive to say, "Gee, what do I need a blog for?
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   Let me just post public, publish this public."
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   They're trying to kill the blogs.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   Yeah, but most people don't want blogs.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   Okay.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   It is automatic.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   I love someone said that there should be a Bachelor in Facebook.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   Bachelor's degree.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   You need a-- I'll be honest.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   I think you need a college education to use this thing.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.360]   And then you--
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   At the time we bail out.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   Of what?
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   Facebook?
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   I would love to kill my Facebook.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   You killed it once already.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360]   I did.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.360]   And I can't cover it.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   Don't you think this is an important story to cover?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   How do you cover Facebook without Facebook?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   I don't.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.360]   I never write about Facebook.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   Oh, there you go.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   I have to.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   Why should I?
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.360]   Don't you think I have to?
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   It's not got nothing to do with computers, to be honest about it.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   It's a game.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   You only do things that have to do with computers?
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   Or politics, depending on what I'm writing about.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   But politics, Facebook and politics come together and converge all the time.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   Politicians are using Facebook, campaign.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   Yeah, yeah, they're much, yeah.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   So what?
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   What do you think of this new guy, Johnson?
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   Johnson.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.600]   You like him?
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   What new guy, Johnson?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   The New Republican.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.800]   He's an old Republican that just barely got into the thing and had one punchline written
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   for him.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.280]   And he had to read off the Gary Johnson.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   He had to read off the piece of--
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.760]   Governor of New Mexico to term Governor of New Mexico.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.480]   He's actually a really interesting person.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   I agree.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   He's very boring.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.600]   Actually, John, a quick search shows that you covered Facebook in January saying--
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   Oh!
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.360]   --just why I don't use Facebook.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   I'm very list.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   Comparing it to AOL.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   I like that one.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   Yes, I called Facebook the next AOL.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   I did.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.440]   And I'm getting credit for that because it's exactly what it is.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   It has all the earmarks of AOL.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.200]   It's going to have the same grizzly deck.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.560]   It feels like AOL, doesn't it?
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   Yeah, totally feels like AOL.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.720]   OK, I'm on total agreement with you now.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.880]   John writes, Facebook is basically AOL with a different layout and all the same retro
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   problems.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   Exactly right.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.520]   By the way, this guy, Gary Johnson, very effectively using Google+, he just did a hangout
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   on Google+.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   Wow.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.920]   And you know who else is using Google+, and hangouts?
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   Is it Rick Perry?
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   Who else has had a hangout?
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Rick Perry.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   I am.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   He doesn't even know how to use a computer.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   No, I'm talking politicians now.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   Will I am?
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   It's not a politician?
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   Maybe he is.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   He's never known.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   The piece, the piece part.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   How about--
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   How do you use hangouts, by the way?
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   I've used them a little bit.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   I want to use these--
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.120]   Explain hangouts to the listening public.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.080]   It's a video chatroom with nine people, but they have now added the ability to make
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.440]   it public so that even if you're not one of the nine that was able to get in, like
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.840]   the minute the hangout started, you can watch the hangout, which means people like Gary,
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.480]   Rod and Paul and others can actually have candidates' forums invite nine people in
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.080]   there, answer questions, and people can watch this thing.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.320]   We could use it to stream this show.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.880]   I think we should.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   I think I will.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.280]   We're trying to figure out how to use this.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   I think this is--
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.920]   You know what I love?
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.720]   To step back a little bit, at least I love it that there's this great competition now
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.680]   between Google and Facebook to create more useful, better social sites.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.800]   And I think we're seeing some innovation as a result of that.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   Yeah, that's always been the executive's excuses whenever they copy another service's feature.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   It is an competition.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.760]   It's competition makes everybody better.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.400]   And it's actually true.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.000]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   We've got Mark Millian from CNN.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Always great to have him.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.680]   Shira Lazar from what's trending.com.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   So nice to see you.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   It's fun to see you.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   We should talk about a syndication deal.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   You do like that?
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.280]   Hey, I want to find your secrets for a question.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   I think you're right.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   And of course, John C. DeVoir finders for you.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.200]   Who might have asked-- and I don't know if I should say this publicly because you could
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   say no.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.320]   It's just a little bit like a marriage proposal in public.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   John--
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   Leo, I don't go there.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.280]   Good talk to Adam.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.240]   You know, you and I have been close personal friends for many years.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.000]   No, I want to get you back on Twitter on a regular basis.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.480]   I think Twitter without John is like--
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   You bring her on more often than you and your--
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   It's like a kiss without a mustache.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   And a tail come on.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.160]   It's like fish without a bicycle.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   I just need a jet.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   It's like this with a mustache.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   Like this with a mustache.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.640]   It's kind of disgusting.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   We'll get you a jet.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   I know, I need a jet so I could be here, you know.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   On her G4.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.200]   She do probably do well with a beach.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.440]   This show brought to you by our friends at Citrix, creators of the great Go To My
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   PC.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.640]   I don't know if you remember, but last week we had an iPad 2 giveaway.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.400]   I'm going to tell you the winner in our iPad 2 giveaway in just a moment.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.040]   You know we are a nation on the go and go to my PC from Citrix.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.040]   Really is a great way to keep working no matter where you are.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.840]   I know you might say, "Well, why would I want to do that, Leo?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   I'm on vacation."
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.080]   I can think of a lot of reasons.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.320]   Clear that inbox before you get back.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.080]   Maybe you left that PowerPoint slide somewhere.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.400]   Maybe you just like to go home, sit by the pool, and still get a little work done.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.120]   That's what Go To My PC can do for you.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.680]   Access your Mac or your PC, your office computer.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:10.240]   Could be your home computer from anywhere, anytime on a Mac, a PC, or even, yes, on an
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   iPad.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   That is pretty cool.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.800]   You carry around this little lightweight iPad, and you've got everything that you have at
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.400]   work available to you.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   You can log in.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   You can send and receive email.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.480]   You can access any network resource.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.320]   You can run any program just as if you were on a Windows PC or a Macintosh with Go To My
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.960]   PC for the iPad.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.560]   I think that is awfully cool.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.040]   This program is free.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   The iPad program is free.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.880]   You can use Go To My PC free for the next 30 days.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:42.640]   If you visit GoToMyPC.com, click the try at free button and enter our offer code TWIT.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:49.000]   Go to MyPC.com, enter the offer code TWIT and now, drum roll please.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.440]   We asked you to tweet out last week what types of files or programs you'd like to use with
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.680]   Go To My PC and an iPad 2.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   We got over 2,000 tweets since then.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.080]   Jason Hart said Excel and Hulu.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   That's interesting.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   It's fast enough to do that.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.600]   Kyle Diedrich said Photoshop or Illustrator, Eric Levan, Microsoft Office on the Go.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.200]   Dave Nelson wants to use Sony Vegas video editing on his iPad.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.760]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.520]   I don't know if you could do that.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.000]   Quicken George Greslax.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Stren said one note.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.600]   Well, it goes on and on and on.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.560]   But our winner of a brand new iPad said if I had an iPad, I'd use it to access my work
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:37.280]   computer from vacation during quote emergencies only I can fix, Chris Dub at KRISDUB.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.280]   Congratulations.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.600]   You've got a new iPad 2 compliments of Citrix at Go To My PC.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.480]   We will be in touch with you at KRISDUB.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.880]   Congratulations and thanks to everyone in our audience who have participated.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.400]   Thanks to Citrix who have been a great sponsor all along for this program and of course,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   make great products.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   Go to MyPC.com.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.000]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   John C. Devorak's back.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.240]   He's got a bottle of his favorite refresher.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   Oh my God.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   What is going on?
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   John.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   Everything was so good.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.720]   There's such a bad influence.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Fashion all.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.880]   I just like to point out the last time you were in studio with us, it was John.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   And with Lisa Bettany.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   And Lisa Bettany.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.360]   And what did John do?
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.120]   He just, he applied you with liquor.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.920]   Yes, he brought up the bottles.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.400]   And I think he, didn't he give you a ride home later?
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.320]   I don't know what he was saying.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   Somebody gave you a ride home.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   Someone, I got a left home.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   Someone gave you a ride home.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.560]   And said, man, that's sure it was wasted.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.880]   That was in my young years.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   And much more responsible than that.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.880]   You were younger and irresponsible.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.960]   But now he's pouring, apparently wine wasn't enough.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   He's pouring Yeager.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   Oh my God.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   Don't drink that.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   What am I at high school?
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   Don't drink that high school.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   But you know what?
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.760]   In Montreal, he can drink a gauge.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   That's right.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   It's true.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   16?
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.760]   18.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   You got any gold schlockers?
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   High school called pre-colors.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   It's your collection.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.600]   We actually have, did you see there's two bottles of Yeager in the freezer?
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.200]   Was something different about the other one?
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.400]   No, it's a tradition for our Christmas special.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.040]   We're getting warmed up.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.080]   We have a traditional Christmas special, Jonathan Colton, Paul and Storm.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   I love Jonathan.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.880]   John Hodgman, we break out the Yeager.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.920]   We sit around the fire.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   We talk holidays.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   No way.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   You want to join us?
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   Oh my God, please.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   I would start it now.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Come on.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   Don't get started now.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   You'll never get home.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   Oh, God.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   Have you ever tried it?
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   It's bad memory.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   You've tried it?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   When I was younger?
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.920]   I was younger.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   It's quite a licorice.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   I'll have a one sip.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   You really have to down it at the beginning.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   No, it's good.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.920]   It's like Perino.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   Are you having a sip?
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   Should we all share the same glass?
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.920]   There's enough alcohol in that thing.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   It's called Rotterey here.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   By the way, as long as we're matching Jonathan Colton, and then I'll get it back to our...
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   It's really great.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.920]   It reminds me of Jersey Shore or something.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   Yeah, it is.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   You're like Jersey Shore, John.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   Hey, looky.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   You're in Jersey Shore.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   He's totally Jersey Shore.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   Jonathan Colton is having a cruise, and I wanted to give him a ride.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   He's totally Jersey Shore.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   I don't like it.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.920]   I said you cannot buy ads on Twitter.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   We love you too much.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   JokoCruzCrazy.com, their next cruise.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   This is the second one they've done, and I want to go on this one.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   The first one was really fun.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   February 19th to 26th, the Ruba Jamaica.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   Gooh, la wanam.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   No, a Ruba Caracao and Bahamas on the Great Holland America line on the Western Dam.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   It's not just Jonathan Colton.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   Look who is going on this cruise with Joko.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   Besides Paul and Storm and John Hodgman, Vi Hart, she makes these...
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   She's a Mathematician.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   She makes these great mathematics videos.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   I just love MC Frontalot, Will Wheaton, and more to come.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   But you've got a book now if you want to go.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   Reserve your state room JokoCruzCrazy.com.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   I wanted to give them a little plug because we love them.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   And they're going to be back for our holiday special.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   That was the deal.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   I said, "I'll give you a plug."
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   If you come on the holiday special and you do a live concert in our studio,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   so someday we're going to get Jonathan Colton here.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   Moving on, Meg Whitman.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.920]   Oh, God.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   So, now let's John.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.920]   Because John seems like an astute observer of the Silicon Valley scene.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.920]   HP...
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   I wrote about this in MarketWatch twice already.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   Is this not the worst screwed up company management you have ever seen in your life?
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   The board needs to be fired more than you have.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   The whole board, yeah.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.920]   It's pretty bad.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   When they fired...
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.920]   How quickly we've forgotten.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   Well, there was a first.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   There's heard there.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   Leo.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.920]   It's actually Leo.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   Because he's French.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   But which is, by the way,
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   yes.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   Leo, absolutely.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   That's Leo, a pop-up girl.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   That's how I say my name.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   First, they fire Mark Hurd for some sexual pecadillo, which turns out really to be not much.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   He was the guy who seemed to have some...
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   You see, some corporate coffers for hookers?
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.920]   I guess that's nothing.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   No!
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.920]   No, no, no.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   I don't think they're...
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   I don't think she wasn't a hooker.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   She was just...
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920]   She was...
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.920]   She was a generous, romantic film star.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.920]   No, no, no.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   She was a greeter than HP had hired.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   And he took her out of her house.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920]   He took her out.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   Not the latest.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   I don't think the kids are calling out these days.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.920]   I'm way back on escort.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   Anyway, they fired Mark Hurd, who was arguably able to run this company.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   In fact, didn't Mr. Oracle say, "This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of?"
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.920]   And immediately hire Mark Hurd.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   Yeah, well, he says stuff like that.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   Yeah, but he did hire Hurd.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   Leo Apotheker comes in and proceeds to gut the company, says, "We're getting out of the
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   PC business," says, "We're not going to make WebOS.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   Oh, yeah, well, we're going to license WebOS, but we're not going to make hardware confusing
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   everybody."
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   Yeah, he's a software guy.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   He sells the tablet for $99 to great success, even though, of course, they lose $300 a tablet.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   Right.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   Doing so.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   After 11 months, Apotheker is out.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   He's off the board.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   He's resigned as a director.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   He's no longer CEO or president.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.920]   Bring in Meg Whitman of eBay.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   Right.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.920]   And my assertion is she's been brought in because her expertise is in auctioning and they're going
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:11.920]   to take the market, take the company down to book value and just sell it off on bargain-basement prices.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   Well, a number of people said Whitman actually is a very good manager, would be a good CEO,
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   but she's never run a hardware company.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.920]   Right.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   She ran eBay.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.920]   She ran a website.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.920]   She ran a website.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.920]   And a political campaign.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.920]   This doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be switching course from the...
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   Well, that's the question.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   That's the question.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   That's the question.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   Does...
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   That's the loss, by the way.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   Oh, no.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   Unsuccessful.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   Unsuccessful political campaign.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   But that's the question.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   Does this mean that we're not going to buy that British company?
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   We're not going to divest ourselves of the PC business.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   What does she do?
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   She's earned the course has been set.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   And I think the board had a lot to do with that course.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:02.920]   And maybe Leo was straying behind the scenes and they wanted somebody who would stick to the party lines.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.920]   And then I think the big hoop law about killing web OS devices and maybe spinning off the PC business.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   And then switch leaders and then go back on all that.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   I don't think that's in the card.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.920]   So the course is set.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   She's just going to be in there and be a good manager.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   That's the theory.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   A leader.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   That's like the...
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   This theory permeates society in a lot of different levels.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.920]   It happens with journalists where they think that anyone who just gets out of J.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   They go from Columbia and go cover technology.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.920]   So they said they've already intel.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   And they don't know what questions they ask.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   They don't know what to do.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   I mean these are specialties.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   These corporations like HP.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   This is not something where you bring in some journeyman, you know, CEO, cookie cutter person.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   That's kind of who Leo Apotheker was.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   Well, at least he was in kind of the business.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   But I agree with you.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   I think Apotheker was a bad choice.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   There are people in the company at HP that could do this better.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   Now, some people have asserted that her political connections and all she's going to be is a fake CEO
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   that is going to keep these government contracts left because they've got huge contracts with the Air Force.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   They have huge contracts with the Army.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   Those are valuable assets.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   And they're huge.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   And she's a celebrity... and I asserted this in the market watch column.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   She is a celebrity CEO.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   And so she can get a... she can call and she can get...
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   That's a good point.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   People will take her call.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   Some schmuck that's just a, you know, executive vice president at HP that gets promoted.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   Nobody takes his call.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   So is she the front man?
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   I believe that this company would be probably run by the COO.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   It's like a spokesperson.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   It's almost like a publisher in Maggie Cross's nowadays.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   You don't do any publishing.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   Well, I'll put them back in the news in many ways.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   And I think, you know, a female CEO...
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   They've been in the news.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.920]   They've been in the news.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   I mean, this is questionable news also.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   But, you know, maybe it stops people from talking about their products and where they're heading.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   So they talk about her being a CEO instead.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   They still have a very profitable to printer division.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920]   That's not gone.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   Maybe it was smart to sell a PC.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   Or a profitable Inc division is what it really is.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   Inc.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   Right. The printers are just Inc carriers.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   But it's profitable.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   That's very well.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   I don't know how their professional services division is doing, but that's...
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   Well, that's what they hope to become of their future.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   IBM's mini IBM.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   It's a good point you bring up about the government contracts.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   I was talking to someone in the Army's IT who's running some programs about getting smartphones
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   in the hands of soldiers.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:36.920]   And he told me that he got a letter from the people heading the WebOS division who said
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   they were shocked that this had happened and that they were apologizing,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   and refusedly that they were going to have to take back all of their device shipments
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.920]   and that they couldn't work together on this particular partnership
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   because the powers that be said that we're not going to be making mobile hardware anymore.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   Holy cow.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   So I think that's probably a good thought that they'll want to stay on course with the government contracts,
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   with the corporate contracts.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   How many millions is that costume?
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   You've got to figure it quite a good company.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   What?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   Yahoo.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   By the way, I give her an 11 months and then she's out with a 36 million bucks cash.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.920]   Some say I want to know how much.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   That's pretty good.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   That's what the pot they've got.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   You've got 36 million?
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   Holy cow.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   That takes another sting out of it.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   11 months.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   Wow.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   Okay.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.920]   Some said that Mark Hurd should come back.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   You don't think that's the case.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   No, that's never going to happen.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   Well, I knew it wouldn't happen, but...
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   And now you shouldn't come back.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.920]   Jerry Yang says, Yahoo.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   Yeah, we're for sale.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920]   Again?
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   It's a little late.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   Apparently in the company wide memo leaked to Nicholas Carlson,
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   Yahoo has hired Allen and company to field inquiries from multiple parties that have already expressed
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   an interest in a number of potential options.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   That means we're not selling the whole company.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   We're going to have a fire sale.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   We're going to sell bits and pieces.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   Don't you think that's what they're saying?
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.920]   Multiple options.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   What is the other thing?
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.920]   Well, they have a bunch of little companies that they don't do anything with for starters.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.920]   They're very strong companies.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   They bought up all these little companies.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920]   They have Flickr.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   I mean, can be put back into the play.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   But who would buy it?
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   What else?
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   Why would you want a money loser like Flickr, even though it's got a huge audience?
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   Google?
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   Why would the YouTube guys buy delicious?
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   That was an interesting--
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   Because it was cheap.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   It was a million dollars.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   Maybe Flickr will be cheap.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   Maybe everything will be cheap.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   No, because they have to be flaky.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   Now see, if you bought it, I think you could do something.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.920]   All right.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.920]   Let's put together--
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   Yeah, let's buy Flickr.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.920]   Let's buy Flickr.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   Let's buy Flickr.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   The four of us fool our funs together.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   Yeah, we can do a 250 bucks a pop.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   Jerry, I am prepared to lay on this table right now a 1,000,000.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   For Flickr, call us.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   We'll give it to you.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   No questions asked, whatever you want, $1,000, it's yours.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   That'd be great PR for Yahoo.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   They just sold-- I mean, that would make for a great story.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.920]   Y'all, yeah, it'd be great.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   Wow, it's this right there.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   Talk about customer service.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.920]   You wanted it?
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.920]   Here it goes.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.920]   You want to see a stock over the revolt.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   Sell a Flickr for 1,000 bucks.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.920]   But it's funny because Yahoo, like all these sites, you hear, you know, why they're so
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   off and businesses are going horribly, and then I'm in the content game.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   Then you hear, oh, we're ramping up our content.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.920]   We're buying all these shows.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.920]   And you're like, why would I want to be in business and start a show and a whole
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   brand on a site that just doesn't even know who they are?
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   Think about this.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   Think about it.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.920]   They don't know who they are.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.920]   I don't know who they are.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   But Yahoo has--
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.920]   Not knowing who they are.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.920]   Yahoo has 680 million users worldwide.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   They have nine of the number one properties in the US.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   They are big in display advertising.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   They say they're a leader.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   The jury says they're a leader.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   It could be.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   They have an iconic brand.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   There's no question that Yahoo brand has some recognition.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   Yahoo.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   Yahoo.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   Apparently they Yodle at the end of staff.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   They do.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   Company meetings.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   Apparently there's nuisance complaints being filed constantly in that area of the belly.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.920]   The board is looking, of course, for replacement for Carol Bartz, a new CEO.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   Jerry's not going to do it, I think.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   No, some say they're not in a hurry to hire a CEO.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.920]   Yeah, it turns out whether you have a CEO or not doesn't seem to make any difference.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   Whether you have a company or not.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   So it depends on the idea of a CEO.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   So you think basically Yahoo goes--
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   Anderson and Company is a chop shop.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   Yahoo goes to them and says, "Here, chop."
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   Take the steering column.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   Take the wheel covers.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   Take the headrests.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   Just sell it off pieces.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   It's probably worth a lot of money that way.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.920]   I don't think it's worth as much as their market cap.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   But remember, they were offered by Microsoft almost 32 bucks a share.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.920]   Oh, you're going to rub it in.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   What are they worth now?
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   Like 15 bucks?
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   You only got almost 15.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   You only got almost 15.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.920]   These shows that said that deal was never going to happen.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   I can't remember who was that.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   Oh, you were right, but why did they not take it?
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   Well, the funny thing is I still believe that if they took it, the government wouldn't allow it.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   It would have been-- but maybe they'd get a good kill fee for that.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   Yeah, sure.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   We haven't asked you since this happened.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   What do you think of the government intervening on the T-Mobile AT&T merger?
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   Well, I think they had to for political reasons, so it looked like they weren't a bunch of spineless wimps.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   It's an election year move?
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   Yeah, but I don't know if it's going to do any good.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   Because already, I don't know about you.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   Anyone out here is a T-Mobile customer, but the service is deteriorating.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   It is.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   By the minute.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   I just bought a Sprint phone because I figure they're the future of telephony.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   So anyway, anyway, when I went over the T-Mobile store--
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   I've got four bars right now.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   I don't know what happened.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   I'm on Verizon.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   Oh, shut up.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   Verizon works.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   Yeah, Verizon's great.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   What do you want?
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   I got a best bar.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.920]   AT&T.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.920]   AT&T.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   I got a full bar.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.920]   What are you, T-Malls?
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   Four bars.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   Four bars.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   Oh, my God.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   Sorry.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   Too much Yeager.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:42.920]   Yeah?
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.920]   Give that man some more Yeager.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   You some.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:50.920]   So, no, the fact of the matter is I went to the stores.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   I went to the AT&T store and then I went to T-Malls because I want to look at the windows phone and play around.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   You don't use a burner phone anymore?
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.920]   Well, somebody's a sponsored phone.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   It's not a good phone.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   It's not a good phone.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   It was my phone.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   I was paying for it.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920]   He only uses a burner phone.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   You're a drug dealer?
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   No.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   I don't want to see that.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   But there seem to be all these sneakers hanging from the phone wires outside of John's house.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   I don't understand it.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.920]   So anyway, and the T-Mobile store guys, they wouldn't wait on me.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.920]   They were just, they were already quit.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   They already quit.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.920]   They were already working for AT&T.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   So there's no, I mean, and the T-Mobile connections are falling off.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   Do you think that they assumed the deal was going to go through and everybody just kind of vacated the premises?
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   Turn the lights out and whoa!
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   I guess we're still in business.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   I don't know what's going on, but it doesn't, it seems odd that it's so poor.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   Wow.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Okay, in the topic that you feel that.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   I asked you the question.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   I could do that.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   I got the answer.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:43.920]   I got the answer.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   I was hoping for.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   No, you weren't.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:46.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   I understand Apple's got a big event coming up.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.920]   Nancy Devorak, Sheer Lazar, Mark Millian, and Jaeger.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   What more do you need to know, kids?
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   Jaeger's not that good.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   No, it was a bad year.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   It was a bad choice.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   It's a bad year for Jaeger.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.920]   I want to talk to you about websites.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   You know, it's funny.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   We had a guy on the radio show was doing a really cool website.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.920]   It's kind of like a con economy.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.920]   It was an interactive site for people who are interested in biology.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   He gave it away and it was really cool.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   I told everybody to go to interactive -- let me just see if it's back up because we killed
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   the site.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   I told everyone to go to interactive-biology.com.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   This is great.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   It's a neat site.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   Everybody on the radio show went to the site.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   Let me do that.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.920]   It went down.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   Boom.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   Like hard.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   Like it was down for an hour.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   I thought, "Oh, Leslie.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   This guy is Leslie Samuel."
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   I said, "Leslie.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   We got to get you on Squarespace.com."
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   You cannot bring Squarespace down.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   One of the beauties of it, Squarespace is web hosting, really good web hosting.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   Web hosting that is so far ahead of anything else anybody's using.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   For instance, if you get slammed like his site did, they just turn on more bandwidth automatically.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   You cannot shut down a website from Squarespace.com.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   But then on top of that, you get this great content management system.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   One of the best in the business, I'd say the best in the business.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   But you know what the best thing to do is go to Squarespace.com.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.920]   Click that green "try it free" button.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.920]   You need three things.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   A name for a site, a password, and an email address.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   And that's it.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.920]   You've now got two weeks to use the full suite of tools at Squarespace.com.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   Their great social integration means it's so simple to use these widgets to seamlessly include Flickr,
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   or Twitter, or Facebook, or any of fact any RSS feed.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   Boom, right there in your site.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.920]   And the thing is, look at this.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   It's so easy to do.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   You've got little drag sliders.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   You've got drop down menus.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   You don't have any to be a CSS expert to make an incredible looking website.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   No, I do have to point out, if you do know CSS, the sky is the limit.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   I mean, you've got these great point and click interfaces.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   But you can also use CSS, JavaScript, any technology to make your site sing.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   So you're never really, in any way, it's kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   Easy for a novice, but plenty of scope for the professional.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   Take a look at their Android and iOS.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.920]   Yes, now on Android and iOS apps that make it easy not only to blog, but to moderate your website,
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.920]   to kill spam.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   To see your stats, all of this is here.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   Squarespace is a really wonderful host, a fantastic suite of software services.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   And I want you to try it right now.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.920]   Go to the Squarespace site, click that try it free button.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   If you decide to buy, and only if you decide to buy, I want you to use the offer code TWIT9,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   TWIT in the number nine, because we'll get you 10% off for the first six months of your site.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.920]   It's very affordable.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:07.920]   If you go monthly, as little as $13.33 a month, if you buy more, of course it costs less.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   And no matter how much time you buy, you'll get 10% off for the first six months if you use the offer code TWIT9.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   Squarespace, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   Oh my God.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   Whoa, there's some kind of a--
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   It's time for a champagne.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   Oh my God.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   That's high class.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   Plus.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.920]   Yes, I did.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.920]   You didn't want me to forget that?
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   I didn't want you to forget that I was a shark.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   It is Shark Week on Twitch.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   That's the reason for celebrating Shark Week.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.920]   It's celebrating Shark Week.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.920]   It's celebrating champagne.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:43.920]   Champagne and Shark Week.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   Where did you find champagne?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.920]   You have a pile of it back.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   You have a pile of it.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.920]   Is it cool?
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   I'll be bottle.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   Alright, we'll do the honors.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   See if you can hit one of those cameras.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:53.920]   We're celebrating our syndication.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   Yes, let's celebrate our syndication.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   We'll celebrate our syndication.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   Did we not kill all the champagne at the grand opening?
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   Apparently not.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   Oh.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   John found the secret stash.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   It's quite a bit of it.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   I was saving that for the grand closing.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.920]   After this show, it could be any day.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   It could be any day.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   Shark Week on Twitch, and I want to thank--
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   We've had a number of people post videos.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   This is a video of Shark Week.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   It's on our blog inside.twit.tv.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   Here comes the show.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   We apparently--we couldn't afford.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.920]   Shark Week has been big for discovery.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   I tried to get video of people being eaten by sharks,
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   being bit by sharks.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   Why?
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   Because Shark Week, it's huge.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   Don't you realize how huge Shark Week is?
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   It's huge.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   They've built an entire business around it.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   Nobody watches Discovery except during Shark Week.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   Oh, Shark Week.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   So anyway, we couldn't get all that,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   but we did get an inflatable shark.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.920]   Where is our inflatable shark?
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   I think it's flown the coop as it were.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   It's on the coop.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.920]   It's behind me right here.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.920]   There it is.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   The problem is that the shark has kind of lost some--
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   I think it is more helium or something.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   Yeah, it does.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   It's lost some of its helium.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   So this is the end of the official end of Shark Week.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   If you can hit that shark with the cork,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   I'll give you the shark.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   I caught it in a squirt bunch of champagne.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   I don't want the shark.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   Come on, hit the shark.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   I can hit the shark.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   Hit the shark, Shark.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.920]   The most right there.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   This is like a playhouse.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.920]   Whoa!
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   Hiya!
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.920]   You didn't hit the shark,
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   but you did hit the rainbow.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.920]   I love the truck.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   Did you hit the shark?
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   Absolutely.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   The shark can go home with you if you wanted.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   No thanks.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   I'm not taking the co-soure either.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   You're not taking the cup holder either?
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   I mean, there are people in the chat room are ridiculing me for being a hoarder.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   Oh my god.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   Well, you're kind of notorious because every time you come here,
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   you take something.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   Yeah, well, I'm taking the champagne home in my stomach.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.920]   That's good enough.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.920]   Good enough for me.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   Let's see, what else is going on.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.920]   Ok, October 4th.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   According to all things,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   D. Cara Swisher has excellent sources inside Apple.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.920]   Cara says, "Forsher."
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   Actually, I think it's John Pachowski that says this.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   For sure.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   For sure.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   Apple's going to have an event.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.920]   Have you heard anything?
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   No, D and the Journal have a lot of those sources.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   They seem to know.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   Although John got a little upset because somebody wrote,
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.920]   I mean, I guess it was the Wall Street Journal got a little upset.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   Cara got upset.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.920]   Somebody wrote that they have inside.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   Yeah, fortune, which is in my time war.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   In time war.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   In time war.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   In time war.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.920]   Phil Elmer DeWitt over there called John, I think,
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   Apples, like, you know, Choice Boy for Leads recently.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   Which is true, isn't it?
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   That's a good place to be.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.920]   Seems that way.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.920]   Although, I think John took a sense.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   It's great affront.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   There's a lot of corruption in the tech reporting because of this sort of thing.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   I don't think that's corrupt.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.920]   It's totally corrupt.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   How is that corrupt?
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   If somebody from Apple...
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   Oh, let me give you the exclusive,
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   and I expect the cover story and by the way...
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   Oh, there's a tip to tell you people that if this guy doesn't write us up well,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   he never gets the front page of the book.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   It's always a give and take.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   But no, that would be inappropriate if you said I'm going to give you a cover in return for this leak.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   It's always the case.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   So you don't get the leak unless you say something.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   See, I figured Apple...
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.920]   You will get one leak once in your life and then your black ball.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   No, I've never got any leaks.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   If you don't...
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   If you don't perform...
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   I just...
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   This is corrupt at the worst levels.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   Well, no wonder John's taking offense or Keras taking offense because that's the implication.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   Well, it's all about relationships when you're a journalist.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.920]   It's about trust and building that loyalty and then relationships with the sources, right?
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.920]   I agree.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.920]   I've seen you go to lunch with sources to find out what's going on.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   I don't tell them I'm going to give them a front page and half the time I never...
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   Actually, they buy.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   They always buy.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   They always buy.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.920]   It's beside the point.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   I'm just usually just...
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   I'm doing networking so I can accumulate information.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   I can see both sides.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   No, you can't.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Maybe all things D felt that Philip was implying that they somehow weren't really reporters,
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   that they were just getting spoon fed.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.920]   Well, there's that.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   Yeah, there's that.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   Yeah, that kind of falls into it too.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   I think that...
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   No, I think actually all things D does a very good job actually.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   They get a lot of scoops.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   Yeah, sure they do.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   And in fact, it was Keras Swisher who said, "No, absolutely not.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   It will not be September."
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   I remember when everybody was saying Apple was going to announce something in September.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   I suppose it's still possible.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.920]   They've got five more days.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.920]   They tend to be nice enough to give us at least the weeks heads up.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   Yeah, you still get invited.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.920]   Yeah, well, I didn't...
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   You get invited?
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.920]   You get invited?
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   I'm on my laptop in live stream any events.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   That's him.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   That was called a live film film.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.920]   Did that what you did Leo that got you blackballed because you didn't...
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   You didn't tow the line.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   You didn't do exactly as you were told.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.920]   As a journalist, you were just going to let them tell you what to do.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   That's right.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.920]   I didn't.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   I said, "I'm here.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   This was way back when.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.920]   This is January of 2010."
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   And nobody said anything.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   They didn't say, "Hey buddy."
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   I was...
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   Now, I admit, I didn't ask if I could.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   So what?
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   But I saw all these cameras, including CNN cameras behind me.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   So I thought, "Well, everybody else is recording this.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   I don't happen to have my big camera, but I could turn my laptop around."
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   So people in the room don't ask permission.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.920]   It's the rules that kind of go with it.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   And then if they say no, then they say no.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   Nobody stopped me.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   Nobody said anything.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   Apple's rules are often live to tape.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   So you can't run out of tape until maybe...
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   You can't run a tape out to your truck until maybe halfway through the keynote.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   But I wasn't told that.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   I mean, I might have known that.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   But I looked on the back of my ticket and said no recording.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   I wasn't hiding it.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   In fact, I'm on the Apple video.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.920]   I'm taking pictures of you.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.920]   Video streaming apps built into their products.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.920]   I'm using a Mac.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.920]   You think that's the point?
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   You're promoting.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.920]   I thought I had about that.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   But at any event, I don't care.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   And I'm not invited.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Do you get invited to Apple events?
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   I actually, like, I'm in touch with Apple PR, but because I'm in LA, I mean, I haven't
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.920]   really been doing the Apple event.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   John, do you get invited to Apple events?
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   No.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   I've been blackball for years, so it doesn't bother me.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   It's live on TV.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   There's always somebody in that...
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   There's always...
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   They do not stream it.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.920]   There's always some bootleg stream.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.920]   There's always been a bootleg stream.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   It doesn't TV, though.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   I would do that.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   I checked out bootleg streams and they get cut off right away.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   It's amazing how quickly...
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   I was watching...
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.920]   What was that last roll out they had?
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   There was a company in Denmaholland, I think, and these guys were doing a play-by-play,
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.920]   like a boxing match.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   Okay, it looks like a stream went down.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   We've got a stream number three.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   If a stream number three is going to come up, it looks like Joey's.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.920]   It looks like stream three, maybe.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.920]   Yep, there they come.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:25.920]   Stream three's on.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   Let's load three.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   Stream three.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   That was probably a WWDC where there's hundreds of developers in the conference level.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   It was great.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   And they do live stream them, though.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920]   No, they did.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   Well, they did live stream one.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.920]   They did live stream one.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   They did live stream one.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   And then they stopped again.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.920]   You would think Apple would want to control...
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.920]   I mean, if this is all going on and there's live bloggers, too, like crazy, that Apple
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   would just want to stream it.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   I don't understand why that's anyway.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   It says one more thing.nl was the site that I was...
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   So, jacked up on it.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.920]   We are, perhaps, in agreement October 4th.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   Apple will have an event.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:57.920]   All Things D reported this.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:03.920]   They're saying it sources again close to the company, say it will be at Apple's campus, which
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   is unusual, because that's the smallest venue they have.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   That's very small.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.920]   And all the iPod events in September.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   Right.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   It's traditionally where they have those.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   That's where they announce the iPod socks, the iPod high-five.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   Excellent product?
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   Yeah, excellent product.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   So, oddly, I'm not sure...
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.920]   It seems like this is going to be a bigger announcement.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   Probably.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   Because I think I would expect an iPhone.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   A new iPhone, yeah.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.920]   We all know that, though, but that's what they're going to announce.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   Maybe two.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   There's rumors that will be a low-end iPhone 4S, primarily for China and the international
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   market, but also available in the US, and an iPhone 5 that will have higher-end features.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.920]   If they do an iPhone 4S, it'll probably look just like an iPhone 4, but have a Qualcomm
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.920]   dual chip.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   CDMA, GSM.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.920]   Yeah, I'm on pins and needles about that.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   I could tell you're so excited.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.920]   It's that champagne tickling your nose, John.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.920]   Do you think Steve Jobs is going to appear at these events?
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   Would he be in appearance?
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   One guy told me, I won't say his name because it's kind of embarrassing that he even thought
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.920]   this, thought that Steve Jobs would say one more thing and announce Apple TV at this event.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   Oh, they're actual TV?
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   Oh, they're real TV.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   TV, yeah.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   That's a TV for them.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   That's got to happen.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   You think that's going to happen?
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   I think it has to happen.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   They're out of ideas.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   I don't think so.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   And I've talked to a million people about this, and I think anyone in the audience would
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   agree.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   A lot of people would just buy it because they know it would be cooler.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   There would be something cooler about it.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:33.920]   It would have more features.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   It would do something better.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   It would have an Apple logo on it.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   It would definitely have an Apple logo on it, and I think it would probably have some
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   things about it that would be so, it would probably be built in Apple TV.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.920]   It would probably have this magical buzz around it.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   It would make, they could make more money on their TVs than anybody else could.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   It would take Sony right after the movie.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   This was, this was, this was, this was, this was, this can really make money on TV, so, right?
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   It's not saying a whole lot.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   Well, it's, it's.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   The theory was that Steve wants to leave, he, you know, look Steve's leaving Apple.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   That's no, he's left Apple, but he wants to leave them with one last product.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   You know, the last thing he did was the iPad.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   He wants to leave him Mark and, and take over.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   Well, he's already created another industry.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   He just wants to, it's like, it's like a final push on the swing.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   It's like, I'm just going to leave with a little bit more momentum.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   Here's one more thing.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   Well, the one thing.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   And now he can fade into this.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   The Newton two.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   That was John Scully.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   Don't, don't blame Steve.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   Well, the one thing he wasn't able to fully accomplish besides iTunes and figure out a
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   new, a model for the media landscape, I think Apple TV would be that new thing that he
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.920]   ships and creates a new business model for media.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   So many reasons why it would be a terrible idea, but I, but I'm the real TV.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.920]   I think it's a terrible idea.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   Why?
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   Well, as Mark pointed out, nobody makes money in this.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.920]   Well, how about Google TV?
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   It's a difficult.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   But Google TV isn't a TV.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.920]   Which they already have an Apple TV device.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920]   It doesn't work.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   It's not working about a TV set.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920]   TV set.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.920]   The problem is, you know, you got to carry it into the genius bar if it breaks.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   I mean, Apple, this is too big.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   TVs don't get updated every year like other Apple products.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   So it's kind of a strange model for them.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   And what do they need if your arguments valid?
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.920]   They have to create the real connected living room, right?
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   Well, it is the last piece, isn't it?
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   And they've been selling their hobby Apple TV for some time.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   I think they could upgrade that.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   Maybe put apps on the Apple TV.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   That would be interesting.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   So that's the obvious one.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   Well, what are they going to do?
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920]   What are they going to do?
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   What's the Encore?
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   What is the one more thing?
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   The one is not an iPad 6 or any such thing.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   Apparently, the rumors are they don't have a very big announcement in the iPod world.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.920]   They're going to update the touch.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   They're going to make a white iPod touch like sure it has.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   They're going to make maybe make it a little bit faster with the A5 chip.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   But they're not going to upgrade the camera on the iPod touch.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   New lens?
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   They're not going to change.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   No.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   The iPhone itself will have some upgrades.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   But they don't have big iPod announcements.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   The iPhone will have the new Sony 8.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   Oh, Sony.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920]   Again, this is not an Encore.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.920]   This is just more of the same updated.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   That's why I think Steve needs to come out and really say something.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   Maybe...
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   How about an automobile flying car?
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   The new Apple flying car.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   Oh, I thought I was going to do it.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   Boy, I'd buy that.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.920]   Well, you can afford it.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   The big announcement this week.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   Let's find out what's coming up this week because Tom Merritt is in the TNT newsroom.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920]   What?
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   No way.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920]   This is a new feature?
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   But don't you watch the show?
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   This is time for the week ahead.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   Tom?
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   Here's a look at what we'll be covering on Tech News today in the week ahead.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   Monday, September 26th, President Obama travels to Mountain View for a town hall meeting,
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920]   this time with LinkedIn.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920]   He loves to go to Silicon Valley.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.920]   Also, Cellular South is rebranding itself to sea-spire wireless on that day.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   Tuesday, September 27th, Happy Birthday Google.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   They were founded in 1998 and the kickoff of HTML5 DevConf in San Francisco.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   Wednesday, September 28th, Amazon holding a press conference in New York City could be
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   the Amazon Kindle tablet.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   Thursday, September 29th, Battlefield 3 open beta begins and the HTC Rime ships.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   Friday, September 30th, Transformers, Dark of the Moon, Blu-ray is due, but not the 3D version.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   That one's coming later.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   And Saturday, October 1st, the alternative press expo in San Francisco kicks off.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.920]   And 4chan turns 8.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   Happy Birthday, 4chan.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   Finally, AT&T starts throttling unlimited users.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   There's a limit to your unlimited.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.920]   That's what we'll be looking at in the week ahead.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   All right, let's move on.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   Amazon, the big story really I think this week will be Amazon.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.920]   We will be covering this, by the way, even though it's 7am Pacific, 10am Eastern on Wednesday.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   I want to make a public announcement.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   I admire the fact that you cover a lot of this crap live.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   Thank you.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   You're welcome.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:44.920]   And we do it because, although there's no evidence to prove otherwise, we believe that
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   in the long run, if we can be like the CNN of tech by covering breaking news, more people
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   will watch.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   That hasn't been the case.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   It's super smart.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   But we're doing it.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   I think it's smart.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   You have to be at the pulse of everything that's going on.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.920]   That's the theory.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   And you can cover stations around them.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   Yeah, that's the theory is that if something big is happening, you'll tune on to it.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920]   We covered FA, the Facebook announcement.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920]   People want insight.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   They don't want to just watch what's going on stage.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   They want insight from the experts.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.920]   We talk over announcements from all the big companies.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   Actually, I got a lot of heat.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   And this actually tells me that we need to do this.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   We didn't cover the build, Microsoft build conference where they talked about Windows
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.920]   8.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.920]   There was a lot of positive buzz from there.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.920]   I should have streamed it live.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   We didn't.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.920]   And I will never live it down.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.920]   See, they're saying it right there.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   Leo dropped the ball on build.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   So I guess we'll be covering this Amazon thing.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.420]   At 7am, they're going to hold a press conference.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.920]   We don't know what it is.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   But we're going to take a wild chance.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920]   It's going to be a tablet.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   Then it might be an Amazon tablet.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.920]   So 7am will be covering this press conference live.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   We didn't get an invitation, no.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   But what the hell?
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   Why is that?
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   Why don't you get invitations?
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   I think they don't know we exist.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   No.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   Andy Inaco, though, will be there for Mac break weekly.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   And he will be joining us for our live coverage.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   Does Andy not transferable?
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.920]   I'll just forward it to you.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.920]   There you go.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   Yeah, you don't want to go here.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.920]   And then you'll get kicked out of your head.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   No, I'm not going.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   It's not transferable.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   It doesn't say not transferable either.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.920]   Did you RSVP?
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   No, we have reporters in New York.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920]   You don't need to go.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920]   Making the trip.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920]   No, I don't know why.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   You know, I understand why they wouldn't invite me because of TWID.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.920]   Because, you know, this is like some podcast.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920]   But your influence are still.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920]   I host your influence on this show.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920]   I hope.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   But forget, it's podcast.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   But I host something that they do understand, which is a nationally syndicated radio show,
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920]   in 170 markets.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   It's listed to a million people every weekend.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.920]   Actually, 2 million people every weekend.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.920]   Why they don't acknowledge that, I don't understand.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.920]   Maybe they think I don't care.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   I care.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920]   I really care.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   No, you're actually on the wrong...
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   The problem is nowadays the public relations companies that are behind all of this,
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   to be honest about it.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   They still think magazine.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.920]   No, no, they're thinking bloggers and they're thinking...
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   Oh, that's true.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.920]   Twitter is...
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   Right?
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   And so they don't even pay attention to anybody who...
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   Tweet?
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   If you were a...
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   Tweeting is part of coverage, right?
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   If you were a two-bit blogger, you would get a lot more attention.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   I almost say it's not even about...
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   You don't need to necessarily blog something, just being there live-
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   How many...
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   ...tweeting helps?
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   How many followers do you have?
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   A bit over 32,000.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   How many followers do you have?
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   For what?
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   Twitter.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   81.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   How many followers do you have?
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   Oh my god.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   7 or 8.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   No, come on, Twitter followers.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   7 or 8,000?
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   Yeah, just curious.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   You got 250, 350,000.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.920]   Yeah, why made you buy?
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   I only bought half of them.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   Just wondering.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.920]   Amazon is going to...
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   I'm not going to be working myself up to over 100,000.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   Can you still hop?
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   I've never heard that term before.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920]   Well, you know...
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   I've heard of jerking yourself down.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   Really?
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   You have?
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.920]   No.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   Can we get this thing back on track?
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   I don't.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   So you're covering the Amazon?
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   So, yeah, it's moving on.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.920]   What do they...
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.920]   So we know what they're going to announce, because M.G.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   Seagler talked about a scoop.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.920]   Actually, is the only person I know of who's handled the Amazon tablet?
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   He wrote a good piece on it on TechCrunch.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   Do you think they traded that for something on TechCrunch?
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   No, it's not a trade.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   No, it's not a trade.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   TechCrunch.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Developers have it.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   So, he's probably friendly with one of the developers.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   Ah, okay.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   So what do we know?
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.920]   It's a 7-inch tablet, and they're talking to...
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   Touch screen?
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   Color?
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   Does anyone...
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   They're just going to replace the Kindle.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   Yes.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   No, no.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.920]   They'll still sell the Kindle.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.920]   I don't know about that.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   I hope so.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.920]   I have one.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   In fact, they may sell it for a lot less.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   It's already $114.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   They could probably go down even less.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920]   I think that's always been the goal.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920]   Yep.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   Sell this for $250, as what M.G. said.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   Which may include an Amazon Prime subscription worth $80.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   Yeah, let's make it a better deal.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   Makes it a better deal, in fact.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   And that Prime subscription, as you know, you're a member.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   It's brilliant.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920]   Yeah, brilliant marketing.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.920]   Yeah, because you buy whatever you want and there's no shipping
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   and you get it cheap at the beginning.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   And you keep going back to Amazon time.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.920]   I mean, I buy more stuff on Amazon because of Prime.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.920]   I mean, it's a win-win.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920]   Yeah, I think, as ever once in a while, I see some hardware
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   or something, I say, "Wait a minute.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920]   Maybe it's on Amazon.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   I find it on Amazon sometimes cheaper, sometimes not."
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   But with shipping, it's usually cheaper.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   I just bought an espresso tamper.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.920]   Now, normally, I would have gone to a local brick-and-mortar store
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.920]   to buy that espresso tamper.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920]   Really?
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920]   Where would you buy this?
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   I don't know.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.920]   That's why.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   I didn't know.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   But you like...
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   To go out...
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   To just the bottom of a spice jar.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.920]   I mean, you don't really need to buy...
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.920]   He likes to be fashion all.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920]   He likes the specific tool.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.920]   Wanted an espresso tank, you sure?
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.920]   I get it.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   You're a geek.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920]   Geeks want the tool.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   I wanted an espresso tamper and I got one.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.920]   On Amazon, free shipping.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   It was like $3.79 plus free shipping.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.920]   Anyway, touch-screen, $250.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920]   What else?
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920]   Oh, one person suggested.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.920]   What do you think of this that maybe it would flip-flop in a year
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   and if you buy prime, you'd get a tablet.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   What do you think about that?
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   You get free streaming video now.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.920]   I don't know about a year, but maybe...
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.920]   That's some point.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.920]   It will run Android, but it won't be an Android anybody's scene
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.920]   before it will be a completely customized Android experience.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   It looks like cover flow, according to MG.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.920]   And I don't think they'll have the Android market on there.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.920]   They'll only have their proprietary App Store.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.920]   It does explain why they created an App Store.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   I check the App Store every day because they have free apps on it.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   So there's, again, brilliant marketing.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.920]   And developers are the best marketer ever, I don't know.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.920]   Developers are furious about that because the deal is Amazon essentially says
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   we're going to, at random, choose to put your App for free in our store
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.920]   and you're not getting any of that money, but we're giving them every-
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920]   Well, they get some of it.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   They give them like one-third of the face value of the App.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920]   I don't think so.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920]   No, I think that was the deal.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   They get a little bit, but not as much as they would have gotten if they sold it.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   You know what was on two days ago?
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.920]   MLB at that 2011.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   With the $15 app for free.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   Wow.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   They must have been kind of pissed off about that.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   I mean, it's good promotion.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.920]   I don't know.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.920]   You know what?
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.920]   I'd love to know.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.920]   Maybe somebody in our chat room is a developer, Android developer,
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   who's been put in that position.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.920]   Do they ask first?
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.920]   Injade says they ask first.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   Can you say no?
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   I don't know if you can say this.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   Do they promote for a day?
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   You get one day?
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.920]   No, that's not that bad.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920]   One day?
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   You get some money, but not as much as you would get.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.920]   That's how much you would pay for the promotion.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920]   Nothing.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   Nothing.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   I don't know.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   I heard from some developers saying it went too deeply into it, though.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   Is MLB 11 could be free at this point, because how many weeks are left in the season?
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920]   It's almost over.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   But you get the post season.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.920]   I know you guys already lost, so who cares?
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.920]   Everybody's saying you get nothing.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   I am sure I saw that you got like one third of the face value.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:00.920]   We get into the MLB app and it wasn't very good, says Monty.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.920]   Oh, no.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.920]   Monty, what are your favorite apps?
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.920]   If you don't like the MLB app, you don't like life.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.920]   Do you have an app of go-to app Leo?
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.920]   Oh, I many go-to apps.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.920]   I'm a big Amazon, I mean, Android fan.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.920]   You're Android?
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   No, I'm John.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   Okay.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.920]   iPhone, iPhone, and an Android fan.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.920]   You don't have an iPhone, right?
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.920]   No, I get one of those.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   But that's because you're too cheap to buy an iPhone.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   It gets free products.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.920]   You only use the free.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.920]   Hey, obviously whatever.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.920]   I know, I like it because of the bright, bright screen.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   You have that Samsung super emily.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.920]   Samsung, I appreciate that.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   Right.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.920]   You know, Samsung doesn't make it, but it does say Google in the back.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.920]   I thought, and I think that's kind of cool.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   You feel really modern?
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.920]   It's prettyjelly.wordpress.com.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.920]   I'm sorry, Amazon App Store rotten to the core.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.920]   Yeah, we interviewed them on our show.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.920]   They were very upset.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.920]   Publicly, their terms say they pay developers 20% of the asking price.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920]   See?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920]   Publicly, that's their terms.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.920]   In fact, even when they give it away free to both customers and naive developers alike,
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.920]   it seems like a big chance to make something rare in the Android world real money.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.920]   But they don't pay developers a single cent.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   You get an email saying we'd like to do it.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920]   The current price of this placement as a free app is 0% rev share for the one day.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.920]   In other words, they did, I wasn't wrong, they did say they were going to give 20% to the developer,
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.920]   but they in fact give them nothing.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.920]   This is something I think a lot of content and creative people are dealing with now where distribution is easy to get.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.920]   Like anyone will put up, if it's a good piece of content, will put it up or create a syndication deal.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.920]   But paying for it is...
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920]   Except for making money.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.920]   Except for making money is an issue even if people want to promote it.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.920]   What do you think of Amazon getting in, you know, they're having their publishing now, division,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920]   Tim Ferriss and everything?
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.920]   And not only that, but apparently they're going to do book rentals.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.920]   Somebody found some code in the Kindle code that the Amazon book rentals.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   Well, they're kind of like Netflix.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   You pay a monthly fee and you get books.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.920]   Well, you know, the libraries are now going to begin offering books for the Kindle.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920]   Interesting.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.920]   So you can go check out a book from the library, but you never get to check it back in.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   This is basically a free giveaway.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:19.920]   John Sutter writing for CNN Tech, your compadre Amazon and hopefully the end of late fees for books.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.920]   Kind of a Netflix for books.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   Kind of interesting idea.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:30.920]   Furthermore, dish and blockbuster are starting and Netflix for dish customers.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   Netflix.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.920]   What is the prognosis for Netflix?
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.920]   They really took, I think, a black eye.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   Reed Hastings, in fact, had to mail out an email last week saying, "I blew it.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920]   I'm sorry."
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   But then the Quickseter.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920]   Wait, are you going to go?
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   Yeah, I knew he was.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   Does Quickseter not do it for you?
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920]   Quickseter.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920]   That's the DVD.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.920]   So they're going to split the DVD portion off from the streaming portion.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:14:00.920]   They'll be Quickseter, which is DVDs by mail, which is a business that probably everybody agrees is going to go away because the movie industry isn't going to let them do it for very long.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   The licensing issues.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   The studios have been squeezing the hell out of them.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.920]   They say you can have three discs.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   They say you can't have it for 28 days till after it's been in the stores.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.920]   They're just really squeezing the hell out of them.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920]   But the streaming business.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.920]   What do you think?
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920]   That's a good business.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   I feel like the studios are squeezing those too.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.920]   I would think the studios don't mind the streaming business as much because it can't be pirated.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   They don't mind if they pay if they...
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.920]   Pay per play, perhaps.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:32.920]   Well, maybe that's an option.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:39.920]   But if someone like Netflix or Voodoo or one of the other streaming services or Amazon pays a huge amount of money for these deals, they don't want Netflix cutting another stars deal, which is the base.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.920]   Hi, I'm Reent Hastings, CEO and co-founder.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920]   He's a little loud.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.920]   I had a DVD operation in Netflix.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:54.920]   We've been working for the past 14 years to build Netflix year by year into the best possible service we could build.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:01.920]   We're making this video today to apologize in person, or at least on camera, for something that we did recently.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.920]   Yeah, zoom in on Reent.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.920]   Zoom in.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.920]   Zoom in.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.920]   We've got to...
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.920]   Here, I'll do it for you.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   I'll do it for you.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.920]   This guy, the new quicks of the rawr or something.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   I think he did it in back of the building.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.920]   They're like, "Okay, we're going to do our announcement video now."
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   They didn't even move the trash cans.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   Now, Shira, would you have ever produced this anything like that?
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   I think it's better.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   Well, the thing is, I think they wanted to find raw and feeling real.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.920]   It's real.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.920]   It's authentic.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.920]   He should have done it in his office.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.920]   Like, why outside here?
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.920]   It's kind of random.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.920]   But yeah, they put it up on a Sunday night.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:34.920]   They knew, going into Monday, everyone would be talking about it.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.920]   We spoke about it on our show, which is trending on Tuesday.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.920]   And definitely think it's a response to the studios.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.920]   I mean, it all comes down to that.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.920]   Do you want to keep the DVD business going, even though streaming could be good for them?
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920]   Stock market did not like it.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.920]   That's hilarious to watch.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   The market over the last year or so, everybody has been talking about trying to short Netflix,
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.920]   because the numbers were always crappy since it was at 100 and went to about 250.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.920]   And no one ever was successful doing so.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.920]   By the way, you can go to the DH Unplug Show, and you can listen to us talk about this.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920]   What's the DH Unplug?
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   Myself and Andrew Horro was talking about stocks.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.920]   Did you say to short Netflix?
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920]   Yeah, right at the top.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:11.920]   I nailed it.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   You're kidding.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   No.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920]   I got to listen to this.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.920]   And it's like, I think it's headed to 60.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.920]   So you still think you could short it?
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.920]   Yeah, I think you're still playing a time.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.920]   I've never seen a company like this that had such a loyal early adopter following, just
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.920]   plunge.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   I love Netflix.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.920]   I mean, really just make a real decision that just didn't connect with the consumers.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   Larry, Larry, I mean, not--
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920]   Right.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920]   Do you agree with me?
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.920]   I am sure.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   I'm getting him.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.920]   Whatever it is you said.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   Thanks.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.920]   Research organization surveyed Netflix, 1,000 Netflix subscribers.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.440]   Actually, 1,000 people, 700 subscribers, 350 non-subscribers, and asked them, now this
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.640]   was August 22nd.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.280]   So this was right before the price change.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.280]   9% of subscribers said they would cancel instead of switching to a new plan.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:04.880]   7% that said they'd cancel has nothing to do with the price change.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.920]   Another 14% said this seriously considering canceling.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.360]   It comes down to the hassle.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.920]   Why do you want to kind of receive that receipt?
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:13.920]   Get this.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.920]   Do you want to be paying for two separate services, two separate things?
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.920]   Get this.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.920]   60% of Netflix users use Redbox.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.920]   Of Netflix streaming users?
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.280]   They just say Netflix subscribers.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.280]   You know why?
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.280]   Because you don't have to wait.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   You go down to the Redbox.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.360]   They only have what has 20, 50 movies.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   All the new stuff.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360]   But it's there.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.160]   You go, you get it, and you got it.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.080]   And nobody wants to wait.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.900]   And maybe that movie isn't on streaming because there's such a limited supply on streaming.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:46.880]   If you want a current hot film, that's how you'll do it.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.120]   30% of those people indicated they would use Redbox more in the future due to price
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.880]   changes from Netflix.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   So the Redbox--
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880]   That's not a good sign for Quickseter.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.840]   No, Redbox may be the winner out of this.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.880]   And a lot of analysts have said that this move sets it up for one of these divisions
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.440]   to get acquired.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.560]   Whether it's Netflix to Amazon or Quickseter to--
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]   Who?
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560]   No.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.020]   Do you think Amazon wants to be in the DVD by mail?
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.900]   They're already doing streaming for their prime users.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.380]   Yeah, I think they would want to be in the stream.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.780]   They would want those prime users.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:20.780]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.500]   Although they do have a big mail infrastructure, obviously.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.620]   To me, I'm a big net.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.740]   I started using Netflix in 2000, which is 2001, right at the beginning.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.500]   How do you have time to even watch a move?
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.500]   I don't.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:33.500]   I have the same five discs from 2000.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.740]   I would just be collecting dust.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.660]   But I really love the idea.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.180]   I really think Netflix is a great company.
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.980]   We actually went to them and said, would you please advertise on Twitter because we
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.980]   love you?
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   And they said no.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.280]   I saw them on the grand opening sign.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.020]   They said no several times.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.560]   We finally made a deal with them.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560]   We do advertise their streaming business.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560]   Interesting, though.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   Not their DVD business.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.280]   Netflix does a lot of deals with YouTubers.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.280]   Nope.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.280]   And those are all CPA deals.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.560]   They're direct action, direct response.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.920]   They're not getting the big dough.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.560]   Well, Epic Mealtime did it.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.280]   Well, revision three does a lot of that.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.760]   And the click-through rate to subscribe and pay.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.020]   I mean, they got a lot of click-throughs.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:16.380]   And so Netflix is supporting the YouTube crowd, it seems.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:17.380]   Good.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.180]   Hey, anybody who supports Epic Mealtime's got my vote.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   They're pretty awesome.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.820]   Did you see the petition to end software patents?
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.220]   Apparently, it is doing quite well.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:36.100]   If you go to WhiteHouse.gov where they've been asking people to give their input on various
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.100]   political issues, 10,000--
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.860]   This is a great story.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.860]   Patitions.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:47.340]   Well, you know what the number one petition is.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.140]   Legalize marijuana.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:53.620]   But-- and I don't actually-- I should see-- let's see what open petitions are.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.340]   It's pretty awesome, though, right?
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.340]   It's bad.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.340]   Just ban the TSA as another one of the top five.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.340]   Examine the governor's government.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.540]   That's back down on puppy mills.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.540]   Great.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.740]   This is really cool that they did this.
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.740]   It is.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.740]   That's interesting.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.740]   Let's see who the most popular one.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.100]   Legalize and regulate marijuana, 34,000 signatures.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.100]   Abolish the TSA.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.940]   Abolish the TSA, 20,000 signatures.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.940]   That's--
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:18.700]   Investigate the case of Sholom Riboschkin.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.460]   16,000 signatures.
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.780]   Sholom's got a lot of friends.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:27.380]   Eliminate under God from the Pledge of Allegiance 12,000 signatures.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:30.420]   Allow industrial hemp to be grown in the US once again.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.180]   That should have been done years ago.
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.460]   10,000 signatures.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:40.580]   And then coming in at number six in the grand petition scheme,
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.180]   direct the patent office to cease issuing software patents.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:43.980]   But you know what I bet?
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:49.740]   If every single person watching this show went to WhiteHouse.gov
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:54.100]   and signed that petition, we could make it even bigger
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.900]   than the legalized marijuana.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:56.740]   Or sign both.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.780]   And then it'll both be bigger.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.540]   I wonder, though, the action-- it'll
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.580]   be interesting to see if they take any of the actions
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.420]   or listen to this.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.260]   There's a difference between putting something up.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.300]   I could tell you, they ain't going to abolish the TSA.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.900]   They're not going to legalize marijuana.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.380]   And I don't know who Sholom Rishkin is,
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:12.940]   but I don't have high hopes for him either.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.300]   Well, what's the point?
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.660]   What's the point I asked?
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.580]   I feel like they're connected.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.260]   Obama used to do a lot of these YouTube town halls
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:24.100]   and Google town halls, where they would crowd source
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.580]   questions from Google moderator.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.100]   Or stop doing those, didn't they?
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.060]   They stopped doing those because the top question would
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.660]   always be when is weed going to be illegal.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.100]   Hey, it's on the minds of Americans.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.580]   Because who else is watching this stuff
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.420]   but you had to own a stone.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.620]   You know what worries me, though,
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.700]   is the fact that Obama and all these politicians
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.020]   do these Google chats or Facebook chats.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.220]   And it's not journalists that are interviewing these people.
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.260]   So these are the only chats we look at as, oh, a real Q&A
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:48.940]   of what's going on.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.100]   We linked in one another.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:53.580]   The fact is all the questions go through their people.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.860]   So in the end, we don't really--
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.100]   You're saying it's all a PR thing?
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:21:59.860]   It is?
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.660]   It's actually a production.
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.620]   Is that an objection coming up?
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.060]   It's fun, by the way.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.220]   But it worries me because these are the major ways
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.980]   they're connecting and doing these live conversations.
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.780]   I want to have a live conversation done by a journalist
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.020]   and not just during the debates, right?
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:16.460]   And that's just--
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.180]   Nice to field questions from reporters.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:18.940]   They're just not--
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.300]   Yeah, but I want to see a reporter--
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:21.540]   --with the productions.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.540]   --actually doing it.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:25.420]   I mean, people go to Cara Swisher sometimes, you know,
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.180]   obviously for big interviews.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.540]   And politicians should be doing that too,
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:31.260]   with reporters doing a live stream,
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.620]   going to an outlet instead of just--
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.260]   And it's just as corrupt with reporters.
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.900]   If you had $120,000, you know, you could get dot lazaar
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.100]   as a web domain.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.020]   I thought it was $250,000.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:40.500]   Did you know?
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.340]   It's $250,000.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:42.540]   You know?
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.340]   It's way higher.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:44.500]   I think it's $250,000.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.700]   You know, London's going to do it.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.140]   I think it's the port.
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:48.780]   The City of London.
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   Dot Leo.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:53.740]   The City of London is going to have a dot London domain.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.780]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.620]   I think it's cool.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.540]   And then if-- or Damon's calling.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.540]   And then if you're--
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.540]   Who's Damon?
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:00.900]   Thanks.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:01.460]   Nothing.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:01.980]   All right.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.500]   Moving on.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.820]   Let's see.
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:07.860]   I think that's the end of it.
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.140]   Why don't you go get a call from Damon and we'll just--
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:10.460]   Oh.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.140]   We'll just write it.
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.700]   Let's put that on the air.
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.340]   I don't want to end this.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.300]   No, we don't need to end this.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:15.300]   I know.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:15.820]   I know.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:15.820]   I know.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.340]   I know.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:16.900]   It's done.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.780]   No, no, no.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.980]   She sure is busy right now.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:20.140]   I'm going to do the bunch of guys.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.620]   She's--
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:21.660]   --is anything, you know, the bunch of guys.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.740]   John and Mark and I.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.500]   Well, we're friends.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.620]   No, it's OK.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:28.940]   Really.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.500]   We'll be popping bottles.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.740]   Well, there was a little Jaeger Meister involved here.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.580]   But you know, well, I know--
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:35.500]   She can hold her own.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.060]   She can hold her liquor.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.660]   No, she can't.
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:39.820]   Oh, all right.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.420]   Well, thanks.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.020]   Anyway.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.380]   So that's about it for the show.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.780]   We want to thank you all for joining us.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:46.260]   Mark Million is at CNN.com.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.540]   What's you covering this week?
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.580]   What are you excited about this week?
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.180]   Anything?
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.020]   We'll see what happens.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:50.780]   That Kindle tablet.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.740]   That Kindle tablet.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:52.420]   That could be cool.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:53.820]   Yeah, it could be cool.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.380]   I just downloaded Neil Stevenson's new novel,
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:00.100]   Reim D on the Kindle, because I want to read that right away.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.500]   And that's really great to be able to just say, OK,
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.380]   I'm going to buy that and read it right away.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.660]   Will you read it on an LCD screen?
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.100]   You know, it's funny, because I put it on both my iPad and my Yink.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.300]   So you switch between--
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.740]   But that's the nice thing you can.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.700]   I even can have it on my Android phone.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.540]   So you can-- you know, whatever you want.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.060]   You said.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.020]   Sheerlazar, what's trending.com.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.180]   Your next show, Tuesday.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.340]   Tuesday 10 AM Pacific Time 1 PM Eastern.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:23.620]   And with Snoop Dogg.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.060]   We have some awesome guests, Snoop Dogg, and his daughter
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:26.500]   performing.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.820]   She hasn't performed ever.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:28.580]   What's her name?
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:29.260]   Snoop Puffy.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:29.700]   Cory B.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.540]   Cory B.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.940]   Yeah, so that would be very cool.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.500]   Shizzle, my name's cool.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.260]   And he works a lot with Viddy.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:35.540]   Have you heard about this Viddy?
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.900]   It's like, have they approached you?
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:37.780]   No, V-I-D-D-Y.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.660]   V-I-D-D-Y.com.
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:42.180]   It's like you upload 12 seconds.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:42.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   I've seen the Snoopster on there.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.300]   A lot of stories are using it.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.500]   So Snoop, I think, is going to be positioning himself.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.980]   Is that what you-- is that what the kids call him?
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.820]   That's what the kids are calling him.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.380]   He was at Sean Parker's party last week.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:55.880]   I know.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.140]   Did you guys get invited to that party?
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:59.340]   No.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:24:59.840]   It's funny.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.300]   So Sean Parker, we're--
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.060]   I'm a friend.
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.620]   Like, he's on Facebook and we're friends.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.460]   He's on Facebook.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.820]   He's the first president of Facebook.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.100]   But it's so fun.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.340]   It's funny to watch his updates.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.940]   Also, when something like F8 was going on in the parties,
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.980]   it was really funny to watch all his updates.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.100]   And if you're friends, it went to this blowout.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.980]   Sean Parker's Spotify party that was after F8.
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:21.780]   And they had Snoop Dogg, he had killers.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.780]   Yeah, they had a lot of cool people.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.300]   And Jane's addiction was just in September.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:25.780]   Like, there?
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.100]   He's with MySpace now.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:27.600]   I know.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.100]   So he's like a guy.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:28.600]   He's right.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.940]   I mean, he owns MySpace.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.140]   That don't--
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:30.940]   --bought MySpace.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:31.700]   But Jordan is $50.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.340]   He's like, he's taking his character too seriously.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.700]   He had an entrepreneur go ahead and like,
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.940]   you could be Sean Parker.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:36.660]   You know that.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.500]   Like, you have that--
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.580]   Oh, and so he said, OK, well, what can I buy?
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:40.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:40.980]   MySpace.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:41.480]   It's hot.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.660]   MySpace could be, you know, the next music network.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.540]   We actually work a lot with MySpace.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.100]   I know this sounds crazy with what's trending.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.740]   They have been sending us a lot of music guests.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.860]   There's still a lot of independent musicians
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:53.940]   who use MySpace.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.180]   And I feel for them, they're the ones
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.780]   who are going to suffer most from the absolutely imminent
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.140]   collapse of MySpace.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:00.940]   I don't think it's good.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:05.380]   It's long for this world, even with Justin Timberlake running it.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.180]   John C. Devorek, what are you excited about this?
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.500]   Not a damn thing.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.300]   That's what I thought.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.300]   Aww.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:11.980]   Well.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.980]   Just drink yourself.
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:13.660]   Drink yourself.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.180]   I'm going to drink myself to death.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:18.620]   No, you got a good couple of Noah agenda shows coming up.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.820]   They're pretty interesting because--
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:20.940]   You and that Adam Curry guy.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:21.420]   Adam Curry?
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:22.460]   Former MTV Vee-Chey.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.340]   Noah Geneshow.com should check that out.
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:26.300]   It's probably one of the best.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.620]   Did you notice there are quite a few Noah Genes bricks on the wall?
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.140]   I looked back there.
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.220]   In fact, a little side story here.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.220]   You told me this before.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.860]   I went back there and looked and looked and looked.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.660]   And that's one of the reasons I wrote that call.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.300]   I'm saying that Windows 8 sucks because you can't
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.140]   find anything if it's on a tile.
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:44.540]   Because I could not find the Noah Geneshow logo.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:46.700]   Actually, that's quite an insight.
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:47.740]   I think you're right.
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.340]   I'll find them.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:48.980]   I know where they are.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.820]   So I wrote a huge column on this.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:51.820]   There's one brick that says--
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:53.140]   And then it is doomed because of this.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.860]   There's one brick that says "In the Morning."
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:55.340]   OK.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.660]   And I think there's one that says "No Agenda Show."
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:58.460]   I didn't see it.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.860]   You have some big time producers working for you.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.140]   I should point out, the brick sales
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.460]   are ending in five days.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.660]   At the end of September, this is your last chance
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:10.500]   if you want to be on the brick wall in the entryway
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500]   of the new brick.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:12.500]   We would love to have you do that.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.140]   Yes, I will do.
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:13.500]   I will do.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.340]   Would you share a thank you?
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.540]   I'll keep this one, but I will get you one.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.060]   Get the cheap one.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:17.060]   Yeah, they're small.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:18.980]   Hey, put your handprint on it.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:19.540]   You know what?
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:20.900]   There's people's faces on there.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.180]   Because you can get a logo brick.
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.500]   That's all that counts.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.500]   We spent, as I mentioned, $1.2 million building the brick
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:26.780]   house.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.980]   And a quarter million of it came from brick donation.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.820]   So I want to thank each and every one of you.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.740]   You got a quarter million bucks on brick donation.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.900]   Yeah, but it's not even the money.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.940]   I'd give the money back.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.780]   I just like to go out there.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:37.660]   Give the money back?
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.500]   On a day when I'm down.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.900]   I'm sad, I'm low.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.660]   I go out there and I read those inscriptions.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.260]   And it's very, very moving.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.460]   There's memorials to pets.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.060]   Memorials to pets.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:50.060]   Are you kidding?
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:51.660]   My kitty's dead.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.540]   Thanks for the show, Leo.
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.260]   That's fantastic.
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.900]   And you too can have one of those.
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.620]   If you go-- no, actually, there's a lot of really neat stuff.
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:01.820]   It's a wonderful thing to have.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.900]   And we love having it at the entryway of the brick house.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.980]   And there's still a little more room if you want to participate.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:11.820]   bricks.twit.tv.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.660]   I thank you all for joining us today.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.460]   We do this show every Sunday at 3 p.m.
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:20.540]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2,200 UTC at twit.tv.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:25.140]   Or if you're on a PS3 live.twit.tv, a special page for PS3 users,
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:27.740]   and anybody who wants just a simple video feed,
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.540]   you can do that.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.860]   You should also make sure you tune in during the week
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.620]   for the latest tech news on TNT with Tom Merritt,
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:38.460]   230 Pacific, 530 Eastern at twit.tv.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.740]   And of course, a special broadcast.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:44.780]   Wednesday morning, 7 a.m. Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern,
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.380]   as we cover the-- what I hope will be the announcement
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.220]   of the new Kindle tablet.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.820]   If it's not, we're going to be--
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.220]   we'll be just sitting there.
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:53.860]   Have some talk.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:54.340]   Anti-climactic.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:55.700]   It will be boring.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:56.460]   You know what happened?
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.900]   We were doing the FA conference.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.860]   And they had told us that the developer conference,
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.260]   the Facebook developer conference on Thursday
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.620]   will start at 10.
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.980]   So I meander in about 9.30.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.820]   And somebody sitting on the board saying, his on, it's on.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:10.140]   They started already.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:11.300]   So I go running over.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.060]   I said, go live.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:12.940]   Go live.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.340]   Mark Zuckerberg's already on stage.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.260]   They're making announcements.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:15.780]   I sit down.
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.660]   We start talking.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:20.020]   The chatroom says, oh, Leo, that's last year's announcement.
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.060]   There's running down the street.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:23.580]   That's good.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.420]   I said, I thought this sounded familiar.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.340]   It was known.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:27.180]   There's no new announcements.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:30.140]   I actually did say, I believe Mark's recapping last year.
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:30.780]   You're going to be because--
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:31.620]   That's hilarious.
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.780]   Yeah, there was nothing going on.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.340]   Anyway, we did cover that live.
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.940]   Now, have we put that out on the special stream?
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:37.340]   Yeah, it's out now.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.020]   So if you go to twit.tv and look in the specials section,
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.300]   click shows and see specials.
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.660]   We put that out.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.980]   Tom Merritt and I and I as talking about the Facebook
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:48.140]   FA developers conference.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.260]   We'll do the same on Wednesday with the Kindle.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.460]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.220]   We'll see you next week.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.900]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:54.900]   This is amazing.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.400]   Woo!
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.900]   >>Yeah, all right.
