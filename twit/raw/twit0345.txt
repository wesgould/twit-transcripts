[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.760]   It's time for Twit this week in technology.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.000]   We cover the week's tech news in obsessive detail.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.760]   And we're proud to do so.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.400]   Joining me right now, my old friend, former producer
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.880]   of the screen savers and call for help now at ABCGMA.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.760]   Good morning, America.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.560]   Becky Wharly, good to see you.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560]   Great to be here.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   I haven't been here in ages.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   I'm so glad to get you in.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   No, I missed you guys.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   But I'm a seasonal person, so I'm
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.160]   eight months away from Black Friday.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   So I'm OK.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   I can't.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   I'm OK.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.640]   I can come see you.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.600]   Does it get crazy?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.760]   And you've been doing--
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.400]   on Good Morning America, you do a lot of TV infomercial stuff.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.680]   You're still doing that?
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.760]   I'm now doing exercise stuff for them.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   Very broad-based consumer tomorrow.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.240]   You are the Jillian Michaels of Tech, actually.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.080]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.880]   I appreciate that.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.840]   My abs will aspire to that.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.360]   That's great.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.160]   Tomorrow you can find me teaching people
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.040]   how to get exercise while doing their housework.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.760]   Oh, geez.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   Oh, I know.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.200]   I thought housework was exercise.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.720]   I know.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.000]   Well, there's a way to get even more.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.640]   Get even more.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   You just got to--
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.120]   I get exercise while doing podcasts.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.160]   I just hold it in.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.160]   Oh, you ball.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.120]   Not more movement.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.960]   I sit on my ball.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.320]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.560]   Also here, Denise Howell from the Bag and Baggage blog.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.120]   And of course, the host of this week in law.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.760]   And you-- I don't look now, Denise.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.120]   You've got a little panda bear climbing up on your microphone.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.640]   It's OK.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.160]   It's OK.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.660]   It's OK.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.160]   Don't freak out.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   You can sort of meck with a jockstrap over your other shoulder.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.200]   Yes, the chameleon has been banished to the other room.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.280]   So I'm pretty sure that nothing immediately around me
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.240]   is a living, but should anything crawl into the screen just
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   let me know.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.600]   Denise is the fabulous host of this week in law.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.560]   And we really love having her on the network.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.720]   And it's so great to get you on Twitter.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.360]   Everyone's still wild.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.240]   We should get you on more, frankly.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   I love doing it.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.960]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.360]   And we want to welcome a newbie.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.200]   And as soon as you meet this next person,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   you might say there's something going on with this panel
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.000]   and there is, let's welcome Joanna Stern.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Now, of ABC, congratulations, ABCNews.com/tech.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.640]   Thank you.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.760]   Nice to have you.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.560]   I was going to hold up a picture of a man.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.440]   I was like trying to look for a magazine here.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.840]   I see a little picture of us.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.400]   No, that's the wrong song.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.520]   No, I don't have anything.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.760]   So how long have you been at ABC?
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.520]   You just went there.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   Three weeks.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.160]   Really?
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   Really did just go there.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.920]   I just finished three weeks.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.440]   Wow.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.120]   How's it been?
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.520]   It's been great.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.440]   It's been a very interesting adjustment
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.320]   to go from the world of tech blogs and tech sites
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.720]   to mainstream media outlet.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.480]   But it's been great.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.720]   It's been really fun.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.640]   The new iPad launch made it a crazy couple weeks.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.480]   But definitely a good way to start.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.960]   I mean, just get thrown in there.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.280]   What other way would there be in tech?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.120]   Well, let me introduce you to your colleague at ABC.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120]   Becky Orly.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.480]   I begged Eileen.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.520]   I said, get you in on it for having a check panel.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.320]   Because you've never met.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   We've never met.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.840]   I'm like, we're going to be--
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.320]   We've tweeted.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.960]   True.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.320]   True.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   That is not the main world.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.280]   It's not the main world.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.800]   I know.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.480]   I know.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.760]   I wish I could be in that studio right now, to be honest.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.320]   I do too.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.840]   That one would really--
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.440]   Well, the next time you're out here, come--
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.120]   did you fly out--
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.120]   I will.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   I'll have to come soon.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.960]   Did you fly out to the Apple announcement
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.600]   a couple of weeks ago?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.320]   I did.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.840]   I did.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.640]   I should have gotten in that.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   I should have come that week.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.320]   But then I went straight to South by Southwest.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.920]   I'll come back for the next Apple announcement,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.680]   which I'm sure will be in a couple of weeks.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.160]   It has been a really crazy couple of weeks for tech people.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.680]   Did you go to South by Becky?
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.520]   No.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.040]   I was on vacation in Hawaiian.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.440]   I said, never--
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.600]   I've never been to South by because it coincides with the
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.360]   "Homan Housewives Show" people.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   If you're going to test Swiffers, you've
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.800]   got to go to the "Homan Housewives Show."
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.680]   Well, the second year I went "Shamewow."
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.320]   I mean, the second year I went to "Homan Housewives,"
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.360]   I searched Twitter.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.760]   There were 14 tweets from the show.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.520]   It was happening at the exact same time as South by where
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.200]   there were like 30, 17,000 tweets.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.840]   Is there a hashtag for "Homan Housewives"?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.760]   I don't know.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.920]   I'm going to type it in right now and see.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   It'll have something to do with like silicone from the kitchen
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.360]   or something.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.960]   I mean, it's--
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.640]   One tweet.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.880]   One tweet.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.320]   Isn't that classic?
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.040]   That's it.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.760]   And there is a huge show.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.840]   I mean, it's maybe half the size of the CES convention
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.200]   space, but it's massive.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   And you found one tweet.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.040]   That's really hilarious.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.440]   They're not really geeked out there.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.160]   Not so much.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.880]   Not so much.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   But if you're in "Tout Twitter," they'll set up shop there.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.680]   There are probably more women at the "Homan Housewives"
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.080]   show than there are at South by maybe not.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.640]   Oh, definitely.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.240]   I've never been to South by.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.800]   So the reason I mention that is you may notice that this is--
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.640]   usually, I have to say, I hate to say it,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.120]   but we are kind of-- the panels are male-dominated.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.200]   They tend to be sausage-fest.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.800]   But--
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.960]   We know nothing about that.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.160]   I don't know what the analog--
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.080]   you said it to "Donut Fest."
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.920]   I don't know what the analog is.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   I'm sorry, sir.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.760]   He just snorted his coffee.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.440]   I apologize.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.880]   I timed that very poorly.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.280]   But this is March is the month of women's month.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.520]   Right.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   It's also March Madness.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.040]   So there's no dude who is getting out of here.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   NCAA.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.600]   So welcome.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.000]   We're going to do a panel of all women.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.040]   And already, I've really just destroyed--
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.280]   I'm just going to shut up now.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.320]   But I would like to just reassure the men who
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.560]   are watching and listening.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   And ladies, I just want to make this pact, OK?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.920]   We will not discuss getting more girls in technology.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.440]   Thank you.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.160]   We will not.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.960]   Except for this one, "Disclamatory Time,"
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.840]   use the word menstruation.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.560]   And we will not try and convert anyone
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.520]   to follow us on Pinterest, OK?
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.040]   OK.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.800]   Let me ask, because I am a big Pinterest fan.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.040]   I just promised we wouldn't.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.160]   Can we talk about how much I hate pink gadgets?
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.720]   Is that on those?
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.560]   Yes, that's good.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.480]   No girl gadgets.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.240]   We don't like those.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   OK.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.080]   They do-- you know, they're still-- in this day and age,
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.600]   they're still-- what is the-- there's a cell phone that
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   is for women.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.280]   It's the rhyme.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.400]   Yeah, the rhyme.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.840]   Joanna, you see rhyme.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.000]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.360]   Does that--
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.920]   I have it right here.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.840]   You got the dongle, Joanna?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.520]   Rhyme with the dongle.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.080]   That seems--
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.640]   I'll reach over.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   --the contrarian.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.040]   So you-- so-- I mean, does that work?
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.480]   I mean, must they wouldn't do it, right?
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.000]   There must be-- it must actually
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   work to market a phone to women.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.400]   I thought the bedazzling kits were good enough.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.560]   You really need something that's at an operating system
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.960]   level or--
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.600]   Is it a pink desktop?
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.480]   What do they do, Joanna, to make that a woman--
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.560]   Trying to find my dongle.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.320]   So the dongle was the biggest part of the women--
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.240]   So they-- the women--
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.560]   They customize the dongle to make it more--
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.880]   So the dongle lines up and you put it on your bag.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.080]   Oh, dear.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.320]   So when you-- it's for women who have their--
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.600]   and it's actually not a terrible idea.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.320]   That's clever.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.560]   So the phone is in the--
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.200]   the phone is in the purse.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.160]   And the thing lights up outside the purse,
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.480]   so you know it's ringing.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.840]   That's actually a good idea.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.160]   I could use that.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.360]   That's not a bad idea.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.640]   I like the add-on dongle.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.760]   That wasn't the worst idea.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.080]   The worst thing was that it only came in purple.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.640]   I found it.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.720]   Here's the dongle.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.400]   Oh.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.440]   It's a purple dongle.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.080]   OK.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.440]   It's a purple dongle.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   It only came in purple.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.000]   So it was really heavily--
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.040]   without saying it was for women, they said it was for women.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.920]   That was my biggest problem with it.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.520]   But it was a pretty clever idea.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.280]   I actually--
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.520]   When I had written a editorial when I was at the Verge about it
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.400]   and a lot of men wrote in saying,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.960]   we would have also liked to buy this phone,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.240]   just wish it wasn't purple.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   Right.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.200]   No, I like purple.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.280]   Purple is a good color.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.920]   You're wearing purple.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.520]   Purple is a good color.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.600]   And it is a fun--
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.520]   It's not pink.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.120]   From a used case scenario.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.560]   I mean, a dude's not going to have the thing in his pocket
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.160]   and then have the dongle hanging out.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.760]   Well, we carry briefcases.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.800]   We carry the briefcases.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.400]   Nobody carries a briefcase.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.800]   My dad still has a briefcase.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.400]   No, no, no.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   You're right.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.200]   Nobody does carry a briefcase.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.120]   We carry backpacks.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.800]   We carry backpacks.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.520]   OK.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.640]   Clutches.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.200]   Manbag.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.040]   Man purses.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.720]   Manbags.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.240]   No.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.720]   Merses, as they call them.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.440]   Merses.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.120]   Let's move on.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.360]   Yeah, I'm going to be looking for the Rhine the entire show.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.280]   No, it's OK.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.480]   We got it.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.800]   Actually, I think--
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.360]   I think I knew you reviewed it, didn't you?
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.520]   For all of that, Android?
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.880]   I agree with Joanna.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.600]   But the worst part was actually the commercial.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.800]   The commercial for the Rhine.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.320]   Oh, right.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.520]   This thing with the multiple hands.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.200]   Because women.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   Oh, you do so much.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.400]   Because we multitask, right?
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.400]   She's an Indian goddess.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.680]   This was the worst.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.520]   That was the worst.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.360]   It's so interesting.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.840]   Because Verizon's the same company that
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.480]   does the robots for the droid ads.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.680]   And I wish I could find that editorial right now.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   That was the whole point of what I had written,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.280]   was that if Verizon hadn't gone so heavily
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.720]   with that marketing of it being for men,
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.760]   maybe they wouldn't have had to do this sort of reverse
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.160]   campaign for, oh, well, now look, Android for women.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.680]   The droid ads scare me.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.560]   I don't think they're for anybody.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.920]   They're horrible.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.360]   But anyway.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   So the one with the razor with it basically cuts off
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.680]   everyone's head or the lampposts.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.640]   It's horrible.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.280]   What's-- who are they selling that to?
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.600]   People who want to cut off lampposts.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.120]   It's really sharp.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.000]   So this was the week the iPad came out.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.200]   Now, Ms. Worley has not seen a new iPad.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.680]   I will-- what?
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.160]   I know.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   Can you believe it?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.760]   I said, I haven't seen one yet either.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.880]   So do you have any of that?
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.240]   Well, here, you can look at that.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.960]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.160]   Go ahead and just type on that.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.800]   What do you think about it to me?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.760]   Isn't it?
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.360]   It's really good looking, isn't it?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.200]   No, I'll tell you, at first, I thought
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.760]   this screen was going to-- your eyes
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.080]   would go like Jessica Rabbit with boing.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.720]   But they don't actually do that.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.920]   It's not immediately apparent how much better it is.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.320]   But as you spend time with it, it gets better and better.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.600]   You really--
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.160]   Where do you notice it most?
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   Well, launch a book application would be one thing to do.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.840]   Because text is, of course, incredibly crisp.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.760]   So I'll launch the Kindle app.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.240]   And you'll see kind of immediately that it's--
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   Also in video, in HD video, it really, really looks good.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.480]   Well, that's one question.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.680]   Because, OK, the screen is quad resolution 3.1 megapixels.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:49.040]   And it is now 2048 by 1536 means it could do 1080p video.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.760]   But on a screen that size, I don't know.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.040]   Is there much of a difference between a 720p video
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.680]   and a 1080p video?
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.440]   Do you notice a difference?
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.160]   I mean, I was testing some clips I have here.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.760]   And definitely the 1080p video I downloaded from iTunes
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.200]   looks way better on the new iPad versus the iPad 2.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.560]   I mean, you definitely see the difference.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.720]   But you see the difference at even standard definition
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.440]   video on that screen.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.040]   I just feel like it's not--
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.000]   It's the same IPS style LCD screen.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.760]   It's not a super AMOLED or something.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.520]   But the resolution is so high, it is, I think,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   260 pixels per inch that it just feels a lot crisper.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.080]   Feels a lot faster.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.240]   And the color saturation is higher, too.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.680]   So colors look better.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.080]   But you know what I'm most excited about?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.480]   And I don't hear a lot about it.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.960]   I think the camera blows me away.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.560]   So I should have a question for you.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.440]   Do you take pictures a lot with your iPad?
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.400]   Yeah, you want to see what it looks like when I take pictures
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.560]   in my iPad?
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.200]   For those of you listening, Leo has the cover of the iPad.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   Well, I have one of those--
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.720]   I have one of those--
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.960]   I have one of those iPad covers that--
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.400]   see, the camera is right down here.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.840]   So normally, the cover folds over the camera,
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.240]   so I have to do that.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.880]   Or you could take a picture like this, which is equally
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.560]   kind of dorky to have the cover hang down from the bottom.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.280]   But you know what?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.040]   I think we're all going to get used to the idea.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.080]   Even when I pull it out, it still looks kind of silly.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   But I think we're all going to get used to the idea.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.520]   Because it is-- you know, it's essentially
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.080]   the same sensor, I guess, in the iPhone 4
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080]   with a lens system from the iPhone 4S.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.720]   But it is so good.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.800]   It really is so good.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   And what's exciting about it is you're seeing the image--
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.960]   it's like a view camera.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.480]   That's cool.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.840]   Remember the old days when--
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.360]   on the three stooges or the Wild West movies,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.560]   they'd have a guy and he'd have the thing on the tripod
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.080]   and he'd put a black hood over his head
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.880]   and say, watch the birdie.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.720]   And this is-- you could almost do that, put a hood over your head.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.600]   And because now you're seeing a full frame rendition
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.280]   of the picture.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.120]   Well, not the point was made is when have you ever
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.280]   been able to take the video with the same view as it will be--
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:52.760]   Exactly.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.960]   --conceived as it will be conceived.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.200]   And so as a result, I think it is a remarkable experience
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   for a videographer or a photographer.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.040]   And then you add to that that this has got LTE, which is really
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.400]   fast, and you've got great software on it.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.520]   I think that in some ways the camera might be, to me,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.080]   the most exciting part of this.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.920]   I really like--
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.400]   So that sounds the inner--
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.720]   Everything--
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.200]   Go ahead, John.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.680]   Sorry, I can't--
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.280]   No, no, no, go ahead.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.600]   I say that's interesting because I just
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.560]   finished writing my review.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.040]   I've written a number of pieces on the iPad this past week.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.440]   And I wanted to take some time and write the review.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.640]   So the review will be up tomorrow.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.440]   But I come to the conclusion.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.000]   And I don't want to--
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   I mean, it's the conclusion everyone else has come to,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.960]   which is really that the screen is the biggest part.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.120]   But that other biggest improvement is the camera.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.080]   But I'm not sure a lot of people buy a new iPad for a camera.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.280]   But it's funny.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.120]   I've been hearing that a few people just
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.680]   don't really see the improvement in the screen.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.520]   It's not as dramatic as I expected it.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   Playing the role of John C. Devorah, I will step in and say--
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:49.960]   What do you think?
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.920]   Do you sing it for the first time?
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.440]   What do you think?
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.960]   This is the first moment I've laid eyes on.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   I know exactly what the specs are.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.560]   I know everything about it.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.480]   And that expression that you just had there--
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.920]   That's your opinion.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.440]   I don't know.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.600]   The camera function's cool.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.440]   Am I going to use this?
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.480]   I'm a video creator.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.680]   Am I going to run around and make videos on this
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.200]   and send them off via LTE?
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.720]   No.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.220]   No.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.280]   Because I can't depend on it.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.480]   Is this cool?
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.680]   If I didn't have one, yeah.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.520]   If I was upgrading from one, maybe.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.240]   Is this going to make me upgrade from two?
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.680]   Absolutely not.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.040]   Here's some video that I shot.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   That's the end of the video.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.160]   It's very good video.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.400]   Wow.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.120]   OK, that looks cool.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.320]   It's nice.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.200]   It's very-- this is walking around.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000]   The other thing is it's a little more stable because of its size
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.240]   than a little mini camera or your smartphone.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.040]   Right.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.880]   Yeah, no.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.120]   They're incrementally improving the product.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.200]   But I'm with Becky.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.560]   I'm not going to upgrade from an iPad 2 to get this device.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.880]   Iterative, not innovative.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.680]   And the teardown was interesting that big battery, huge battery
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:49.880]   in there.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.200]   It went to, I think, 45 watt hours from 25.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.160]   And you need to, obviously, for LTE.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.240]   I think that's more for LTE than it is for the screen,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.840]   although we don't know that it's got a much faster processor
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.880]   and a much, of course, more dense screen.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.960]   But I was wondering in the Wi-Fi only versions,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.040]   do you get a boost then?
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.520]   No, I'm actually--
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.640]   I'm in the corner of my apartment right now running
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.360]   a battery test.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.240]   I'm running the same HD video on both the iPad 2 and the iPad 3.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.520]   And I expect that the iPad 2 will last probably a little bit
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.800]   longer or around the same amount of time as the iPad.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.400]   And I have LTE off, the new iPad.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.960]   I have LTE off just running on Wi-Fi
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.640]   because I expect that the screen, they've boosted the battery
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.840]   just to give you just as much as you
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.800]   would get on Wi-Fi on the iPad 2 because of the screen.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.440]   Yeah, I think we're saying--
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.840]   so it's not the LTE that it is the screen that's
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.080]   sucking all that juice.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.320]   I don't know if that makes sense.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.720]   One more-- one more-- you'll get an hour or less with LTE on.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.200]   Right.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.880]   So you've boosted the battery just to compensate enough
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.680]   for that screen.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.000]   Wow.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.280]   So I was completely wrong.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.400]   It is the screen that's sucking all that juice.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.000]   LTE is notorious for being a battery hog.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.120]   But that's 10% more.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.680]   If it's only one hour, it's going from 10 hours to nine hours.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.840]   That's not a huge--
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.400]   Not bad.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.080]   One more point on the teardown--
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.560]   $4.99 retail price estimated cost to build at $3.16.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.400]   Does that sound that right?
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.920]   That's more than the old one.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.600]   But that's a decent profit margin.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.640]   I think Apple would like more.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.720]   But of course, I'm sure they make more if you buy the LTE
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.840]   or you buy more RAM.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.160]   Right.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.480]   Also in the teardown, we're finding that it has--
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.080]   let's see.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.960]   The A5-- I guess we knew everything else.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.200]   So it's really the battery size that's new information.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.760]   It didn't seem like there were any shockers on the wires.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.280]   Nothing, shockers.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.400]   There's 5X in there and so forth.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.560]   The funny thing was--
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.520]   they also found that there was one gig of RAM, which Apple
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.720]   hadn't confirmed.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   Same thing with the Apple TV.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.840]   It's now 512 instead of 256.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.800]   They doubled the RAM there too.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.720]   And Apple never talks about RAM, which
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.520]   is part of this post-PC strategy.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.880]   We shouldn't have to talk about that stuff.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.960]   It's back on the issue.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.720]   It's just about performance, user quality--
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.240]   Can it work?
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.720]   --qualitative, not quantitative.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.600]   The funny thing about this release
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.360]   is before I went on vacation, I went out and recorded
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.960]   from my Yahoo show all the wraps for the new announcement.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.800]   So it was the new iPads here, the iPad 3 is here.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.120]   This was before they-- you didn't know.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.960]   At Pad HD, you had to go through all the names.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.720]   The iPad HD is here.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.520]   And then I did that.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.360]   Were you smart enough to say just iPad?
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.320]   Yes, I did the new iPad.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.160]   I was so stoked.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.400]   And then the best one was the A5Xs
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.560]   that that had come out.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   Every single thing that was out was almost--
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.760]   There were no surprises.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.600]   It was absolutely as predicted.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.100]   So--
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.080]   Wow.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.840]   You should have let me know, because that would have really
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.240]   helped with Search placement if we had all known the name.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.400]   Well, next time, it will bring mine.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.760]   It's so funny, because I kept calling
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.640]   it the iPad 3 or the iPad HD.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.160]   And that was just totally wrong.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.320]   I still need to call it the iPad 3,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.280]   because if you just say the iPad, it's ambiguous,
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.320]   especially since Apple still sells the iPad 2.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.680]   But going back to your spec point,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.600]   they wanted to be qualitative, not quantitative.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.920]   So new is good enough.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.240]   It's all just the iPad.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.720]   First thing, I called it the iPad new.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.080]   And rhyme so well with iPad 2.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.720]   iPad new.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.520]   But then what happens next year?
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.360]   The iPad not so new?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.080]   Who is the only iPad new?
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.600]   The next.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.160]   Newer.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.880]   The next new--
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.960]   Newest?
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.360]   What do you think, Denise?
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.600]   This strikes me as a strange choice.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   It does.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.720]   I can't tell you they didn't consult with me, so--
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.960]   It's certainly the stock market didn't mind.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.000]   The price broke $600 this week for the first time ever.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   Again, Apple, the most valuable company in the world,
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.360]   based on stock price.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.080]   Don't you just keep saying it can't keep going up?
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.760]   I feel foolish for having such negativity about the possibility.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.440]   And then at some point, everyone's going to go, OK,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.680]   it can go sky's limit, whatever, trillion bucks, no problem.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.080]   That's what they're talking about.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.440]   What is it?
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.680]   $700 billion they're worth now?
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.280]   They're saying, you know, we could be worth a trillion.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.760]   I remember when Apple was extoked--
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.960]   this is how old I am--
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.880]   because they were a $2 billion company.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.840]   Wow.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.520]   I remember when we were talking about stock price on Mac Break
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.480]   Weekly, we said, well, it might hit $200,
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.400]   but it sure won't go much higher than that.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.240]   Scott former saying it.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.120]   It'll go higher.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.680]   It could go to $250.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.000]   And I thought you're crazy.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.560]   So now--
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.160]   It's just an interesting point that Mike Elgin said
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.400]   that the next generation of Bluetooth on this device
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.560]   is actually a big deal.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:23.760]   Oh.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.880]   Can someone explain that to me?
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.000]   Everyone's like the Bluetooth 4.0 is amazing.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.480]   That's the big deal.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.640]   I know nothing.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.320]   Is it--
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.880]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.920]   I mean, do you really use Bluetooth on a tablet?
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.280]   Well, for keyboards.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:36.760]   Ah.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.160]   Keyboard for your car.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.440]   I suppose.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.440]   To have a few--
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.800]   You could have that synced.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.240]   Synet saying it's a game changer.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.560]   The first Bluetooth smart ready device
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.560]   allowing it to connect with the billions of Bluetooth
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.040]   devices and the next generation.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.560]   It's overlight.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.360]   That's the issue.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.720]   It's the next generation, I guess.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.200]   Yeah, I know.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.840]   That's overlight.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.080]   Just never--
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.880]   I never can keep it quite up to date, can I?
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.800]   So apparently CNBC right now is announcing or reporting
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.840]   that Apple is going to make an announcement tomorrow morning
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.640]   at 9 AM about the company's cash balance.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.920]   They say this is breaking.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.080]   Yes, this is breaking news.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.920]   And I was just about to say it.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.120]   The question is, what would the announcement be?
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.640]   Is it evident?
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.960]   They have $100 billion.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.240]   They were expected-- or it was hoped by some.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.560]   I think that the stockholders mean that they would offer a dividend.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.920]   And of course, they didn't.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.400]   They've never offered a dividend.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.520]   It's got to be.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.680]   You think it's a dividend or you're
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.240]   going to announce that they're going to buy the planet Earth?
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.040]   Maybe just Italy.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.720]   Well, they could just buy Italy.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.220]   OK.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.120]   Tim Cook had said, you know, I've always loved Italy.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.880]   I love the food.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.440]   I love the wine.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.560]   I love the people.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   Let's just buy Italy.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.960]   Right.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.920]   That would make obvious sense.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.720]   We could call it Apple-y.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.220]   OK.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   I'm just saying Apple--
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   To rival Italy.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.200]   --in Apple-y in olden days.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.880]   I'm going to back into this American life story with this little boy.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.480]   Oh, beep, beep, beep.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.000]   Back it up.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.480]   Beep, beep, beep.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.240]   So here's the day.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.600]   There's a story that we'll talk much about, which
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.040]   is this American life retracting the episode.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.120]   You can talk about it right now.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.760]   About Apple and the Apple factories.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.440]   But the last act of the episode talking about this thing
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.240]   said that Apple could build their devices in the US,
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   the iPhone, for $60 more.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.320]   That was the study that came out about a year ago.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.520]   People might say, oh, it's going to be twice as much.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.160]   Or it's going to be--
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.320]   no, it's not a significant difference.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.880]   Because they only pay about $5 to the workers in China
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.200]   to make that device.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.240]   So they pay $65 to US workers.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.760]   Done.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.400]   And the supply chain has commoditized
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.640]   that labor isn't that much of a big deal in terms of changing it.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.160]   So my crazy out there is Apple's building factories in the US.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.800]   And they're going to--
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.760]   $100 billion.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.200]   That'll build a few factories.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.640]   You know what?
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.160]   That would be great PR.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.480]   That would be great.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.080]   That would be--
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.360]   And I hope she's right.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.320]   It's so outrageous.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.040]   I'm so wrong.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.360]   But that's just like my crazy--
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.080]   You know, I love that idea.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   That is a great idea.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.480]   It's good for America.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.800]   Good for American workers.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.280]   It solves the problem--
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.080]   this embarrassment with Foxconn.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.000]   I think you're brilliant.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.600]   Let's do it.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.760]   There is a problem.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.000]   There is a problem.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.080]   There aren't enough workers.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.800]   No, it's the supply chain.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.360]   It's getting the stuff into China.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.200]   I mean, out of China.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.520]   It's the flexibility.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.280]   This was the point they made in the episode.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.760]   It's just in time manufacturing.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.000]   It's like, hey, guys, down the street in screw factory,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.360]   or that didn't come out right.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.120]   In glass--
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.520]   There's a factory for that?
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.920]   In glass factory or, you know, bracket factory.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.000]   Can you make 50 million more of these
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.840]   and get them to us by tomorrow?
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.960]   Well, they might have to build some of those factories here.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.720]   So anyways, that's my cookie end around that I think
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.080]   that that's my wild idea or dividend.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.800]   But--
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   I like the idea of building factories here.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.920]   How could-- that's a win everywhere.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.400]   Now remember Steve Jobs when he went
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.480]   to that famous dinner it's talked about in the Wall Street
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.160]   Walter Isaacson biography with Mark Zuckerberg
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:13.680]   and many other Silicon Valley luminaries.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.160]   The one thing that Jobs brought up with Obama is, you know,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.000]   it's-- there's too many regulations for me
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.600]   to build a factory here.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   But remember, in the early days of Apple,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.240]   they did make MacIntosh's here.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.880]   They did make Apple 2's here.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.320]   This is a more recent development, offshore, the manufacturer.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   Steve was very proud of the next factory
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   where they built the cube.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   Right.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   The built here in America.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.840]   What was fun designed in California was weird.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.880]   I mean, that's great.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.440]   That's super.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.040]   But I prefer made in America.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.960]   I'm-- and that's-- I don't know.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.120]   Yeah, when designed in California,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   made by slaves in China, doesn't have the same ring to it.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.000]   New.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.400]   Somehow.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.720]   No.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   So OK, I'm going to-- this is going to get crazy.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.520]   We're going to take a break.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.440]   I'm going to circle back on this Bluetooth.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.760]   And then we'll talk about this American life thing
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   because it is kind of an interesting story.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.440]   Maybe a little bit of a journalistic story.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.920]   And then I also have a question for Denise
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.760]   because we had the weirdest question on the radio show today.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.680]   And it raised a fascinating legal issue.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.920]   What if your neighbor had a Wi-Fi access point
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.360]   with a name that was so horribly offensive
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   that you couldn't browse your Wi-Fi?
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.720]   And when people came over to visit,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.960]   you'd have to say, I'm so sorry.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.800]   We have a horrible neighbor.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.840]   And what if that happened and what would you do?
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.320]   We'll answer that question in a second.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.760]   That's a tease.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.320]   That's a tease, baby.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.440]   But we want to also say hello to-- is that Josh over there?
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.120]   How are you?
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:41.880]   Good to see you.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.400]   It's Tech TV Week here at the Twit Brick House.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.000]   Good to see you, Josh.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.120]   This show brought to you by our friends at Citrix
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.280]   makers of go to meeting.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.400]   Have you ever been to a go to meeting meeting?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.320]   Oh, you've got to try it.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.080]   It's amazing.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   First of all, they've added to it.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.960]   Go to meeting is the original screen sharing online meeting
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.640]   application.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's just fantastic.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.560]   If you've not tried it, you've got to try it for that alone.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   But now, they've added high-def video.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.720]   So this is actually a brilliant move.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.560]   It is a conference call, as well as screen sharing,
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.760]   all tied together.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.920]   And if you try it on the new iPad,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.000]   you're going to be blown away by the quality of the images
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.120]   you see here, because, of course, you're
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.000]   getting this great video.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.720]   Yes, you can share your picture from the iPad camera.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.520]   You see she's doing it right there.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.760]   It supports the touch.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.560]   Of course, it works not just on the iPad,
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.680]   but it works on Macs, PCs, iPhones, Android devices, as well.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.400]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.240]   Visit go to meeting.com right now,
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.040]   g-o-t-o meeting.com.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.280]   Actually, when you get there, there's a big orange,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.160]   try it free button.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.960]   Click that and use our offer code TWIT for 30 days free.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.640]   Then get the free app for iPad or iPhone
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.440]   and try a Go to Meeting with the HD Faces video.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   It's really spectacular.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.360]   Free for 30 days.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.800]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.160]   You got a meeting coming up?
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.080]   Blow 'em away.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.320]   We do regular meetings now.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   We're doing a site redesign for the radio show.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.800]   We do regular meetings.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.200]   They call them scrums.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.960]   There's this whole agile development thing.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.440]   And you have sprints, and you have scrums.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.200]   And it seems too athletic for me.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.400]   But anyway, in these meetings, occasionally,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.280]   we want to review wireframes.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.360]   The company we're working with is a distributed company.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.400]   Lullibot doesn't have an office.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.520]   People learn Rhode Island.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.640]   People learn Minnesota.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   They're all over the place.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.000]   So we use Go to Meeting, and we can look at the wireframes
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:37.680]   together.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.880]   We can see each other.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.200]   It's just really fantastic.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.880]   I want you to try it.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.360]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.320]   Click the try it free button.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.960]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.040]   And we thank Citrix for their support of this weekend tech.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.440]   So Bluetooth 4, the whole point of it, apparently,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.680]   according to bluetooth.com, is its low energy.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.040]   So you can have Bluetooth devices that operate for a long time.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.360]   They say months or years on the little lithium coin batteries.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.120]   So health care, sports, fitness applications, security, home
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.280]   entertainment.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.680]   You could have a security camera that
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.240]   has this little battery in it and then uses Bluetooth
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.920]   to connect.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.480]   Well, I think--
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   So that's what 4.0 is.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.760]   And it was just announced in July.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.720]   I mean, it's brand new.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.360]   And this week, we also saw Arm unveiling
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.720]   their low power chip that has--
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.960]   they're saying up to a year--
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.400]   it's going to extend devices up to a year of battery life.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   Forget 10 hours.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.240]   I want a year.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.400]   Right.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.000]   Well, I mean, it's just this whole internet of things idea.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.560]   And not only just creating them to be Wi-Fi internet,
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.880]   mesh networks within your home, all radiating around a device.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.240]   And gee, what would that device be?
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.560]   Do you have the Nike fuel?
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.080]   No, you have diamonds.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.680]   Never mind.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.760]   You know, has it--
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.120]   Sarah got it at South by Southwest.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.880]   I bet Joanna has one.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.520]   I do have it.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.600]   I'm not wearing it right now.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.320]   It's on the other side.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.280]   What do you think?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.640]   Compared to the up, what do you think?
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.680]   Well, I actually never tested the up,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.640]   and I'm kind of happy about that.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.720]   Yeah, that was a debacle.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.160]   So many problems.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.920]   They actually pulled it off the market.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.160]   I wore it at South by Southwest,
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.640]   and I couldn't believe how much I'd walked.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.040]   But I'm not a real fitness guru.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.360]   But it kind of--
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.040]   Becky Worley.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.480]   I love the Fitbit.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.800]   The Fitbit was fabulous.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   Fitbit has more features than the fuel.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.720]   But the fuel does something interesting.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.880]   It gives you this magic fuel points
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.720]   that are based on a variety of things.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.040]   So that's-- I see they're smart.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.520]   It's a surprise.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.600]   It's not calories.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.240]   Anybody can do calories.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   Right.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.600]   This is fuel.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.040]   Right.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.560]   And so by doing that, they own it a little bit more.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.840]   The thing I'm waiting for that is like everything else
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.680]   in this fitness category bore the hell out of me
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.840]   until they get the device that tells me my calorie consumption.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.920]   And your blood pressure and your heart rate.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.800]   It should just stick right there in your neck.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.760]   And just be a little probe.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.800]   It's just a little-- it's a slight prick.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.320]   Excuse me.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.280]   Just a little prick.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.560]   This is the women's show.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.600]   Just a tiny prick.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.240]   Keep your references away.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.680]   Any teeny we need.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   I'm just writing these all down over here.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.640]   And then it goes right in your throat.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.080]   Mine's fine.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.400]   I guess it could go in your buttocks.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.080]   Or a bust line.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   Or a bust line.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.600]   Where would be the best place if you
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.320]   were going to measure all that?
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.520]   It would have to be sort of like maybe one of these kind of--
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   A band?
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.120]   A band?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.840]   But you know, I remember when you got that Y thing scaling,
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.920]   you started tweeting your weight.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.200]   And I was like, that's insane.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.840]   And now I live and die off the Y thing scale
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.920]   because it tracks your weight.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.640]   It also works with my Zio's.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.480]   I have a Y thing's blood pressure cuff.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.160]   So I tweet my blood pressure.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.320]   It's excellent.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:31.800]   Excellent.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.240]   It's a little bit exhibitionistic.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.320]   I don't know if it's a really--
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.760]   I think it's kind of an abnormal thing to do.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.200]   It's the quantification of your personal life.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.000]   I mean, there's much to--
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.440]   I tried to get Kelly Rippa to do it
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.200]   and she wouldn't step on the scale.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.000]   I mean, I think this Bluetooth thing is a big deal
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.120]   because basically what it comes down to is it's all
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.960]   about battery life.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.800]   If you have devices that are constantly searching
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.000]   and you get longer battery life once that radio
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   is mellows out a little bit, then I
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.040]   think that's going to be a big deal.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.080]   Well, except for a long time, we're
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.520]   making all of these improvements in these devices.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.680]   And there's been very few breakthroughs in batteries.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.440]   And you really need--
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.680]   I mean, somebody was saying I was it on the verge somewhere
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.160]   that these new phones are going to be starting to be less than six
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.400]   or seven hours.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.960]   That's not going to make it.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.460]   Right.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.440]   So that's stopping innovation completely in its tracks.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.000]   And it's not just in gadgets.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.720]   I mean, this is the inhibitor for obviously electric cars.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   It's the size and the capacity and the refresh.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   What do you use to describe how it takes less charge every time?
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.560]   I have a lot.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.160]   That thing in terms of batteries with cars.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.440]   So I'm with you.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.680]   Is that true that in the lithium-ion battery
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.760]   packs in electric cars, you're actually
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.280]   losing capacity each time?
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.160]   I don't know certainly.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.840]   But I know that that's-- as far as I know,
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.400]   universal to batteries.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.720]   I don't know how it plays out in cars.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.480]   So I will-- I'm sure about everything,
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.760]   but I'm going to keep my mouth shut for just a moment.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.360]   I think it's pretty much a cliff effect.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.760]   It might be something that's small amount.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.480]   But I think it's pretty much after 500 charges,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.760]   it just stops working, as opposed to slowly degrading.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.840]   Battery degradation, the chat room says.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.800]   Or attrition for more militaristic.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.600]   So Denise Howell--
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.440]   Hang on a quick.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.600]   I get this call.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.320]   Adriana calls me from Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.840]   She says, my neighbor has a really horrible name
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.280]   for their Wi-Fi access point.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.160]   And every time I pull it up, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.200]   And people come over, and my mom wants to use the Wi-Fi.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   And I give her the name, but you see it in the dropdown menu.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.240]   You can't avoid it.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.200]   There it is.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.700]   I don't know.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.880]   And I couldn't get her to say it on the air.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.560]   She probably couldn't say it on the air.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.040]   And she said--
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   I said-- you've talked to your neighbor.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.480]   She said, yeah, they said, no, we're not going to change it.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.760]   She went to the Homeowners Association.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.560]   And I don't think it's in the C&C.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.720]   It's not in the contract that you can't put up an antenna.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.240]   You can't paint your house purple,
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.000]   but you can have a foul name Wi-Fi access point.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.560]   Is there any legal recourse?
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.960]   You know, I can't think of any kind of legal recourse for that.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.400]   It becomes a speech issue, right?
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.560]   It's something you're broadcasting that
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.400]   has some meaningful content to you, I suppose,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.440]   if they're not going to take it down, it does.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.720]   So it becomes a question of what sort of public speech is--
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.000]   Well, good sounds that it's--
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.400]   It's impossible in that location.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.480]   It's an FCC issue.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.920]   She could get the FCC to find them.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.960]   So it becomes like Janet Jackson's nipple.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.360]   And in fact, for all I know, that's actually the name of it.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.520]   Janet Jackson's nipple.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.840]   From dying to opening.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.560]   That's the name of the nipple.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.600]   Yeah, don't you want to know?
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.640]   SSID malfunction.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.160]   Anyway, don't do that, folks.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.720]   We actually had a funny discussion on Twill.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.840]   I was trying to pull up exactly the names
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.160]   of the networks in question.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.760]   But I think it was triggered.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.720]   I was in an airport and was surfing for the way to connect.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.920]   And there was an SSID available that was like,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   we will hack you blind or just something--
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.420]   Right.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:15.920]   Those are good.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.320]   It's currently threatening.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.520]   Mashable had an article on Mashable's favorite Wi-Fi names.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.360]   They actually asked people to write in.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.040]   Police surveillance van 2.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.120]   Use this one, Mom.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:32.920]   That's good.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.320]   Abraham Linksis.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.560]   Oh, that's-- I'm looking at one on Huffle.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.800]   I'm under your bed.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.200]   I'm in the house.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.400]   Please bring vodka to apartment 1310.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.040]   This is good.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.400]   I'll use the nice one.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.960]   Your dog poops in my yard.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.040]   Maybe that's what it is.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.480]   That's a public service.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.800]   That's preventing violence.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.520]   All of your bandwidth belong to us.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.080]   Anyway, I have a feeling this is a 21st century issue.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.800]   It's passive aggressive, neighbor to neighbor.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.680]   Well, they always said good fences make good neighbors.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.720]   One of those associations in CCNRs,
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   I mean, that would certainly be--
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.800]   You have to point that one on air.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.360]   --a starting point.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.200]   There are some things that are not OK in gated communities
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.640]   that would be OK on a public street.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.880]   This is a good one.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.480]   Tell us this one.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   The best one so far.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.880]   Your baby is really ugly.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.120]   That's not passive aggressive.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.280]   That's aggressive aggressive.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.600]   Wow.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.800]   Mine's not well-done.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.680]   No.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.640]   Wow.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   But Joanna, you live in the city.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.240]   I mean, there's probably 1,000 Wi-Fi access points whenever
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.600]   you--
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.120]   There are.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.800]   There really are.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   What are you doing?
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   I don't know if these are all that interesting.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   Are you taking a picture?
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.720]   Oh, you're looking at your neighbors.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   Nice.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.920]   I think we're actually--
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.600]   and I bet you that our audience will be the first to notice
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.160]   this, but we're actually getting to a point where
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.760]   there are too many Wi-Fi access points.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.680]   There's 11 bands, but there's really only three effective
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.520]   bands.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.840]   There's kind of high, medium, and low.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.440]   And if you get a lot of traffic in any of those bands,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.560]   we actually have it here.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.840]   And the reason I'm aware of this in the Twit Brickhouse,
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.040]   because we have so many Wi-Fi access points in Pixelcore,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.520]   which shares our space, does, that we have a lot of collisions.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.760]   We can't find free space.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.920]   We are completely occupying the 2.4 gigahertz range.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.040]   And I suspect that this is going to be--
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.760]   I mean, Joanna, how many do you see there?
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.280]   20 different Wi-Fi access points?
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.720]   But a ton of them, right?
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.640]   In any major city, it's a lot.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.440]   15, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 19, 21.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.040]   21.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.600]   21.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.760]   And the thing is, there are only three bands.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.840]   And so if they're all nearby and strong, what you're going to get--
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.920]   and by the way, this is one of the reasons why we tell people not
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.920]   to use Wi-Fi and Skype is you're going to get this.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.120]   One of the reasons I--
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.200]   And you've already experienced it.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:01.880]   You dropped out.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.560]   And it's because of all these collisions.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.280]   Have you used this Wi-Fi stumbling that tells you what channel
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.400]   all your neighbors are on?
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.200]   And I use one on Android Wi-Fi analyzer.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.520]   And it's very useful.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.880]   It's funny when the cable guy came into my house
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.240]   to saw the cable, I had a couple of routers out.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.040]   I had a new Apple Airport extreme,
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.960]   and I had a Linksys router that sent me.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.400]   And the cable guy even said, you're not
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.040]   going to use that Linksys, are you?
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.280]   So when I was going to use the app,
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.400]   I said, oh, you use the Apple.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.480]   It's much better.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.120]   Said, well, ought to be.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.320]   It's four times more expensive.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:33.840]   Yep.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.320]   Right.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   I think I'm used to getting a Linksys.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.120]   That's another problem.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.400]   How's that working for you?
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.320]   You see me right now?
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.560]   So what is the availability on the iPad?
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.720]   It seems like-- has anybody--
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   I mean, I know if you order online, it says two weeks, right?
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.040]   But I think you can walk into an Apple store today
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.640]   and just say, I'll take one, right?
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.360]   And Walmart.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:54.840]   That's Walmart.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.400]   Walmart?
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.080]   Target?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.920]   Have you done that recently?
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.840]   I've been hearing about any sellouts in New York, at least.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.480]   So does that mean-- means one of two things.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.440]   Either Apple learned and they made them,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.120]   started making them earlier, or the demand is lighter.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.920]   Right.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.240]   And I mean, I'm hoping we hear some numbers on this call
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.200]   tomorrow morning, but it doesn't-- it seems like this is
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.800]   really going to be about their financial standing.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.280]   So--
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   I love this.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.120]   --so give you when they announce some numbers.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.200]   So we have to get up on the--
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.760]   it's a 9am call in New York.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.200]   We have to get up at 6am here in California.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.640]   Apple's done this to us twice now.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.440]   I can do it with you, because I'm going to be talking about how
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.160]   to exercise your way through your housework at 4am.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.440]   A GM, you do those live.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:37.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.920]   Yeah, she does them live.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.420]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.760]   From your house via Skype.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.160]   My dread fears, my kids will wake up in the middle of my
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.320]   live shot and walk out.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.800]   [YELLING]
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.280]   Now I'd like to show you how I get exercised by beating my
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   children.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.960]   Look at what anti-robin and Uncle George do not want to
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   talk to you.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.320]   Oh, that's Stephanopoulos.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.440]   He's such a taskmaster.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.840]   Lenovo has announced, and this is from The Verge.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.280]   Do you miss The Verge a little bit?
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.960]   Joanna, come on.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.160]   I do miss them, but they're all great guys, and I see them
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.080]   very frequently.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   I had breakfast this morning with Neela Patel himself.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.680]   Oh, I love Neela.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.320]   He's so great.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.480]   Keep in touch with everyone.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.000]   Good.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.720]   Now, can I ask one quick question?
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.760]   Was The Design of The Verge website done in conjunction
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.360]   with Windows 8?
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.200]   It is a tablet design, isn't it?
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.720]   I mean, it is uncanny.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.560]   Go back to the metro.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.400]   I'm not going to comment on this, but no, I'm going to say
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.960]   no.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.440]   OK.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.880]   I just wondered if it was just me who was making this
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.160]   observation.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.760]   That's a really interesting point.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.120]   I see the tile type of effect.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.440]   Well, the colors.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.120]   Tiles are hot right now.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.640]   Tiles are hot.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.000]   We were in production way before Apple--
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.040]   I mean, Apple, Microsoft previewed their Windows 8.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.920]   I feel like that's a comment.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.440]   All right.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.640]   Thank you.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.160]   It is.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:57.960]   That's a prepared comment.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.440]   It is.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:58.880]   That's all right.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.360]   Wait till we talk about the Yahoo story.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.320]   I'll be awfully quiet.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.480]   Because you're still doing stuff for them?
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.480]   Interesting.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.880]   OK, and we'll talk about that.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.920]   So Lenovo says they, according to The Verge,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.200]   are going to be the first to market with a Windows 8 tablet.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   Michael Dell said--
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:16.960]   Can I have a little second?
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.280]   Well, that's what's weird, because it says Lenovo.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.960]   But then the first sentence is, Michael Dell says he'll
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.680]   have an enterprise tablet.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.960]   The day, the exact day, Windows 8 ships.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.680]   But Lenovo is also saying--
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.920]   I don't mean to call Sean, who wrote this article.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.000]   It's a great reporter.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.640]   But I want to say that all the major PC manufacturers
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.000]   will have Windows 8 tablets and PCs the first day
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.160]   that Windows 8 is available.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.000]   You'd be crazy not to.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.240]   You've got a little bit of lead time.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.400]   Microsoft has done that with almost every release.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.280]   If you were think back to Windows 7,
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.320]   there were halo products that were announced that same day
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.240]   Steve Bomber took stage here in New York
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.440]   and said Windows 7 is available now.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.880]   Look at these brand new PCs.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.280]   Right.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.560]   And also corresponds well with the refresh cycle
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.920]   for a lot of these PC manufacturers.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   In fact--
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.160]   So I believe Lenovo will have one of the first.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.040]   In fact, PC manufacturers are--
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.480]   they live for this time.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.840]   Sales go through the roof when there's
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.800]   a new version of Windows.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.880]   They would love Microsoft to do what Apple does
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.120]   and release whenever you're-- in fact, Microsoft kind of implied
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.880]   that they are going to start doing that, starting with Windows 8.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   And I'm sure that that's driven somewhat by the hardware
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.640]   market that says, please.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.720]   They practically put the hardware market out of business
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.680]   with Vista because it was so delayed.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.640]   And these companies knew every business
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.400]   is waiting for the new operating system.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.720]   And they're not buying new hardware.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.760]   Yeah, but consumers are only buying every other year
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.840]   because we all know the every other release cycle from Microsoft
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.120]   is a dud, me, the odd release.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.760]   TikTok is actually everywhere.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.880]   Intel says we do a TikTok.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.040]   Apple's obviously doing a TikTok with its iPhone.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.440]   The 4 was a big revolution, 4s incremental, 5 probably
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.000]   big revolution.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.240]   That makes sense because you've got two year contracts
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.320]   with the cell phone companies, at least in the US.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.480]   It's different internationally.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.640]   Those darn ferners, they ruin everything.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.040]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.400]   you see all these major manufacturers and their CEO
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.640]   saying, Windows 8, Windows 8.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.400]   So you've got Lenovo, whoever this source is right now,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   you've had Meg Whitman saying the same thing for HP.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.720]   You've seen Michael Dell saying it now for Dell.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.160]   I mean, all of these guys, ASUS has also said it
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.400]   that they're like the number one partner for Windows 8
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.640]   when it comes to ARM.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.040]   So they're all going to have stuff that day or if not that
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.360]   week at Best Buy or wherever they launch.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.120]   And I think the TikTok cycle does not
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.840]   work with Windows this time because Windows 7 was
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.040]   absolutely the best version of Windows to date.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.200]   And Windows 8 is the most major refresh of Windows since
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.160]   Windows 95.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.000]   I mean, this is a huge, very invention.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.880]   So I saw it to see, yes.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.000]   Thought it looked great, got it, understand why it's going
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.720]   to be a big deal.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.960]   And what I'm really curious about is, have you guys seen it
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.480]   in tablet form and played with it in tablet form?
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:04.920]   I have.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.360]   But the developer preview, not the consumer preview.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.000]   So OK, here's my big question because everyone's talking
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.240]   about the iPad as a creative tool.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.120]   The iPad, create with it, fill shillers up there saying, oh,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.840]   yes, you can create.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.280]   I call total BS until they get application switching
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.080]   under control.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.680]   It's a debacle on the iPad for me.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   When I'm creating and I'm moving between applications
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.040]   on the iPad, I find it absolutely laborious.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.960]   Will Windows 8 in tablet form get application switching
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.560]   or multitasking down in a format that is better than the iPad?
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.400]   They already do.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.320]   And I actually wrote this in my review.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.280]   That would be coming up tomorrow.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.320]   And I'm trying to figure out how to drop in my link to my preview
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.400]   of the consumer preview someplace.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.800]   Are you in the chat room, Joanna?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.280]   Because you could put it there and I'll see it there.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.880]   If you're not, don't try to get in the chat room.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.400]   You could tweet it.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:53.800]   There we go.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.400]   There you go.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   Did it go through?
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.000]   I'll see.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.200]   So I took a very deep look at the consumer preview on a tablet
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.600]   that Microsoft sent me before it came out.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.400]   And the application switching is one of the things I love the most
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.560]   and what I actually wrote in my iPad review is that I hope when
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.160]   they do the software update later this year is that's sort
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.960]   of the schedule that Apple's been on, that they do address how apps
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.320]   work side by side and how they sort of address a little bit
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.240]   of the operating system to make it a little bit different
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.680]   than it's looked in the past.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.240]   And so when you are in Windows 8,
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.560]   you can drag apps in from the left or the right
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.760]   and then adjust how they appear on the side with a little bit
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.200]   of a slider thing.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.400]   And I just think the way they're doing apps
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.840]   and how they work with each other is pretty amazing.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.600]   I agree.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.920]   You know, basically on the Mac desktop now in Lion,
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.680]   that's how it works.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.520]   When you go full screen with an app,
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.760]   you can do a three finger, you could set it to four fingers
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.160]   swipe and you just slide.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.760]   It kind of reminds me of the Palm Pre where you're sliding
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.960]   from card to card.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.000]   Right, cards.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.560]   And so this is--
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.240]   you hit an interesting point because we are--
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.320]   Happens, have you answered one?
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   We are used to the idea of having multiple windows open
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   and being able to context switch programs even without sliding
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.440]   the screen just on the same screen.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.400]   And many of us have now got 27 inch or 30 inch screens
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.320]   for just that reason.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.000]   So we can have a browser open, a word processor open,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.920]   and we can cut and paste or we can go back and forth.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.240]   And tablets really don't do that.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.080]   And multitasking is really a myth on devices like this.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.320]   I don't think you really should even multitask
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.280]   on memory and processor constrained devices
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.800]   because you're looking at one thing at a time
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.920]   and you can context switch.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.960]   You don't need a fully multitask unless you're
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.240]   listening to Pandora or something.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.400]   But it is-- I think--
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.000]   so you have this issue.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.520]   You want to operate full screen.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.040]   Sorry.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.160]   I mean, just go with it before.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.680]   Come on.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.040]   You can have a low hot shirt make it work.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.520]   You guys are multitasking right now.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.960]   You can go right.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.280]   If you can-- God, if I can only swipe this window off,
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.680]   what's happening?
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.160]   It's all this like the--
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.880]   What's happening?
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.800]   What happened?
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.280]   I've got Joanna's article on her Skype.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.840]   Oh, and it has a big continent.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.960]   It has a big continent right there.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.160]   So there it is.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.920]   Damn you, ABC.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.960]   Damn you.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   Oh, no.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   Oh, oh.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.080]   So it's-- because you sent us in this Skype--
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.640]   Yeah, you sent us--
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.080]   You sent the link in the chat.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.080]   In the chat.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   Purple.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   I'm just saying.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   Really?
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   Sorry.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   She's wearing a purple shirt.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   She is.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   It's a chick thing.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.080]   It is.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   See, look at that.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   Purple.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   I got to wear purple on camera.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   I've just invested in like 15 new purple shirts.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   You know what?
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.080]   I have a bunch of purple too.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   Purple looks good on camera.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   You don't really know if you see my closet right now.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   Purple's good.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   Purple's good.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Thanks for going with it.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   We got dance bombed by the Cotton Council.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.680]   Anyway, so this is a video review.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.800]   Are you-- is this-- now this is not for TV.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.440]   This is for the web only?
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.080]   Yeah, this was the web only and actually-- well, they--
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   Is this something new that they're going to do?
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.200]   It's-- there's a whole complicated thing.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.640]   But yes, this is pulled for some of the TV stuff, but it actually-- it was also on Yahoo,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.160]   but mostly for web reviews, which is good because we get to do a good mix of length and
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   content which--
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   Right.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   Yeah, because--
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   Now I'm now working on--
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.360]   Maybe a two-minute piece on GMA.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360]   Right.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.360]   And because--
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   Oh, no, no, this would-- I could never--
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.160]   Well, they would never do this on GMA.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.160]   Right.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.360]   They would never do this on GMA, but even if they did, it would be for two minutes.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   Oh, minute 30.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   You're at 30.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.160]   That's where Becky and I are going to team up and we are going to push.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.360]   You will see the text.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.160]   So how long is this piece on the web?
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.000]   I think this actually turned out to be four minutes or so.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   There we go.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   So that's the app switching right now.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Cool.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Okay.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So it's almost like-- what's that thing when you snap?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Exactly.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.880]   They kind of started that with Windows Vista actually, the snap.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.560]   Well, but see, so-- okay, so what I was saying is, Lion does this, you can swoop back and
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   forth.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.160]   And I think that that is actually a very nice natural way to context which there will be
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.480]   lots of people who say, but no, I want two windows open side by side so I can look at
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.840]   them.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.120]   But guess what?
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.400]   The world's moving away from that.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.320]   It's moving to full screen apps and it's because of tablets.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.960]   And I think-- I guess we'll get used to it.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   Yeah, well, I just--
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   Yeah, and I don't--
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.120]   And I think they could totally do that on the iPad.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.840]   You could totally have an app, an app, an app.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   Yeah, or--
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   Does it do it already?
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.480]   Is that the-- that's that new multi-touch?
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   You have to enable the gestures.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.840]   Yeah, I was just going to say gestures would be the key because--
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   They have them.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   You have to enable them.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   And let me see if they're enabled on mine.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.840]   I probably didn't.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.960]   Yeah, multi-tasking gestures.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.600]   Use four or five fingers to pinch to the home screen, swipe up to reveal the multi-tasking
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.640]   bar, swipe left or right between apps.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.760]   So in fact, if I-- yeah, see?
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.760]   Look at that.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   So I am doing that.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.280]   It's not easy, but you can do that.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.200]   All right, well, that's definitely a step in the right direction because I think that
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.600]   the problem with creation in individual apps is that that doesn't reflect how people truly
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   create.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.520]   It's across many different apps and media sources.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.560]   And yet for novice users.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.840]   And I think that that's really where the conversation is happening here is that Microsoft
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:20.120]   and Apple have both decided that there is a far larger number of neophyte users who
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.400]   don't know how to use computers.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.600]   For them, it just makes sense.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:30.160]   One task at a time, occupy the full screen, have an intimate experience.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.240]   Then when you want to do something else, go there.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:36.920]   Well, but is it novice or is it that I consider the iPad to be a consumption tool?
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.400]   Well, I did too.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.400]   It isn't anymore.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   Right, okay.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   And that's what-- that's what to me.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.120]   iPad 3 changes the game or whatever that happens.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.640]   Because of the camera?
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.640]   Because of the-- it's a couple of things.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   Because of the camera.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.720]   Because of the camera, it's now creation device.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.360]   No, look what Apple's done.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   It's true.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.520]   I photo and then you see Avid Studio as well as iMovie.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   That's for sure true.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:01.440]   But they've also put voice dictation in which solves kind of the keyboard issue.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.280]   They've added Siri style voice dictation.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.360]   Androids had that for a while.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.320]   It does a very good job.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.880]   I think you're seeing a lot of apps.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:14.760]   It took a while for word processors, spreadsheets, presentation managers to adapt how
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.800]   they think to a touch world.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   And that was part of the problem.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   Are you going to do your taxes on that?
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   No, of course not.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   But I don't even do my taxes on any--
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   I thought you had to pull you in.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   I thought you had to do your taxes.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.400]   Are you going to do your taxes at all?
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.560]   I have someone do that.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.560]   Alerting the IRS.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   Leo is not doing taxes.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.280]   No, I just don't do them.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   I have somebody.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.800]   I have the whole stack of things.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.720]   But the person who does it does it on probably Excel without a desktop of course.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   Yes.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.720]   We will not be reinventing the wheel.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   No.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.320]   And Janice, probably in the law, it would be difficult to do pleadings and all that.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.200]   But on the other hand, you might instead of being a big briefing case to court, you
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.600]   might bring-- I guess you couldn't because you have to present--
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   Nobody used a briefing case.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.600]   You already did this.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   You do.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   The brief.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   It's a lawyer thing.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   A brief.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   They're called briefs.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   Aren't they?
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   Am I wrong?
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   They're called briefs.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   And you have a case.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   Okay.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   Put your briefs in the case.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   All right.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   We'll backtrack them.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   Or your shorts, whatever you got.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.600]   You put them in the case and you take them to court.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   But of course, you couldn't do this because how would you enter it in evidence or show
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.600]   it to the other attorney?
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.600]   You need paper.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   Oh, no.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.200]   You'd be stunned at how technological courtrooms are getting and how much things like iPads
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.600]   are used to have like PCs in general.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.920]   But yeah, are being used to do presentations for juries and the court in general.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.080]   That's true.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.440]   They set up a screen and they had a projector and they had a laptop and they showed movies
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.520]   and yeah, you're right.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.960]   The last time I was on a trial, you're right.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:37.440]   Although there was a lot of, I don't know how this works, bailiff and stuff like that.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.240]   There is a lot of that too, yes.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.760]   But I just don't.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:47.600]   If none of the app switching improvements convinced me that anybody's going to abandon
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.840]   their iPhone or their iPads that they've now come to love over a couple of years because
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.600]   something's going to app switch a little better.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   That's a good point.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.200]   The consumers have voted.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.920]   These things are successful.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   They are using them.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.440]   Are we going to bash NPR or not?
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   Okay.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.720]   So my days actually, but would it be all right if we went ahead and called and I said,
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   "I'm not going to get another guest?"
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.760]   Yes, actually we have another guest.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.160]   I'll tell you what.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   Let's get mad on the line.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.720]   Why are you getting mad on the line?
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   Okay.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   And then we'll do NPR.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   Don't let me forget my daisy because I would love to bash NPR.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   It's actually not NPR.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720]   I'm sorry, it's not.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   I'm not going to get my daisy on the line.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.480]   That was just throwing the red mean out.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.720]   Mike Daisy was a regular in the screen savers.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   We know Mike very well.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   I had no idea.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.440]   Mike, he moved to Seattle unfortunately, but I'll talk about that.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.560]   I think the world of him, he's a great guy, is very funny.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.560]   I can't wait to hear you.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   We'll talk about what happened.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.280]   First, let's talk about fresh books and then we're going to get Matt Speccarelli on the
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   line.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   You know that name?
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   Yes, I do.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   You know who I'm talking about?
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   Yes, you do.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.280]   $935 richer.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.280]   $835.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   Oh, I think it was more than he...
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   Well, let's find out.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.640]   We got the horse on and we'll get it from his mouth in a moment.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.920]   But first, let's...
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   No snickering.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.520]   First, let's talk about easy online invoicing.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:04.040]   If you're a small business, the worst thing is the end of the month because you guys
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   send out invoices.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.280]   In fact, I always would forget you agree with me.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.800]   You're saying it is, right?
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.960]   I thought you were saying something about the end of the month and it being a women show.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   Oh my God.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.960]   We weren't going there.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   We want going to talk about that.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   Joanna Stern.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   Fresh books is definitely not going to be happy with this.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   Go on.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.960]   Go on.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.000]   Please forgive my younger colleague at ABC.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.480]   You'll be springtime fresh with fresh books.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.800]   Online invoicing for those special times of the month.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.440]   The last five days of the month.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.200]   It's the worst time because you have to do your invoices.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   Hey, it headaches.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   And if you get headaches, you get cranky, you get bloated.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.720]   You get to have a chocolate during this time.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.520]   You eat a lot of chocolate because it's these dang invoices.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.360]   Here's the problem.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.440]   If you don't send them out, what happens?
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.680]   Oh, it's a mess.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.840]   It's a mess.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.400]   You don't get paid.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.400]   Oh.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   What were you thinking?
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.400]   You don't get paid.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.040]   And this is the problem I have because I used to put it off.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.760]   And then six months later, I didn't voice the company.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   I said, "Were you crazy?
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.920]   I'm not going to pay you for something six months ago."
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   You got to send them out regularly.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.520]   So what Fresh books does is so nicely.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   You do it via email.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   You're very professional.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   You upload your logo and everything.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.560]   So it's a real invoice.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:28.680]   And what happens is there's a button on the email that says, "Pay him now."
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.240]   And I'll tell you, most clients will do that because it's not that they don't want to
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   pay you right away.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.400]   It's just as much a pain for them as it was for you invoicing.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   They put it off.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.760]   So this way, they click the button.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.320]   They can use a credit card.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:45.160]   They can use PayPal or I think there's 11 online payment services they can choose from.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.160]   And you get paid fast.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.960]   You can even automate this whole process if you want, if your client wants, so that
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   the invoicing is automatic.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.720]   The payment is automatic.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.800]   If you do time and hours, they have apps on the iPhone and they have a web app that
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.080]   will automatically take the time and hours and put it in the invoice, send it out.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   And then you can send it out to the email app.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.080]   They send it out to the email app.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   You can have these.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   >> If you do me a favor and mention that you heard this on Twitter, I would be very brief.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   Fresh books, easy online invoicing.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:05.080]   >> Leo, the chat room has a question that special offer?
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   >> Yes.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   >> Any strings attached?
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   >> We've decided to create a string free fresh books.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   >> Got it.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Okay.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   Second show.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   I'm just representing the needs of the chat room.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   >> That was amazing.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   >> Don't blame the chat, you thought that one up.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   >> You know it was you.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   I had your back.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   >> Oh my god.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   >> I think I just did a tampack set.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   I didn't even know.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.080]   Pretty pretty.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   >> I didn't even know.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   >> I'm very sorry.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   I apologize to the viewers.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   I'm new on the show.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.080]   >> No, we love it.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   Just take off your top and everything will be fine.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   All right.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.080]   So moving on, that didn't go over so well.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   >> Not too long.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.080]   >> Could you edit that part out?
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080]   Thank you.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   I tried.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   I really did.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.080]   I was going to be good this whole show.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   And then Warley started.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   It's all her fault.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   Mike Daisy is a monologist.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.080]   Do we have Matt on the line?
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   >> I think we might.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.080]   Matt?
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   >> Matt, are you there?
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   >> I'm here.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.580]   >> So Matt is a modern day hero, ladies and gentlemen, a Robin Hood, a man who takes from
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.080]   the rich and puts it in his pocket.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   Matt, what did you do?
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   >> Well, I sued AT&T.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   And that's not the big story.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   The big story is that I beat him.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   >> He took him to small claims court.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.580]   Matt's the guy you probably read about who a couple of weeks ago had his day in court
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:35.580]   and then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:40.580]   And then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:45.580]   And then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.580]   And then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.580]   And then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.580]   And then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   And then he was just a little bit like a bitch.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.580]   >> You know, you told us on the radio show, but if you don't mind repeating it a little
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:06.580]   bit, the judge seemed to be, he kind of, he was kind of leaning your way.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.580]   >> Yeah, at first he wasn't.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:13.580]   I mean, it was definitely an argument, definitely a case that we had to fight with, you know,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.580]   fight with each other about with the judge.
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:21.580]   But towards the end of the conversation, that's when I realized it was going my way.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:27.580]   Because he took the time to give us both a lecture about how justice actually happens in small
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.580]   claims court, where, you know, you don't get all the litigation and the attorneys and
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:32.580]   the attorney's fees.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:38.580]   It's one time going to the clerk's office filling out some paperwork that takes for less than
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.580]   10 minutes.
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:42.580]   And before you leave, you have a court date.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.580]   And I mean, that's, it's quick justice.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.580]   It's simple.
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.580]   It's very cost effective.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.580]   You get it done real quick.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:55.580]   >> So the AT&T said in a guy, I mean, they can't use a lawyer.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.580]   >> Yeah, that's correct.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:02.580]   They sent the area representatives who manages seven of the local stores.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.580]   And I assume that, you know, he's got to be taught what to do.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   They had a paralegal helping them.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:13.580]   And he did bring up some good points, but, you know, some of his points just, it just
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   didn't make any sense to the judge.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   >> So the judge said, you know what?
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   You're right.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:25.580]   Awarded you $85 per month for the 10 months.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.580]   Is that how it worked?
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:31.580]   >> Yeah, they, in small claims, they can't do injunctive relief, which is getting the
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   policy changed, which is the whole idea.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   So they can only give you your damages.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.580]   So he said, what's your average?
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:40.580]   I said about 10 gigs.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.580]   And how much is left on your contract?
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.580]   10 months.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.580]   So he asked me how much it would cost.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.580]   I said it's about $100.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.580]   It's $10 a gig.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.580]   And the AT&T guy said, well, he's already paying for a certain many under his plan of
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.580]   unlimited.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.580]   So he called it 65.
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:59.580]   The AT&T representative called it 65.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.580]   I called it 100.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.580]   The judge says I'm putting it in 85.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.580]   That's in the middle.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.580]   That's fair.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.580]   85 bucks times 10 months is $850.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.580]   >> AT&T, they're all little hissy fit.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:18.580]   They go, you know what I wish I could have could have remembered what the guy did.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.580]   I was so happy that I won.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.580]   And I, all I saw was his behind as he left the corner of the corner.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.580]   >> He stomped three times and disappeared in a greasy puff of smoke.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.580]   >> He disappeared so quickly.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   There was a guy there trying to get his name and information.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]   >> No, no.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.580]   Oh, yeah, you, you were smart because you called the AP before your day in court, right?
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.580]   You had that reported there.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.580]   >> Yeah, I was really just trying to do some research because I kept reading these stories
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:46.580]   and I wanted some advice and help and maybe learn some of the terminology like backhaul
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.580]   and HSPA plus, which now that I've learned.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   So I sent some emails and feelers and the guy from the AP called me back, you know, before
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.580]   court.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.580]   So I said, yeah, I already got a court date.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.580]   And he's like, well, can we send someone down?
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:00:59.580]   I'm like, yeah, sure.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.580]   >> Why not?
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.580]   >> You know, I didn't think it was going to be this, this huge story that it became.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.580]   >> Your cause, celebrity.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.580]   So AT&T said we're appealing.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.580]   >> Yeah, that's what they said.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.580]   >> But they didn't.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   >> No, Friday they sent me a check.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:21.580]   It was planned out really well, I think, because my attorney was telling me that he had a conversation
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   with their representation.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:28.580]   And before I even got off the phone with him, I got a call from the Associated Press saying,
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.580]   hey, did you check your mail?
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:33.580]   We hear that they mailed you a check today.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.580]   And I said, no, they curried it over because they wanted it in before five on Friday.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.580]   And I think they do that because of the news cycle.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.580]   >> Right.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.580]   >> Right.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.580]   So if I could, I would give you a high five.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.580]   >> Nice.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.580]   >> So, so a couple of questions.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.580]   What are you going to spend the money on?
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.580]   >> You know, I was thinking about that.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.580]   I think I'm just going to give it to a nonprofit thing called For the Need.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.580]   >> That's great.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.580]   >> But then, you know, I mean, $850 is not going to make or break me.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   And it wasn't about their money anyway.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.580]   So, you know, for the need, you know, they can definitely use it.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.580]   >> Aren't you a good guy?
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.580]   Are they still throttling you to set a curiosity?
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.580]   >> Yeah, they're still throttling me.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.580]   You know, it's a pain in the butt.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.580]   But, you know, and a lot of people bring up this whole tethering issue, you know.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:26.580]   Oh, well, he was stealing from AT&T because he tethered his phone.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   >> Well, didn't you get a cease and desist from them?
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580]   >> No.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.580]   >> What?
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.580]   >> To stop tethering?
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.580]   >> What they did is they said, we caught you tethering.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.580]   So, they switched me to a tiered plan for one month.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.580]   >> And during that tiered plan, I used the least amount of data and it cost me the most amount of money.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.580]   >> Yeah, of course.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.580]   >> And that was a good piece of evidence in court.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580]   >> Oops.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.580]   >> They showed the judge.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.580]   I'm like, look, I mean, this is costing me more money on a tiered plan.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.580]   But I complained to AT&T and they actually changed me back to unlimited.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.580]   So, okay, you know, all right, fine.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.580]   I won't do it anymore.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.580]   As long as this court thing is going on.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.580]   >> So, we had had the story on TNT.
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.580]   And maybe we got this wrong.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:09.580]   That they had said, we could change all this if you just shut up.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   >> Okay.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.580]   No, they sent me a letter and they were claiming that I reached out to them and I said, no,
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   they contacted me about a settlement talk.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:25.580]   So, what happened was, apparently, the day before court sent me a letter saying, basically,
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.580]   you better drop your case because you don't stand a chance.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   And that came at 4.30 pm the day before court.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.580]   After I went in court, I waited a couple days, let things kind of cool down, and I called
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.580]   her up and she took my call because she didn't recognize the phone number, I guess.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.580]   And I just simply asked her two questions.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.580]   I said, are you going to pay me or are you going to appeal?
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.580]   If you're not going to appeal, when can I get a check?
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.580]   She said that the corporate department is handling it now.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.580]   She's got nothing to do with it.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:59.580]   But after I get a judgment, to email her a copy of it, and she would put me in touch with
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.580]   whom I could ask those questions to.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.580]   So, I did that and then I called her two or three times and sent at least two, maybe three
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.580]   emails, and she never responded to me.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.580]   So, I said, okay, well, I'm just going to have to wait and see what time brings if they're
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580]   going to appeal or not.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   >> Right.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.580]   >> But just because they told the press doesn't mean they're going to.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:23.580]   So, after that, I was just going to let it lie, and then I got a call from Mr. Jason
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.580]   Frank of Egan Avenetti, which is a prestigious law firm that does nothing but class action
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.580]   lawsuits and huge litigation.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.580]   >> Oh, they would like you to start a class.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:41.580]   >> When he told me that he was hired by AT&T to represent them in this case, it once said
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.580]   to me that they're no longer using their legal department.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.580]   They're going to outside counsel.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   And he asked me if I was represented.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:54.580]   And at the time I wasn't, and he starts saying, yeah, I asked them the same questions.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.780]   I'm like, when do I get a check?
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.780]   And are you guys going to appeal?
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:03.220]   And he says, listen, anytime we talk to anybody about any kind of case that's pending, it's
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.580]   customary for a mutual non-disclosure agreement.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   >> A mutual non-disclosure agreement.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.580]   >> Right.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.580]   And I said, okay, I'll tell you.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.580]   >> Let me ask your counsel here, Denise Howell, is that typical?
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.140]   >> Oftentimes, especially when you're dealing with a big company like AT&T, if they're going
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:24.180]   to settle a case like this, they are going to want you to agree not to talk about it.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:25.980]   And those agreements generally are mutual.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:26.980]   >> Okay.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980]   >> Denise, I have a quick question for you.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:30.180]   >> Yeah, but as long as you've got your counsel here, go ahead.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.420]   >> And I have a question for you too.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.060]   So let's fire him back and forth.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:37.620]   >> Did I usually require you to sign one after you've won a judgment?
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.900]   Because I figured the settlement talks are supposed to happen before the judgment is
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:42.900]   done.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:47.900]   >> Oftentimes, settlements happen after you get a determination in your favor.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.500]   Because- >> But can't you just, you already won, though?
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.620]   >> They probably wouldn't have even talked to you without that determination in your
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.700]   favor, right?
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.180]   So now you at least have some leverage and they're going to come to the table.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.300]   >> Yeah, they didn't reach out to me a single time.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.740]   I mean, I sent my demand letter 30 days in advance, just like the contract says.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.300]   And I called customer service and asked them if they had a legal department and how I could
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   get in touch with them.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.780]   And they said, no, there isn't.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.340]   I called the executive resolution team and I actually spoke to someone there and she
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:23.540]   just, she's the reason why I decided to file it.
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.300]   But yeah, no one ever reached out to me.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.020]   I was always the one doing the calling.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:32.620]   And then when they give me this letter, and here's the thing, and I told them, I would
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.140]   absolutely sign that thing.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:37.060]   Let me run it by a friend of mine who's an attorney because I don't know about these
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.420]   things because he was talking about the mutual amount of disclosure agreement.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.020]   And it's a little over my head.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:47.660]   I mean, I think I can handle small claims, but the attorney guys definitely got one up on
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.660]   me.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:55.220]   So when I gave it to my friend and we read it together, all that stuff about, hey, we
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:59.540]   can terminate your service and all this didn't need to be in that letter.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.540]   And my intention was, hey, yeah, let's sign it and see what they have to say.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.900]   I mean, maybe they're going to offer me a ton more money, money just to shut up.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   But when they threw in the threat with it, it was like, okay, that's just way, put me
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.900]   over the edge.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.900]   You tweeted.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.900]   Right.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.700]   And the presentation in your case is a little bit different.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:22.260]   If you're going to settle a case, that's where the agreement to keep things confidential
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.060]   usually comes in as part and parcel of the settlement.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.180]   And NDA in advance is a little bit unusual.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.180]   And he won, right?
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.340]   So yeah, exactly.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.340]   Here's the tweet.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.220]   Looks like ATT is threatening to cut off my service.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:38.460]   If I don't set a sign of confidentiality agreement to talk about settling, I thought I won.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.460]   Mm hmm.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.500]   Hey, let me ask you this, Matt.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.780]   I just would love to be able to sit down like we're sitting down with you with the fellow
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.100]   that AT&T sent.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.260]   And I'm sure we're not going to have the chance to do that.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:57.900]   But when that person was there, did he attempt to make the argument on AT&T's behalf that
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:03.700]   you actually still were receiving unlimited service, unlimited data, just get a throttled
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.700]   amount?
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.700]   Absolutely did.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.580]   And I'll also read you this real quick thing.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.780]   It says 1.3 in their contract.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.620]   This is, I don't know if you could see this very well, but this is what he brought to
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.620]   court.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.620]   That's the contract.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.740]   It's the contract, sure.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:25.500]   Double sided pages ended is 61 pages.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:33.220]   And it says, it says, "We may change any terms, conditions, rates, fees, expenses,
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:36.820]   or charges regarding your service at any time."
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.420]   Where's the contract in this?
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.340]   That to me says they could do whatever they want.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.620]   And he read that to the judge or had the judge read it.
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.380]   And the judge says, "What does that mean?
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:49.980]   Does that mean you can do whatever you guys feel like doing?"
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:50.980]   Yes.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980]   And he basically said, "Yes."
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.460]   And he says, "Listen, I don't think so.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:58.460]   This is basically where you're going to learn your lesson.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:02.180]   You cannot tell somebody that you're the fastest wireless network, that you're going
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.980]   to get unlimited service, and bury it somewhere in a 63 page contract.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.580]   Oops, unless we say otherwise."
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.580]   Right.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.580]   But I'm not quite going to the unless we say otherwise point.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.620]   Whether or not the whole contract is enforceable is another really good question that I think
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.060]   the judge was probably irked by.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:28.980]   But they have a valid point, I think, that if they're going to give you unlimited data,
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.580]   they didn't say anything about how fast you can pull that data down.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   That that wasn't guaranteed.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:34.580]   Yes, they did.
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.460]   But they did say exactly how fast you could pull that data down.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.460]   It's everywhere.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.460]   I mean...
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:44.260]   Well, they say as fast as, I think they have weasel words in there, don't they?
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.260]   No, they don't look.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.020]   No, no, they don't look at the commercials that you see all the time.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:53.300]   You see tons and tons of commercials about AT&T being the fastest wireless network.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.620]   And that goes to my point.
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.860]   That goes to my point of justifiable reliance.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.140]   If they're saying it over and over again, my Ferrari analogy, we all know a Ferrari will
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.740]   do 200 miles an hour.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.180]   But when you take it to the dealer for an oil change and you get it back and it only
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:11.980]   does 45 miles an hour, you're going to wait a minute.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.980]   Hold on a second.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:13.980]   Hey, it still goes.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:22.020]   We're kind of crossing into the territory here though of not the contract but the advertising.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.020]   Right.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.780]   Which unfortunately though they should go hand in hand.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.740]   But advertising is not an implied contract in these with the customers.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.100]   If they say we're the fastest, that doesn't really mean that they have to be.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:34.100]   There's no.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.660]   Doesn't mean there's a degree of referee that.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:42.500]   Did it used to be illegal to lie in ads or is that just my imagination?
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.460]   You can't make specific promises and ads and then not keep them but you can talk about
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.140]   general stuff.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.140]   Right.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.780]   The kind of issues.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.500]   Fastest is not a quantifiable.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   Exactly.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.420]   But if they guarantee the contract guaranteed a certain speed, you're going to have unlimited
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.500]   data not just up to you but at a certain level.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.380]   Well, they're not dumb.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.620]   They're not going to write that down.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.620]   No, of course not.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:11.820]   They may have 61 pages but I guarantee you there's no words in there about a minimum
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.420]   speed or anything.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:18.220]   Lea, I would encourage you to look up the concept of justifiable reliance.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.740]   It's really important I think in the California legal system.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:26.340]   And once I started talking about that and giving the examples and showing the advertisements
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:33.460]   all over AT&T's website about the speeds at which 4G is four times faster than 3G and
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.740]   LTE is 10 times faster than this one.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.620]   That's when I think that I really won the case.
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.260]   That's when the judge really seemed to look like, "Wait a minute."
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:48.220]   And then the point also that the judge made during the decision was you can't tell him
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:53.860]   that he's going to have the fastest wireless network and then slow him down and then say
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:58.020]   unless he pays more because the guy said that to the judge.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.700]   He said if he is upset about the speeds, he's more than happy to go to a tiered plan which
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.220]   never gets slowed down and the judge really got upset with that one too.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.780]   He's like, "Wait, so now you're telling him he can go faster?
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.380]   He can get unlimited?
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.380]   As long as he pays for it?"
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:18.300]   All right, Matt, I'm so glad we're going to run along because we've got a ton of other
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.300]   stuff.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.300]   But I just congratulations.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.300]   I'm glad you got the check.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.380]   I think it's really honorable that you're going to give it to charity.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.740]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:28.420]   The last time we talked, you said you were going to help your brother do this.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.260]   Are you going to set up a business?
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:36.820]   No, I actually took a couple of phone calls this morning from some people in the Los Angeles
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:37.820]   area.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.460]   I'll go to court with them for free.
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.540]   The point of this isn't the money.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.180]   It's just give us what we pay for.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.780]   It's what we said that we were going to get.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.660]   It's the right thing to do.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.900]   It's great to talk to you again, Matt.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:49.900]   Thank you for joining us on Twitter.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:50.900]   Thank you for having me.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.900]   I really appreciate it.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.740]   Matt Spackarelli, who got his check yesterday or a day before yesterday for nine.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.740]   You're right.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740]   935.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.740]   Why 935?
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.740]   Why'd you get the answer?
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.740]   $85 for court costs.
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:01.740]   Oh, that was nice.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.740]   Here's the tip.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.740]   Keep it.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.140]   This is like Xerox costs.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.940]   Thanks, Matt.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:07.940]   Congratulations.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.100]   Thank you very much.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.100]   That's Matt Spackarelli.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.100]   That's for him.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.100]   Yeah, I think he's kind of a...
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.420]   He's fighting the fight.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:19.780]   Whether you can go back and forth about justifiable reliance and contract law and all of that.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:27.420]   But he's fighting just for the justice, the fairness of it.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:33.580]   And yeah, AT&T might have found some legal justice, but we're talking just being fair.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:39.080]   We really should mention too that AT&T won a big case before the US Supreme Court last
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:49.140]   year having to do with a different issue under its mobile contract with users and whether
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.180]   it was going to be able to bar users from bringing class action lawsuits under
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.900]   that contract, whether it's arbitration clause was going to be enforceable because it purported
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:13:59.900]   to do that.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.180]   Two courts in California said no way.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.140]   Consumers have to be able to bring class actions.
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.740]   The Supreme Court said no.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.140]   You can bar those class actions.
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:14.660]   So this small claims case that Matt brought is important because if he can get a ground
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:21.300]   swell of support of people to do this, it could take the place of a big class action.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.460]   It doesn't cost much though.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.060]   I'm AT&T, 935 bucks big deal.
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:27.900]   As long as there's not a lot of these.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.900]   Right.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:33.140]   I mean, who knows how widespread this idea will be kept.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:36.700]   It's bad, but I think more it's bad publicity.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.940]   It's not the money.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.660]   It's the bad publicity.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.180]   Make a go away, sign the NDA, end of story, something else.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.220]   That's what they would have liked to have done.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.900]   And Matt did not go for it.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:46.900]   I'm glad that.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:47.900]   He played it very well.
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:48.900]   He played it very savvy.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.060]   I didn't ask him if he wanted to be a lawyer.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.980]   It sounds like he's getting ready.
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.540]   Would you encourage that Denise?
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.540]   Absolutely.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.100]   Yeah, he did a good job.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   All right.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.780]   Now we'll talk about Mike Daisy after this word for model.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780]   How about that?
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.780]   That's great.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.820]   And I just want to say going back that the chat room does say they will never forget
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.020]   fresh books.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.700]   So just in case.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.700]   No strings attached.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.180]   I did it so deeply ingrained in their mind.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.180]   Thirty days free trial.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.740]   I will not do the same for Audible.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.900]   I will keep my mouth shut as of right this morning.
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:22.980]   If you could find a way to make Audible just as unforgettable, go for it.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.660]   I could say I would keep my mouth shut.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.700]   No, Joanna, please don't.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.180]   Let's find something here.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:31.300]   Actually Audible, we don't have to make Audible unforgettable.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.300]   People remember Audible because we talk about it a lot.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.740]   We just are huge fans.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:37.820]   It's the ultimate audio bookstore.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.900]   Over a hundred thousand titles now.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.020]   They do this every year during March Madness.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:46.540]   They do a bracket of audio books, your favorite audio books.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:50.060]   So it's the fifth annual tournament of audio books.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:55.100]   If you've been watching our Audible ads and you've got an Audible account, you can participate
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.100]   in this.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:01.540]   What they do is they have matchups and you can decide, well, was Solaris the definitive
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.020]   edition better than my dog Tulip?
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.260]   Rules of civility versus the psychopath test.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.620]   So you get this is really great.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.620]   And then they have the picks and the picks.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:16.220]   And at the end, we'll find out what the best, what the winner is between customer favorites,
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.700]   critical acclimation and bestsellers.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.220]   And you can use this.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.220]   Use the customer favorites.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:24.500]   The wives man's fear versus helter, scalter, the night circus.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:30.740]   This is silly, but really a lot of what this is about is helping you find great books because
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.340]   the problem with Audible, there are too many choices.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.820]   A hundred thousand books.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:41.180]   Now I'm going to get you your first book, actually your first two books free, but that's only
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.980]   two out of a hundred thousand.
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.020]   Susan Sarandon doing the member of the wedding.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.620]   See, then that would be awesome.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.620]   Awesome.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.620]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.140]   Anne Hathaway and the Wizard of Oz.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.340]   These are all Audible readers.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.420]   And this is one of the things that makes Audible so spectacular.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.820]   The great readers.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:01.140]   You've heard Samuel L. Jackson go the F to sleep.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.380]   He is riveting.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.780]   He also did a rage in Harlem.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:08.500]   There's Kate Winslet performing Terez Rekka.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.140]   Just it's really fantastic.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.380]   These are all great Audible, Audible performances.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.020]   And that's kind of what I want to emphasize.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.260]   Yes, you're getting the book.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:21.260]   Every word that's in the book, they have a dramatic reading of the AT&T customer contract.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:24.900]   All 61 books that is unbelievable.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:25.980]   You've just got to hear it.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   It just comes to life.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:31.260]   Not only they have great performances, but great books with all the words, but great
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.020]   performances by great actors.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   And that's what brings these to life.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.500]   I'm listening to the Song of Ice and Fire.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:41.780]   Book Two is the clash of kings before the HBO series comes out next month.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.340]   I'm going to finish it.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.420]   And it's Roy Dautrice just brings these characters to life.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.860]   It's like you're hearing this movie in your head.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:54.940]   And I just cannot tell you how wonderful Audible is.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:55.940]   Here's the deal.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:02.660]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, the number two, you'll sign up for the platinum account.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.460]   The first months for your first two books are for you.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.260]   You can cancel at any time and keep those books, so you don't have to pay any money.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.340]   The two books a month is what I do.
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.820]   This is my account.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:15.300]   And I just am a huge fan.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.660]   Finding the books, that's the hard part.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.340]   But there are so many great books.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.660]   Here's one about LBJ indomitable Will, LBJ in the presidency.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.980]   I've listened to every Audible book there is about LBJ.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:29.940]   There's even, I think with Samuel Beshloss, who had the recordings from the Oval Office
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:37.500]   and listening to LBJ, one of them, he's sitting on the can.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.580]   And he would meet, he would bring in Sam Irvin and the leaders of the house, Sam Rayburn,
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.740]   and he would be in the john.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.220]   He said, "Come in here, boy."
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.460]   And he would talk to these guys.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.940]   It's unbelievable.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.460]   It brings history to life.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.900]   If you've got a kid, the young adult section is fantastic.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.420]   Of course, Twilight and all of that stuff, the Hunger Games.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.540]   I just listened to the Hunger Games while doing my taxes.
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.380]   Now, that's a young adult, right?
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:01.300]   This is as far as my mental capacities would go.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.060]   But I think it would be great to listen to.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:07.860]   Oh, well, my whole thing about audiobooks is that whenever you have to do something
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:13.820]   that's drudgery-based, like laundry, doing the dishes, doing your taxes, put an audiobook
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:14.820]   on it.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:15.820]   That's a good idea.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:16.820]   That's my complete reward structure.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.740]   I'm not sure I could do it while doing my taxes.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.580]   Well, just like the timing, all the numbers.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580]   But certainly my driving.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.580]   In fact, I drive.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.740]   I'll go actually drive people places so I can listen to my books.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:27.740]   This is the Hunger Games.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.740]   Suzanne Collins, narrative--
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:29.740]   It's fabulous.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.740]   --Carolyn McCormick.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:32.940]   The other side of the bed is cold.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:39.220]   My fingers stretch out, seeking prairie warmth, but finding only the rough canvas cover of
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.220]   the mattress.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.220]   There's not music all the way through it.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.220]   That's just the beginning.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.220]   No, just to be true in the close.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.300]   In fact, all of the Hunger Games books are on here.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.500]   This is just-- there's two of them.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.460]   Three of them.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.380]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.180]   You could do that before the movie comes out.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.060]   That would be a good thing to do.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.620]   Bestseller sci-fi.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.900]   I listened to a lot of history.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:03.420]   As I mentioned, Young Adult self-development, it's all there.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.500]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:11.300]   So you'd recommend this even though it's not really a kid's book.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.300]   It's a young adult.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.300]   No, young-- I love tween fiction.
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.140]   I mean, I love all the vampires.
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.620]   They're actually really well-written.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:21.500]   There's another great one in there called The Highest Tide that's not a dying dystopian
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.740]   vampire-ish, but just fun, science-y, great tween-lit.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.740]   I love tween-lit.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.740]   It's great.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.220]   Your children are four.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.220]   You've got a way to go.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.860]   Yeah, I know.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.380]   But you could give them read that go to the F to sleep.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   I do that all the time.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.380]   I got to play.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.380]   I'll tell CBS.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.580]   I just can play a little bit of this.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:43.620]   I won't get to the-- this is Samuel L. Jackson.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.020]   I think they offer this for free.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:47.940]   No, it's $1.71.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.860]   You could get it as your free book if you really wanted to.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:50.860]   So this is so--
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.580]   Just we'll play a little bit tiny bit of this so we don't get in trouble here with
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.580]   the FCC.
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:57.500]   We're not broadcasting.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:01.460]   All the kids from daycare are in dreamland.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.620]   The froggy has made his last leap.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.220]   Hell no, you can't go to the bathroom.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.820]   You know where you can go?
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:14.220]   Well, we'll just have to imagine where he's going to go.
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.220]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:18.180]   You just for that, you want to join Audible.
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:19.180]   I know.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:21.620]   They were giving this away for free.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.940]   You should have got it when it was free.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.340]   That's all I can say.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:26.580]   So Mike Daisy, nice guy.
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.740]   You don't remember him when he came on the screensavers.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.180]   I really remember him, right?
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:31.180]   From the screensavers.
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.180]   I don't remember.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.180]   Sarah does.
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.180]   Sarah does.
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.180]   So he was a monologist.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.660]   He did a bunch of monologues.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:41.740]   His most recent was the agony and ecstasy of Steve Jobs.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.100]   And these are stage performances.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.100]   They're comedy.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.100]   They're funny.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.100]   You laugh.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.100]   They're poignant.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.100]   They're poignant.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:49.100]   There's a lot going on.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.100]   He claims.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:54.060]   He's going to start saying things like he claims that he got an iPhone with some pictures
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:57.260]   on it, which frankly struck me always as a little bit strange because I can't imagine
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.500]   that sneaking, somehow slipping through.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:03.060]   But he claims and he looked at the pictures of the workers and thought I would like to
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.860]   know more, went to Shenzhen, China.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.940]   That apparently is true.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:10.060]   Met with some people, did some tours, but apparently didn't meet with all the people.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:14.340]   For instance, he claimed he'd talked to people who said they were poisoned in the manufacture
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.340]   of the iPhones.
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.820]   He didn't.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:19.980]   So there was a considerable amount of made up material.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.460]   Not a lot.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:22.780]   Well, considerable.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:24.540]   Not all of it.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.700]   Some of it was true.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:30.860]   Unfortunately, he was the centerpiece for this American life.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.860]   It's not NPR.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:35.940]   It's America, public radio, PRI, public radio, international.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.180]   Probably the best radio show there ever has been or ever will be.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:41.100]   That was 460 some episodes.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.100]   Incredible.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.100]   Ira Glass Brilliant.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.180]   And it is a journalistic enterprise.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:46.900]   Although there's fiction, there's humor in it.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.820]   Yeah, they have David Sedaris on occasionally and he does monologue.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.820]   Serival.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:57.660]   But in this case, they decided to play Mike Daisy's monologue and then do an investigation
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.460]   of the plant.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:05.140]   And then it came out that Mike had made up some of this monologue.
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.540]   Significant portions.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:13.100]   In terms of the specificity of who we talked to, what maladies they were suffering from,
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.380]   what the actual discourse was.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:22.940]   And when you listen to the original episode, Ira Glass does a ton of couching where he says,
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.260]   we fact checked.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.180]   We talked to this many people and they said that they have witnessed things of this tenor
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.340]   in Apple factories at Foxconn.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.540]   There have been incidences like these.
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:41.860]   And it was an unusual amount of CYA from this American life in the episode.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.980]   And when you, I think they were really nervous about it.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.980]   They didn't trust him completely.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.540]   And one of the biggest things it turns out is when they were doing the fact checking,
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:56.020]   he would not give them the name of his translator who was a central part of the story.
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.380]   He said, "Cathy introduced him to a 13 year old girl."
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.620]   Or, "Cathy was with him when this man with the mangled hand."
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:10.900]   And when the hexane cleaner, the people who'd been, had neurological damage from hexane
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:14.220]   cleaners were with him and he wouldn't give them the name.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:16.380]   So who's it fault though?
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.740]   Is it this American life for still running with that story?
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.420]   Or is it Mike Daisy?
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:26.020]   I mean, it seems to me Mike's making up a theatre piece, much of which often, theatre
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.180]   pieces are made up.
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:28.700]   No problem.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:31.860]   In some senses, in terms of the actual issue of journalistic integrity.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.260]   But he's not a journalist.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.260]   He's not a journalist.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:38.420]   Then he goes on this American life, wants the publicity, wants the story.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:40.020]   He cares deeply about the story.
[01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:44.460]   And by the way, there's still nobody saying, "Well, it's not a truth."
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.100]   In substance, the truth is there.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.940]   It's just not what he said happened.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:53.260]   But nobody, I mean, Apple acknowledged an effect by opening up their doors and said,
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.900]   "Yes, audit us."
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:59.220]   The two biggest significant fact problems in the story were he made it seem like there
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:02.180]   are massive underage workers in the factories.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.180]   Not so.
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:04.180]   Right.
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:05.180]   That's the biggest part right there.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.180]   Right.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:14.900]   One that was called out, and all this was the NPR reporter in China just found real inconsistencies
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.300]   and Rob Schmitt's, and he went out and in fact checked it and found the interpreter
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.660]   who said, "No, it didn't go down like that."
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:28.420]   So the second biggest inconsistency is that when people are hurt, they can sue for damages
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.180]   after their hurt and factory accidents.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.700]   Those were, I don't know if you picked that up.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700]   That's a big one.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.700]   The two big differences.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.700]   Yeah, that's a big one.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.260]   They can sue.
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:42.780]   So the problem was he went on this American life and went down to the biggest problem.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.820]   I mean, I don't know if you can point fingers out.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:48.580]   I don't know which one of them is the biggest.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.380]   Mike is absolutely at fault as well as this American.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.380]   He lied.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.700]   Yeah, I don't know who, I mean, if there's more blame on one or the other, both are to
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:56.700]   blame.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:03.180]   However, there wasn't there some good, I mean, results of this, the New York Times did it's
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:10.500]   a big expose, Apple in fact asked the fair labor practices folks to report on this.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:14.260]   They opened their doors to ABC Nightline.
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.540]   It seems like there was some benefit to all of this, yes?
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.100]   Great things happened.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.100]   Was Apple liable?
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:20.580]   Was it misrepresenting Apple?
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.460]   I called, I emailed Apple this weekend and asked them if they had any comment.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:32.020]   Obviously didn't hear back, but I think they, I just, I'm not even sure if there's a victim,
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.100]   that it goes down to the James Fries of the world, the Stephen Glasses.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.380]   It's that when you misrepresent the facts, you make it seem like the facts aren't strong
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380]   enough on their own.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.580]   Good point.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.580]   And they are.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.580]   Good point.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.140]   There's, yes, good point.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.900]   Hey, thanks.
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.340]   I totally agree.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:55.580]   And I think the positive outcome that came from, from this, although it's sad that it
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:27:02.500]   came out at all in the original report, is that Apple became more transparent.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.380]   People had their attention focused on this.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:10.500]   People think maybe, I hope they think more about where these gadgets come from now, given
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.820]   the Nightline report and lots of others, like, like the New York Times reporting it.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:20.500]   So I don't think there was really any benefit into the, the embellishment that went on.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:24.180]   But if we had to pick what something, it would be the, this transparency.
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:29.780]   And you could say the negative is that now this cast doubt on, it might make you think,
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.620]   well, maybe Apple doesn't have a problem.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.580]   Maybe, maybe the Foxconn factories are fine, right?
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.580]   Maybe this is all.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.580]   I mean, that's too far.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.300]   I think by nature, yeah.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.180]   I think nobody's going to think that.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.380]   It's really interesting because Bill Weir, who's one of my new colleagues and the reporter
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:50.500]   who went to Nightline really sort of was struck by, you know, he said he kept looking for
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.420]   what Daisy described.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.220]   And that doesn't, he didn't find it, but that doesn't make anything that he reported and
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:01.380]   the footage that he brought back any less compelling and any less sort of powerful.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.540]   I mean, when you look at that stuff, you really see that the nature of the problems there.
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:10.460]   I mean, of course, the pictures of the nets have been around for years, but anytime you
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.100]   do see them, it's very powerful stuff.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:20.900]   So yeah, I don't think, you know, in the end, I don't think there are no issues there.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:24.780]   Obviously, are very, very big issues and it should be very interesting to see the results
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:29.220]   of the audit, which I think we're actually due last week or we should be seeing them soon.
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:30.220]   Right.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:36.540]   NPR, this American life did an hour long three act episode on the retraction.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:42.780]   And I found that just as, this is all at this point kind of a looking glass into journalism
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:48.100]   and the media because I found it fascinating that they were absolutely crushed.
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.460]   I mean, they were so upset.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.260]   Ira Glass was furious.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.700]   He felt that his reputation had been impugned.
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.900]   And you know, I shouldn't he have done more to vet this stuff?
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:02.100]   I mean, I like to say, they made a big deal about how they fact checked it, but apparently
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.100]   they didn't.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.100]   I mean, he apologized.
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:07.100]   I only listened to the first 45 minutes.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.100]   Yeah, you can only take so much retraction.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:15.340]   Yeah, you can't, but I mean, liberals flogging themselves gets really boring after a while.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:18.860]   It's an interesting thing to consider what Apple must be thinking about.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:24.020]   You know, do we super definite defamation over this or not?
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.540]   Because you know, the truth is the defense to defamation.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.060]   So they would come in and say none of these particular things didn't happen.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:35.260]   But what a can of worms they'd be opening to investigate the truth of all that.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.260]   That's probably another issue entirely.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.260]   Let's not.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.260]   Right.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   Let's just move on.
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   It's probably how they feel about it.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:46.020]   I was going to say, I think we can all agree Friday was a pretty great day for Apple.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.100]   This news came out.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.300]   The iPads went on sale.
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:55.180]   So kind of on a roll, just a little bit of a roll.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:30:01.660]   Meanwhile, if there is an anti apple, an opposite, an apple, it would be Yahoo, a company in
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:04.220]   such deep trouble.
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:06.180]   I don't even know where to begin.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.420]   They're suing Facebook saying we invented social networking.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.420]   And there's some merit.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:12.420]   They have some patents.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:16.140]   Well, the court will decide on that.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:20.380]   They fired pretty much the best people working there.
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:26.220]   This article from a Pando daily, they they fired the what the Yahoo research and development
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:30.980]   team Yahoo research.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.340]   And according to Sarah Lacey, they're all going to Facebook.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:37.140]   Whoops.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.500]   This hasn't been confirmed, but apparently the New York Yahoo research team is all out
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.860]   of work.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:50.980]   And many companies are going, okay, well, if you're smart, if you're good, not hard
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:58.380]   to find a job with Google or Facebook or somebody speaking of which we got to be pretty proud
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:04.260]   of our friend, Kevin Rose, who confirmed to me when I emailed him, I said, congratulations.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:05.900]   He said, yes, pretty great.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.500]   He said more to follow.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.260]   So they closed Oink.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:19.220]   So Kevin, after he left G four, where he was a host of the screensavers after I left focused
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:24.300]   all his intentions on two companies, Dig and revision three turned down a ton of money
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.300]   for Dig.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.700]   Well, you know, there's some question I actually asked him about that.
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.380]   He said, you know, Google looked at us, looked at us, looked at us, but ultimately they didn't
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.660]   pull the trigger.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:36.700]   So I don't know if he turned it down or they didn't get, they didn't offer, but Dig then
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:40.540]   went through some very hard times with their new version.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.860]   Kevin left the company.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.620]   He's no longer CEO there.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:47.300]   He still is, I think a shareholder at both dig and revision three, but devoted all his
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:53.860]   attention to his own investments as an angel and to milk his new company, M I dot L K and
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.300]   milk.
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.340]   The idea behind milk was it was a small team.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.780]   I think it's seven people there, including Daniel Berka, who's the original designer
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:08.460]   for Dig, Chris Hutchins, and they made an app called Oink, which I loved, but five months
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.500]   later, not enough adoption.
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:16.180]   He told us on the stage at the web that 150,000 downloads in the first month, which is pretty
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:18.100]   good, but it just stalled.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:21.220]   And what he had always said is what we're going to do with milk is we're going to iterate.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.540]   We're going to do something never done before.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.540]   We're going to try stuff.
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:26.060]   If it doesn't work, we're going to drop it and move on.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:30.140]   So I wasn't too surprised when he sent an email out to all the Oink people, including
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.780]   myself saying, we're, you know, take your data.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.780]   We're gone.
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:34.780]   And they did.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:35.780]   They gave you the data, which I don't know.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:36.780]   It's an all an XML.
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:37.780]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:45.380]   But the next day, TechCrunch and all things D report milk has just been sold to Google.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:48.540]   TechCrunch said, and I don't know if this is true and Kevin won't confirm it, 15 to 30
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.020]   million, which makes no sense at all.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.980]   A mill or two to each employee.
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:56.820]   And you figure a significant stake to send a rose.
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:01.180]   And I cannot, I mean, I'm thrilled for Kevin, but I can't quite figure out what they're
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.180]   going to do.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:03.420]   Well, it's social.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:08.860]   I mean, it's obviously it's going back to all of the Google talk this week about it's
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:09.940]   all about social.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.220]   It has to be social.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.820]   And if you can't build it, buy it.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.340]   Kevin doesn't say what they're doing.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:20.380]   The story was that they would be working for Google+.
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.380]   Right.
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:23.900]   Makes sense.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:28.260]   I wonder, I still think that maybe there's more to this, like maybe revision three is
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:29.260]   also in play.
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.260]   Okay.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.260]   Okay.
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:32.260]   So rapid, but okay.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.860]   So the, what you're saying is that they want their own network.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:34.860]   There's something else going on.
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:35.860]   So just be interesting.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:42.300]   Why, if they have Yahoo, if they have YouTube studios, why would they need revision three?
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.380]   Same reason they bought next to networks.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:48.460]   They, they, what they need is, so it's interesting because revision three, and this is a little
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:51.700]   inside baseball, but everybody who watches Twitter, of course, knows Kevin well and knows
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.220]   revision three.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.940]   And then revision three went from being what we are, which is a producer of content to an
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.620]   aggregator of YouTube stars.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:01.980]   Their biggest show, no longer dignity that's gone, not even tekzilla anymore.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.460]   It's a, that crazy cooking show.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.260]   Oh, that's the meal time.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.260]   Epic meal time.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.260]   Oh, it is.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.660]   Isn't that their big show?
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.660]   I think it is.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:11.660]   Wow.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:13.260]   And, and fill the Franco.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.620]   They have filled a Franco is another huge YouTube star.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:19.380]   So what they've done is they've gone to big YouTube stars and said, let us just as next
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:25.060]   new web did next to networks did let us help you monetize market.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.900]   You focus on what you do best making these shows.
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:31.860]   And, and so they pivoted and became an aggregator just as next to networks is.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:35.020]   And that is exactly what Google is doing with YouTube.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:38.620]   In fact, we're starting to see the first YouTube channels Felicia Day, who's going to be on
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:44.020]   game on in about an hour, has just announced her channel.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.740]   I may find you have the video.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:50.980]   Oh, the geek and sundry is geek and sundry is his name.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.660]   And I'm really interested in watching all of these.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:35:01.060]   Yeah, they have a hundred million dollars Google has put into brands like Shaq.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.460]   Is Oprah doing something for him?
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.900]   I can't remember.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.900]   And good.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.900]   This is geek and sundry.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.540]   Can we get the cotton hat again?
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.500]   So these are all geek culture shows.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.500]   There's Felicia.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:12.500]   She's.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.500]   I don't know.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.700]   Oh, and the reason I mentioned this is Tom Merritt.
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:21.180]   And Veronica Belmont, two of our hosts are going to be doing their podcast, Sword and
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.820]   Laser.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.820]   There's Will Wheaton.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.540]   He's doing this is an interesting idea for a show.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.940]   They're going to play board games.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:27.940]   I love it.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.900]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.100]   I wanted to do this with poker.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.740]   I wanted to do a twit poker table.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.300]   We never got around to it.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.300]   Great.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.900]   So she's so basically they gave some unknown amount to Felicia.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:44.780]   There's Ben Ha playing a board game and a Viking has cheeseburger and Felicia then gave
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:45.860]   money to these producers.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.380]   And so they're producing a network.
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:51.140]   And I imagine the theory behind this is we'll see what sticks.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:52.140]   Right.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.620]   They're all up in the wall.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:54.620]   Interesting.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.580]   It's to me.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.580]   Interesting.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.580]   That's all I can say.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.580]   I don't know.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:01.580]   There's Veronica and Tom.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.580]   I know those guys.
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:03.580]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:08.220]   So that's their book group podcast, you know, science fiction and fantasy podcast.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.300]   In fact, they built a big set next door, a castle.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.980]   There's a big castle next door.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:13.980]   Have you seen it?
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:14.980]   No, my kids.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:15.980]   I've played it.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.980]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.980]   Jump in it.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.820]   So this is what YouTube or YouTube is going.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:24.620]   I have to say I hate this because I feel like the problem is that because Google is
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:29.380]   such an important part of the internet in terms of its search and they favor YouTube
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:34.180]   so much, it gives anybody on YouTube is huge advantage over somebody like us.
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.180]   That's right.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.020]   And they've completely locked us out of YouTube live.
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.380]   They won't let us do it.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.900]   They constantly pull down our shows from YouTube itself.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:44.940]   It's not a very good platform for us.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:51.340]   So I feel like because Google is going into the content business, the content creation
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:54.620]   business is the conflict stick a stake into my heart and shoot me.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:59.300]   And if they buy revision three, no, we'll hold the phone because you know what?
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.740]   I thought we were going to be talking about the in the show at the beginning of this week.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:06.380]   I thought we were going to be talking about CNN buying Mashable.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.380]   And now is that a true story?
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.380]   Do they do that or not?
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.540]   It's just a rumor to 100.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.540]   Two.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.540]   This is the rumor.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.540]   And who knows if it's true?
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540]   It's true.
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.540]   It's a strong rumor it was.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.540]   Two hundred million dollars.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.540]   It has not been consummated.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:23.620]   And so I was going to come to you and say, dude, if Mashable is getting bought by CNN,
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.100]   then you've got to become now that everybody wants to be a content player again.
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:30.100]   You have to be an acquisition target.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.620]   Well, I haven't had any calls.
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.620]   I know.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.620]   I'm just saying.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.900]   I'm not asking for him.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:39.380]   I don't want him, but I'm just what I'm saying is I worry and it's not about Twitter.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:44.900]   I worry about the independent content creator because now one of the things that I celebrated
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:50.420]   about podcasting was anybody could create a show or a network and compete with NBC and
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.500]   ABC.
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:56.260]   Clearly the major networks with all due respect, Joanna and Becky, but the major networks are
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.500]   struggling.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:02.900]   But now what's going to happen is Google going to become the new NBC?
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.300]   I hate to see that because what we don't want is media conglomerates.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:12.460]   We don't want the concentration of voices we want everybody to be able to participate.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.620]   And because Google runs search, that's a real conflict of interest.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:21.100]   I think what you see is a window of opportunity, not a trend and an overall direction.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.940]   I think you really got in front of this and you know, well, I agree, but it could really
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.500]   be bad.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.500]   And you know what?
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.500]   This is what Tim Wu always said.
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:32.460]   He said, don't get all excited about the free and open internet because as soon as it's
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:36.620]   financially viable, the big companies go, thanks very much, you guys.
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620]   See you later.
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620]   We'll take over from here.
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:42.620]   They did it with a long distance and he said they're going to do it again with the internet.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.500]   So enjoy it while you got it because it's going to be yours for very long.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.980]   And I mean, I think there are more players than just YouTube.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.340]   I mean, that's why I actually really liked revision three being an independent play.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.340]   You've got Twit.
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:55.260]   I know Yahoo gets slagged.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:39:01.300]   I understand why, but the numbers of video that they are streaming, unbelievable.
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.780]   I mean, my shows are averaging a million and a half views for every episode.
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:05.780]   Really?
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:06.780]   Yahoo.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.780]   Every episode.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:08.780]   You've done 50 episodes.
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:09.780]   I'm thrilled to hear that.
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:10.780]   You know, oh, one other thing.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:11.780]   This is total sidebar.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:13.260]   Last week you were talking about Coney.
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.260]   Yeah, in 2012.
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.260]   And you said 78 million views.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.780]   It's got to be a bot.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.780]   I checked the numbers yesterday.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:20.780]   It was only 79 million.
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:23.740]   Oh, it's suddenly stalled, which makes me think you're right.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.900]   I think maybe the bot got turned off.
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.980]   You saw that the guy who made that video had a little problem.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.980]   Oh, he had a mega break down.
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:31.980]   Wow.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:32.980]   Was it a nervous breakdown?
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:33.980]   That's what it sounded like.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:36.580]   Yeah, no, it's his wife says he doesn't have a substance abuse.
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:38.060]   The video TMZ posted it.
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.900]   It looks like something for a fire.
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:43.020]   It was just, oh God.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.420]   It was so bad.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.420]   Minus Raydongchon.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.420]   Raydongchon.
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:48.420]   Excuse me?
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:49.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:55.180]   It's interesting to watch Google get into this business and not.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.420]   I agree with you.
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:02.740]   It is very worrisome for the independent content creators.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:06.500]   But if it comes back to Google, just wanting to sell more ads.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.380]   Well, it always comes back to them.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.380]   Right.
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.860]   And slap them on video that they've invested in.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:19.300]   It's just, I have to hope that they'll continue to use this platform to the benefit of others.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.300]   But I don't know.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:22.300]   I don't have that much hope.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:28.300]   It's kind of the same trend as the whole Google defection this week.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.780]   Well, that's some wondering.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:32.980]   They hire Kevin Rose, but the guy in charge of apps leaves.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.980]   Right.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:39.580]   And he claims it's because Google has gone, James Whittaker, I think his name was.
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:45.380]   And he wrote this long letter basically saying that Google has lost its entrepreneurial and
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.380]   innovative soul.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:47.380]   Right.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:51.460]   I don't listen to disgruntled employee leaving letters anymore.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.100]   I don't know that Goldman Sachs thing.
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.100]   That's my word.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.100]   It was a little different.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.100]   That was like blowing the lid off Goldman Sachs.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.300]   That was pretty remarkable.
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.620]   And the other thing about that is it kind of confirmed what we all thought anyway.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:10.220]   A bunch of skuving take our money kind of.
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:13.460]   It just scares me after this time period of the recession and everybody's lost so much
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:14.460]   money.
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:19.500]   And I don't know that just it shook the underpinnings of what faith I had in the financial system.
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.340]   You had faith in the financial system.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:25.900]   I just thought there was some it goes back to the journalism issue on this American life.
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.220]   I thought there were some things that people.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.220]   You're like me.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.220]   You believe.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.660]   I want to see the sad show.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.160]   We're not cynics.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.160]   Are you a cynic Joanna?
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.160]   No, I don't think so.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160]   Denise.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.160]   Oh, you are?
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.160]   Well, you're in New York or you have to be.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.820]   I actually see these these departures and all the fluidity and a down economy is a good thing.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.820]   How so?
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:50.620]   You know, well, you know, after the whole dot-com bus, that's when you saw things like Facebook
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:55.580]   and Twitter come along and people leave and whether they're leaving because their companies
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:42:00.100]   are getting cutthroat and not having the same vision that they, you know, had hoped
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.980]   for or they're leaving because they're being downsized.
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.940]   You know, it sort of kicks people out into the world and makes them be creative and follow
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.620]   their dreams and that's a good thing.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.420]   I'm with you on that.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:11.420]   I agree.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:12.660]   A couple more stories.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:19.820]   The end of Venera and Cyclopedia Britannica will no longer print a paper edition web only.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.220]   I have in the other room the world book.
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:25.420]   I thought when the kids were little, I thought, oh, this was so great for me.
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.300]   We'll have an encyclopedia in the house.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.660]   What is, what is I moron?
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:32.060]   Then then Wikipedia came out a day later.
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:36.460]   Yeah, but this is, this is to take the Debbie downer trend that was progressing from the
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:38.220]   last 10 minutes of conversation.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:41.340]   I'm just going to say this, this story is not bad.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.100]   This is a company that gets it.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.020]   Well, one percent of their sales were in paper form.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:48.140]   It's kind of hard not to get it.
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:49.140]   Right.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:52.300]   They've been making this conversation a little too late.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.660]   But you know, I, here's my thing.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:57.060]   I'm such a tech evangelist, but I don't, I'm not comfortable handing my kids a screen
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:59.420]   because there's too many other options.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:03.340]   So I will be finding an encyclopedia in some form for them.
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:04.340]   Maybe it's older.
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.900]   Maybe it's not 100% up to date, but at least when they have that book in their hand, that's
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:08.900]   all they're doing.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:11.620]   And there's no jelly defense or angry birds on it, you know?
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.180]   Well, you can buy them.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:18.260]   You can still buy these, these things that they call the books.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.780]   These things called books on shelves.
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:25.580]   So pretend I spoke to the CEO and he was saying, well, we still have some stock left.
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.300]   We expect it to go quickly.
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:28.300]   You know what I love?
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.580]   In fact, I would buy it.
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:30.580]   I would buy it.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:31.980]   That's going to be historical.
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:34.740]   And I have the Oxford English Dictionary 20 volumes.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.780]   I love that.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:38.580]   But it's, it's kind of feels anachronistic.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:39.580]   It does.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.460]   Because everything, it's like, I have a ham radio corner.
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.460]   What the hell is that all about?
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:44.460]   I can do it with Skype.
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:45.860]   I can call around the world for free.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:49.380]   It is, you're getting your ham and through the web from somebody on these ghosts.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.620]   I know, it's crazy.
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.820]   I'm using Skype because my antenna doesn't work.
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:53.820]   You know what?
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.820]   You're a faux ham.
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:55.820]   I'm a faux ham.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:56.820]   You're a spam.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.100]   You're some sort of pork product.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:03.580]   Becky Worley, ABC Good Morning America's and my dear, dear, dear.
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:04.580]   I love doing this show with you.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.580]   I love having you.
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:06.580]   I just love having you.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.580]   I just love having you.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.060]   Apologies for all we've offended.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:14.460]   And of course, Denise Howell, who I just adore, who was just such a rock solid contributor
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:17.540]   to the Twit Network every week with that great This Week in Law.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:19.700]   Her blog is Bag and baggage.com.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.340]   What day is this week in Law Friday?
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.300]   It is Fridays at 11 Pacific, 1800 UTC.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.300]   Oh, she's got it down.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.300]   Yes.
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.300]   I love that.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.300]   It's so great.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:32.300]   I love having you on the network, Denise.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:33.620]   I love being on the network.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.940]   It's the best part of my week.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:36.940]   Well, thank you.
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:37.940]   I can't thank you enough.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:40.860]   And my new friend Joanna Stern, it's really nice to meet you.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:41.860]   Nice to meet you too.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.660]   And your giant microphone.
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:44.660]   She knows her stuff.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:45.660]   She's a keeper.
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:46.660]   You know what?
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:47.820]   I am so impressed.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:51.860]   You know, really, I hope you'll come back often.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.980]   I would love to come back.
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:54.980]   Good.
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.980]   And the next time you're out here, we've got to get you to the studio.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.980]   I want to leave you.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:59.780]   Yes, because maybe we can do an all-girls show again.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.500]   And I will be more appropriate.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.540]   Actually next week we're going to do another woman's show with Veronica.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.540]   Who else?
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:07.540]   Veronica keeps ditching me.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.540]   Huh?
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:09.540]   Yeah, she's...
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:10.540]   Dr. Keke and Sarah Lane.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:11.540]   She's really nice.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.540]   So it'll be our Twit hosts.
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:16.580]   And the next time Joanna, you want guys, you want girls, whatever you want.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:18.420]   We'll stock the panel.
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:19.780]   You want booze.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:20.780]   It doesn't matter.
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:21.780]   Anything you want.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:22.780]   Hey, you're so accommodating.
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:23.780]   I'm going to mention...
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:24.780]   The story ends.
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:25.780]   No, I'm not done.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:28.020]   I know, because Tom Merritt is here.
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:31.540]   And he likes to come in every once in a while and just tell us what kind of week it's shaping
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:32.540]   up to be.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:33.540]   What does the week ahead look like, Tom?
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:34.540]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:38.060]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be covered on Tech News today in the week ahead.
[01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:43.060]   On Thursday, March 19, the London Web Summit kicks off in London, England.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:46.180]   Tuesday, March 20, the Nikon D4D800 are now...
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:47.180]   Mmm.
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:51.840]   Wednesday, March 21, the anniversary of the first Twitter post being sent, also Microsoft
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.460]   launching the Windows Phone Tango in China.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:59.540]   And Thursday, March 22, the studio Rovio will launch the game Angry Birds Space.
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.540]   Oh, I've been waiting for...
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:01.540]   Oh, I've been waiting for...
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:02.540]   On Tech News today.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.540]   Actually...
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.540]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:10.820]   Today, every week, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2,300 UTC.
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.020]   I can do that, too, on Twitter.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:15.620]   I did want to leave you with something...
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.620]   Morgan Webb.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.620]   Morgan Webb.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:19.620]   We love Morgan with two bees.
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:24.260]   Of course, the host of X-Play on G4 and before that on Tech TV.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.420]   And she had...
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:26.900]   She did...
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:30.460]   For a while, she did a podcast, which I wish she kept doing.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:33.820]   But the reason she did the podcast was I had met her and her husband at the airport.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.580]   And said, "Morgan, you've got to do a podcast."
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:40.500]   Her husband, Rob Reed, started Rhapsody, started Listen.com.
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:43.060]   And this week gave an amazing TED Talk.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.700]   Actually, he gave it a couple of weeks ago, but it was posted this week.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.180]   And I just thought we'd end with this.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:56.180]   For those of you who are worried about the music industry and the grave impact that piracy
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:59.860]   is having, this is Rob Reed's TED Talk.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:03.860]   And he gave me permission to put this on Twitter.
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.860]   A little copyright math for you.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:21.580]   The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the actor agreement
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:24.700]   in Europe has been very emotional.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:28.300]   And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:29.820]   to the debate.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:34.740]   I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting-edge field of copyright
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.540]   math whenever we approach this subject.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:42.820]   For instance, just recently, the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:47.580]   $58 billion a year to copyright theft.
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:52.340]   Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:57.380]   And he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:04.460]   Ocean Boulevard to the Westin and then to Mars.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:07.580]   If we use pennies.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.500]   Now this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful insight.
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:14.300]   But it's also a morally important one.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.900]   Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:21.220]   talking about, but this is actual economic losses.
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:27.060]   This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing, along with all of our fruit
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:36.660]   crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum, whatever sorghum is, losing sorghum.
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:42.260]   But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.260]   math.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:48.260]   Now, music revenues are down by about $8 billion a year since Napster first came on the scene.
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.620]   So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:55.180]   But total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay per viewer, up.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:58.260]   And TV satellite and cable revenues are way up.
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:02.140]   Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up.
[01:49:02.140 --> 01:49:12.140]   So this small missing chunk here is puzzling.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:16.540]   Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.980]   growth that piracy has prevented.
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:24.780]   But copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:27.660]   historic norms, one that didn't exist in the 90s.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:32.500]   What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.500]   [laughter]
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:42.100]   $50 billion a year, which is enough at 30 seconds a ringtone that could stretch from here to
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:45.140]   Neanderthal times.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:47.100]   [laughter]
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:52.140]   It's true.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:56.500]   I have Excel.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:02.780]   The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft, which
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.500]   is quite a lot when you consider that back in '98, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:12.820]   that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:16.140]   Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:19.900]   And so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft have therefore
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:22.500]   left us with negative employment in our content industries.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:27.460]   This is down to the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.940]   with every day and some people think that string theory is tough.
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:31.940]   [laughter]
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.940]   Now, this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians toolkit.
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:40.980]   It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:43.660]   song or movie gets pirated.
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.300]   Hollywood and Congress derive this number mathematically back when they last sat down
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:52.380]   to improve copyright damages and made this long.
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:55.820]   Some people think this number is a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:59.820]   are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:00.820]   every year.
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:06.500]   Now, when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.100]   and it was a big Christmas hit.
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.980]   Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:12.980]   in his pocket.
[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:20.700]   [laughter]
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:27.200]   These days an iPod classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say, $8 billion, which is
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.060]   stolen media.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:34.580]   Or about 75,000 jobs.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.660]   [laughter]
[01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:38.580]   [applause]
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:44.820]   Now, you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:47.100]   left to experts.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.420]   So that's it for now.
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:52.780]   I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:57.260]   inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to the American economy.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.260]   Thank you very much.
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:02.580]   We'll actually have Rob on because he's writing a science fiction novel, which will be out
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:08.540]   in July about what happens when the aliens get sued for music piracy.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:10.540]   It doesn't end well for the planet Earth.
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:11.620]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:15.660]   I thought that was well worth showing just because the math is pretty dramatic.
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:16.660]   Awesome.
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:23.460]   And it's the most accurate response to the music industry's claims I've seen.
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:26.540]   So I guess there's not much more to say except thank you Joanna.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:27.540]   Thank you, Becky.
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.540]   Really appreciate it.
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:29.660]   Oh, and one other thing.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:30.660]   One other thing.
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:31.860]   Chicks love Leo.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:32.860]   Thank you very much.
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:33.860]   Well, they do podcasters.
[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:35.500]   That's what it said.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:36.500]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:37.500]   Thank you Denise Howell.
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:42.140]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, right after the Tech Guy show, 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:43.140]   time.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.380]   Please stop by and watch live because there's always a lot of fun before and after.
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:50.140]   And if you can't, well, we make audio and video available at twit.tv.
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:52.940]   If you would subscribe, it would make me very, very happy.
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:53.940]   We'll see you next time.
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:54.940]   Another twit.
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:55.940]   This is so amazing.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:56.940]   Come on.
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:57.940]   Come on to twit.
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:58.940]   All right.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:52:59.940]   Two on the twit, baby.
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:00.940]   Two on the twit.
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:01.940]   All right.
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:02.940]   Hey Veronica made it.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:03.940]   Oh, we didn't tell the story.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:04.940]   Oh, no.
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:09.940]   We didn't tell the story.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:11.740]   She made it.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:12.740]   She made it.
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:13.740]   What happened?
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:14.740]   You got to tell the story.
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:15.740]   Here comes the story.
[01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:18.140]   Oh, I don't need to take your seat.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:20.140]   No, no, no, no.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.140]   Hello.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:23.340]   So you were, you guys, Tom and you went to Wundercon.
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:24.340]   Yes.
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:26.940]   We went to Wundercon to announce that Sordine Laser is a video show.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:27.940]   Yes.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:29.940]   And we played a little bit of the ates from the...
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:30.940]   Oh, nice.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:31.940]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:32.940]   What is it called?
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:33.940]   Dangle and Dongle?
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:34.940]   Geek and Sundry is...
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:35.940]   Geek and Sundry, thank you.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:36.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:37.940]   Wow.
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:38.940]   You just want to go back to the dongle.
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:39.940]   Yes.
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:40.940]   Dangle and Dongle.com.
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:41.940]   Dangle and Dongle.com.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:42.940]   Geek and Sundry.
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:43.940]   Don't go to dangle and Dongle.com.
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:46.940]   I don't know what that is, but it can't be good.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.940]   It can't be good.
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.020]   It maybe just invented that.
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:50.940]   It launches April 6th.
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:54.940]   So Sordine Laser, the first episode goes live on the 13th.
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:55.940]   You're going to be on Fridays.
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:57.240]   Yes, we're going to be on every other Friday.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:58.940]   We're rotating with Will Eatin Show.
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.940]   Couldn't be better.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:00.940]   It's a tabletop gaming show.
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.440]   That tabletop gaming show looks like a lot of fun too.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.440]   It's Google, dangle and Dongle, don't.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.440]   Don't do that.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.440]   Okay.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:10.440]   So it's called, what again?
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.440]   Geek and Sundry.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.440]   Geek and Sundry.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.440]   So you can go to GeekandSundry.com.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.440]   You don't have to go through YouTube.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:19.940]   Yep, the trailer's up and a little bit of info about all the shows.
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:20.940]   Is there?
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:21.940]   They're sick shows.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.440]   So you announced, including of course, The Guild.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.940]   And you announced that you would be a part of this wonderful network.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.440]   This is one of the new YouTube networks.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.440]   Yeah, we're very excited.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.440]   We're going to be on Starmed 2, which is cool.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.440]   Yes.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.440]   They have a scripted show.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.440]   That's going to be really funny.
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440]   And Felicia's going to be on your show tonight.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.440]   She is indeed.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.440]   So what happened?
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.440]   You were flying back from, where's this?
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.440]   LA, San Diego, where was one of her?
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:45.440]   Anaheim.
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:46.440]   We were at John Wayne.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:49.440]   And we got a bit like 430 because our flight was really early.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.280]   So we were trying to get back early enough so I could get home, get fixed up, come in,
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:55.280]   do a twit, do everything.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:57.080]   That takes you hours to get ready.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.520]   Hours, hours and hours.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.720]   And we got on the plane and we were taking off.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:08.080]   The plane was going down the runway real fast and then all of a sudden they slammed
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.680]   on the brakes.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.080]   And the captain started saying, "Everyone remain in your seats.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.080]   Remain in your seats.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.080]   Remain in your seats.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.080]   Remain in your seats."
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.320]   He repeated it like six times really fast and I got that.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.080]   That doesn't sound right.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.440]   And so they stopped the plane.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.440]   They brought it back to the gate and they had the mechanics look at it.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.840]   There was a problem with the electrical system or something.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.720]   So they made everyone get off and then not only did they have it, well it was.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:33.520]   They were taking off a warning light went off and they stopped.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.520]   Exactly.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.320]   Which I appreciate, safety first.
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:40.120]   That's totally fine except for the fact that they canceled the flight and there was no other
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.320]   flights like until 6.30 PM on LAX.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.240]   So there was nothing.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:50.840]   So we actually switched over, got on Southwest and got the next Southwest flight out.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:52.560]   Thank you for making it back in time for the game on.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.040]   I'm sorry you missed the show today but you'll be on next week.
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:56.840]   We're going to do another all female panel.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.680]   Oh really?
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:00.080]   It's going to be you Sarah and Kiki.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.080]   Nice.
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.080]   That's right.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.080]   I thought you were just trying to avoid me.
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:04.560]   I know, I'm sorry.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.560]   Do you know Joanna?
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:09.200]   We've never been on a show together or anything before and I tweeted out her as soon as I
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.440]   found out I wasn't going to be honest.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.600]   I promise I'm not avoiding you because we were doing last week the day.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.240]   Oh, it was the IT, right?
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.240]   It was the IT, right?
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.240]   And you.
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.240]   And I think you had to go something else too.
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.720]   Maybe you couldn't get back home or something.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.240]   Yeah, it was a tough day.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.240]   So I apologize.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.240]   I'm glad I get this.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.240]   No worries.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:29.600]   I'm glad I hear virtually in the post show.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.600]   It was fun.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:32.600]   Joanna was great.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:33.600]   We're going to have her back.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:34.600]   So of course we have you back.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.400]   Talk about the biped stuff.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.400]   Yes, we did.
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:38.400]   Do you like it?
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:39.400]   I got to get in that studio the next time.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400]   You should, Joanna.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400]   It's great.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.400]   It's really fun.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:43.400]   Yeah, I have an iPad too.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.400]   I don't know if I'm going to upgrade.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.840]   I think maybe it's just not the time for me.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:51.440]   I'm sure maybe when Ryan gets one, I'll get my hands on it enough and I forgot to mention
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.200]   GDGT is making some changes.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.200]   Gadget, yeah.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.960]   They did make the change.
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:57.960]   He calls it.
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:58.960]   He just has a call.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:56:59.960]   Yeah, it's gadget.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.600]   Years ago we were going back and forth.
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:03.240]   I know it was all very confusing.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.440]   So gadget is going to go kind of back to its roots and be more of a review site.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.080]   Well, they've got, yeah, they have a new redesign up.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.880]   I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk about it.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:12.880]   Looks like it's up.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:13.880]   But it is up.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:15.880]   I got an email like an email.
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:17.520]   You guys can hear the news here first.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.520]   Awesome.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:21.920]   Yeah, I've been a little, I've been a little behind today and keeping up with everything.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.520]   So it was, original idea of gadget was it was, it was more social.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:30.040]   You'd say, I like this, I have this, I want this.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:31.880]   And certainly I did that and I signed up and so forth.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.480]   But now you're going to, he's going to go back to, of course Ryan Block was at an gadget.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.560]   I think, was he a founding editor?
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.720]   I think he was.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.520]   He was part of the original staff, but he was originally, he was managing editor first
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.280]   and then he came editor after Peter.
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.800]   And so, you know, they're going to go back to what they do so well.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:53.200]   Niele Patel and Ryan Block and do lots of...
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.200]   Oh, Nielei's average.
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.260]   (mumbles)
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:58.040]   - Peter and Ryan.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.020]   You understand why I'm so confused.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.440]   It's so incestuous.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.200]   These guys are all like moving around Joshua and Neelye
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.200]   are at the verge, Johanna's at ABC.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.340]   - Everyone is doing their own thing.
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:09.340]   It's funny.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:10.180]   - This is what you're saying Denise.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:12.680]   This shows a healthy economy.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:13.520]   - Exactly.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.340]   - Movement people move around.
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:18.720]   - Actually, I love this design, this GDGT thing.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:19.720]   - I do too.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:22.320]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.520]   I love this.
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:25.600]   This is such a, so it's sort of like taking
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.600]   like rotten tomatoes idea.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.120]   - They're giving it a score.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:30.500]   - Why are you better than your estimated
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:33.040]   - They're disseminating scores from around the net.
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.640]   So they're using all the major tech review sites.
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:39.160]   - So this is not just gadget's score on the LITRO.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.920]   This is everybody.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.640]   - Yeah, but then they also put their own,
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.160]   you know, they have their own review, their own spin.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:46.240]   - And they still have the habit, want it habit.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.120]   - And the user reviews, which I think are
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.560]   is one of the best parts too.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:50.400]   - Look at this.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.240]   - Very useful.
[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:53.360]   - They write their own reviews also.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.920]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.800]   My brain is really tired and I forget exactly
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:58.640]   what they're doing.
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:59.960]   But.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:00.800]   - Look at this.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:02.680]   - They're gonna have, I mean, they regularly write
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:05.040]   reviews for the site on their own profiles too.
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.240]   So they'll continue to do that.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.080]   - Right.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:11.000]   Well, as a gadget reviewer and someone who's very involved
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.720]   at the gadget review world, this looks awesome.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.880]   - Yeah, I know the team has been, they've been working
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.800]   really, really hard on it and getting it out.
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.880]   - Would you say it's a pit, it's kind of a pivot?
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:22.320]   - I don't know if I would call it a pivot, maybe.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.160]   - Refocus.
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:24.680]   - You have to ask Ryan, his opinions.
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.920]   - Yeah, you shouldn't speak for him, you don't work
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:29.240]   with these guys, you know. - Yeah, no I don't.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.800]   - It looks great.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:33.240]   I will use it a lot. - Yeah, it's really pretty.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.160]   - Thank you, he'll be happy to hear you guys say that.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.600]   - Well, it's a competitive space, in fact,
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:38.960]   in gadget starting to look of all of them the most,
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.560]   the oldest now because the verge looks so hot.
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:42.920]   This looks great.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:45.080]   And those are the big three, right?
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:49.840]   - Well, everyone's occupying slightly different spaces.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:52.640]   They're doing similar, yet somewhat different things also.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.840]   - I like this quantification of it, I like, I think the score.
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.960]   I think people are looking for a quick and easy way
[01:59:57.960 --> 01:59:59.880]   to understand if this is something I should look at or not.
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.320]   - I hope Ryan's not watching, he's probably like,
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.240]   why are you not explaining this better?
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.400]   - You're doing fine, and I put you on the spot,
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:06.600]   and you're right. - I can't explain it.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:08.520]   I see totally what's going on here.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:10.640]   So the critic review on the left is,
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.480]   they're either they're taking the score
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:18.000]   of what the site took, or they're putting it
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.840]   on a different scale.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.280]   So I worked at Laptop Magazine for a very long time,
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.880]   and I'm very familiar with their scale,
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:26.000]   and they do one out of five, or yeah, one out of five.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.520]   And they've upped it to a 10 point scale on GDG.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.760]   - To normalize it, yeah.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.680]   - Right, to normalize it, and now they're sort of assigning
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.680]   scores to sites that don't have scores either.
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:41.080]   So something like Slash Gear, they don't have scores,
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.960]   but they sort of read their review and they felt like,
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.400]   oh, well, this was a nine on the MacBook Air.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.600]   And then they're taking all of that,
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:49.600]   and they're giving it an average on the critic review.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:50.600]   - You're hired.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:52.640]   - Yeah, and the slant on this.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:53.760]   - They're familiar with this space.
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.480]   And then so on the user review,
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.400]   they've got all the users on the right hand side,
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.720]   and now they're, you know, the users are actually
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:01.720]   rating on the 10 point scale and doing it over there.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.560]   - Right.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.120]   - I love the new redesign in this part,
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.200]   especially like these.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.240]   - This is really pretty.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.120]   - Well, and the slant on it is it's quick.
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.320]   It's one page take, so you know.
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.640]   - All the important info is up here above the fold.
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.960]   - What they're saying is these 20 page reviews
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.600]   that you see on some other sites, that's fine.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:18.480]   If you want that kind of detail, so forth, fine.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.640]   But if you want a quick take on, should I, you know,
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.520]   good or not, this is it.
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.080]   And here's a synopsis of what others have written.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.800]   I think this is a very effective.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.360]   - I want to call Ryan and make sure we get some ABS.
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.040]   - Well Ryan actually just texted me and said
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:32.200]   he'd love to jump on Skype and tell you about it.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.040]   - Go ahead.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:33.880]   - Oh yeah, I mean, I'm good.
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:35.400]   - He's like, you guys should be good.
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:36.480]   - And he's like, wait.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.120]   - If you want to get ready, 'cause I don't want to--
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.760]   - No, we can't do anything until you guys are done anyway.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.640]   So, I'll just hang out here.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:43.040]   I'll just stay here for the next hour.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:43.880]   - Let me grab Ryan.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.360]   - And I can't do anything till I eat dinner.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:49.280]   - Go ahead and eat dinner, Joe, and thank you.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:50.200]   You don't know what dinner is?
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.200]   You live in the New York City, the world of dinner.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.120]   - I don't know what my dinner is.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.960]   - It's the dinner at your door.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:57.120]   There's 800 chicken places.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.680]   Have some chicken.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:01:59.680]   - Just order some chicken.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.520]   - What made you go with chicken?
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:01.360]   - Chicken, 21, why?
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.640]   - Chicken, actually chicken was the big thing for a while,
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:05.200]   but now it's all halal food and stuff.
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:07.720]   But chicken for a while was like rotisserie chicken
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:08.920]   was on every corner.
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.120]   That was maybe when I was--
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.560]   - The best falafel ever is in New York.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.840]   - My moods. - My moods.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:14.960]   - My moods. - Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.800]   - That place is amazing. - That place is so good.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.200]   - I hear that the halal cart at 53rd and 2nd
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:21.040]   is the one to go.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040]   - Hey, do you hear us, Ryan?
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:22.880]   - Really?
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:23.720]   - You just make that up?
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:24.560]   - I'm just actually on you, too.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:25.600]   - You were just in New York.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:28.000]   - I was in New York for three minutes, yeah.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:28.880]   - Say that again.
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:30.400]   - Hey, Ryan. - Hi.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.600]   - So what did Veronica get wrong?
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.360]   - I came in a little bit late.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.320]   I just heard, first I saw my Twitter stream blow up.
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.240]   - I did my best.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:42.240]   - We would just say, I had forgotten to mention it
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.080]   on Twitter since Veronica was sitting here.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.680]   I wanted to mention the new design and gadget
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:48.360]   and what a great job you've done.
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.920]   And Joanna Stern actually did a really credible job
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.760]   of explaining what you were up to.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.800]   - She did your justice.
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:55.280]   I could not, I'm sorry.
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.320]   - Yeah, it sounded, oh, it seemed like,
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:59.120]   now you have the prototypes from the site
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:02:59.960]   actually behind me.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:01.400]   - How long have you been working?
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:02.880]   And the question I asked Veronica,
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.440]   which she didn't answer, she deferred to you,
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:05.800]   is this a pivot?
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.400]   - I don't know, I guess it kind of is.
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:10.480]   - That was my answer. - I was my answer.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.280]   - I mean, yeah, we've done reviews on the site
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:15.000]   for a very long time, but not like this.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.240]   - So it's more refocusing from the social site
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.920]   to more of a review site?
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:20.760]   - Right, exactly.
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.680]   So we found a couple things.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.360]   One, the user reviews on the site
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.480]   was always one of the best parts of the site.
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.880]   It was one of the things that people got the most out of
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:32.320]   and enjoyed the most when they contributed to them.
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:35.440]   And the way that we do user reviews is very unique
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:40.480]   with like a kind of criteria based rating system.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:42.840]   And what the users kept telling us
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:45.960]   was that we should be doing more in the review space.
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.080]   And I'm not really satisfied with what publications
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:51.360]   out there are doing.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.120]   I think that there's a lot of really amazing reviewers
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.480]   out there and I think they've definitely carried the torch
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:02.000]   into the new media space since we've kind of gone
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000]   into the post magazine like review form online.
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.040]   But we haven't done the next step, which is to build
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.480]   an experience that's much more useful on top
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:19.920]   of the great review work that other people are already doing.
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.400]   - Well, that's what I was saying is this,
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:26.480]   I think people, while there's a place for the 20 page review,
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:28.480]   what people really want is a single page they can go to
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:31.880]   and get a, is it worth buying one of the pros and cons
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:35.120]   and you do this really well by both aggregating
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:38.000]   other people's reviews, your conclusions.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:38.920]   And I think you're right.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.200]   I think highlighting the user reviews is a really great idea.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.440]   Plus the design is fantastic.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.280]   - The pictures look great too.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.400]   - Yeah, the design is beautiful.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:46.240]   - Yeah.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.520]   I mean, part of it's just, you know,
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.240]   this is kind of like where my personal tastes have gone
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.320]   over the years as well.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:55.360]   You know, I mean, Joanna knows as well as anyone,
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:05:00.120]   you know, how intense it can be to be in the new space.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:02.720]   And, you know, what it's like to have to deal
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:04.880]   with a fire hose of information.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:06.800]   I personally can't deal with that anymore, right?
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:11.800]   Now I need somebody to break it down as efficiently
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:13.480]   and effectively as possible.
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:17.120]   So I, you know, I don't have to waste 10 hours to find out
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:22.120]   if a product is actually worth taking a better look at.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.920]   - How big is your team now, Ryan?
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:25.960]   - We're about 15 people.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:26.960]   - Wow.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:27.800]   Wow, that's great.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:30.800]   - People are making fun of his iPod headset,
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.120]   but he's just at the office.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:33.680]   He doesn't have his good gear.
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:34.520]   - Yes.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:35.360]   - In the conference room.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.200]   He wasn't expecting to be on the show.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:37.040]   - No.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.960]   - It's an emergency call.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:39.880]   - Please snobs.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:40.720]   They're probably,
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:42.880]   I'll send you a good headphone review here.
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:45.680]   - Well, actually I'm just looking at the headset reviews
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:46.880]   right now on gadget.
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:48.960]   And it looks like there's some very good choices out there
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:52.960]   like the Logitech BH320 or the ROCAT Cave,
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:54.160]   which I had never heard of.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.400]   - Yeah, there's so many, so many good headsets.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.520]   - I'm gonna have to read these reviews
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.360]   'cause we sent them out.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.360]   - I'm just saying bad headsets.
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:00.200]   - That's right.
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:01.040]   That's accurate.
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:03.440]   So sorted by score, this little one from one of the.
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:06.000]   - Do you know I only use bad headsets?
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:06.880]   Why is that joining?
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:07.720]   So then you can.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.320]   - Because I lose them everywhere.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:10.200]   - Oh.
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.040]   - Yeah.
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:14.040]   - I will buy like a $150 headset and I will lose them.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:14.880]   - Yeah.
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.800]   - I always lose the little like the plastic earbuds
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:18.720]   and then I forget where I put all the replacements.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.040]   So then I just have like a really sharp thing in my ear.
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.120]   - Yeah, I do that too.
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:22.960]   - Nobody likes that.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:23.800]   - I do that all the time.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.280]   And I'm like, oh, this is definitely gonna damage
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.120]   my hearing.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.200]   (laughing)
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:28.960]   I really need to listen to this Spotify,
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:30.320]   why I'm writing or something like that.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.320]   - Yeah.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.160]   - Yeah.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:33.080]   - Well, Ryan, thank you.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:33.920]   Thank you.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:35.560]   I'm glad we could give you a little plug.
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:37.280]   - I'm really excited about the redesign
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:39.440]   and congratulations on the launch.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.280]   - Thank you.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.120]   - Yeah, we'll talk about getting my ABC news reviews up here.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:42.960]   Don't worry.
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:43.800]   - Sure. Yeah.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:45.360]   No, we love to have your reviews.
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:47.600]   I mean, we haven't even actually officially launched it yet.
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:48.920]   We just kind of put up the site
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:50.200]   and we've been fixing bugs all day.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.200]   So we're actually gonna get some help.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.480]   - I got the email today.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.800]   Like you can sort of tease it, right?
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:57.840]   - Oh, it's because you're a member of the site
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:59.040]   and you follow.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.360]   And so basically the people who follow me on the site,
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:03.240]   like my friends on the site see when I.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.320]   - Oh, that's what it was.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.160]   That's what it was.
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.000]   - Yeah.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000]   - Ryan just posted a story.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:07.840]   That's what it was.
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:08.680]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.520]   - Right, 'cause I get whatever you write
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:10.920]   or whatever comes through on that,
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.400]   but I thought it was like a public newsletter.
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:14.240]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:15.080]   - Books.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.520]   Do we like break your embargo?
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:17.360]   - No, no, it's fine.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:19.240]   We put a public anybody can go see it.
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:20.320]   It's out there.
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.360]   It's just, you know, we're still fixing bugs
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:24.720]   and kind of getting it ready for, you know,
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:27.120]   getting it ready for people to really kind of dig into.
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:28.440]   - Yeah, here's the email.
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.720]   - I didn't start getting a conversation by the way.
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:30.560]   I didn't do that.
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.320]   - No, I asked him 'cause I turned on the fire hose.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:33.160]   - I mentioned it.
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:34.360]   Now, as long as we got you, Ryan,
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:37.720]   what do you think, you also broke this story for me anyway,
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:39.840]   getting it in my email that Apple's gonna make an announcement
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:40.680]   on its cash balance.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:43.080]   What do you think the announcement's gonna be tomorrow?
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.840]   - Obviously this redesign site.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.160]   - The redesign gadget, of course.
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:51.000]   Yeah, they're gonna go on a buying spree starting with us.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.120]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:52.960]   - Nah, that would be--
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.800]   - One--
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:54.640]   - They've been known to do with us.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:55.640]   - You would dollars.
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:56.760]   - No.
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:57.600]   - I don't know.
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:00.680]   I mean, I think dividend seems certainly feasible.
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:02.920]   I don't think that they're going to announce
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:06.240]   that they're going to start a wireless carrier or anything.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:08.200]   I mean, that's like what everybody's speculating,
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:09.520]   but they were gonna do that.
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:12.440]   They wouldn't do it under the guise of,
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:16.640]   here's how we're going to address our financial considerations
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.720]   with our cash in the bank.
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:18.560]   - This is--
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.400]   - They would do an announcement.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.920]   They do a proper public press announcement.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:22.560]   - What's weird, this is kind of unprecedented.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.760]   This is, you know, they just had their public meeting,
[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:27.560]   their shareholder meeting, their quarterly call
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.880]   wasn't so long ago.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:31.080]   This is just kind of out of nowhere,
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:35.280]   all of a sudden, of course, their stock price hit $600 on Friday.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.960]   They had a great launch week last week,
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:40.080]   as Joanna pointed out, with the iPad.
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.200]   But it's just, it's not, this is something new.
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.440]   I think this is a Tim Cookie kind of thing to do.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.920]   It's not certainly something Steve would have done
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:49.320]   at a 9 a.m. conference call
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:51.680]   on what we're going to do with our $100 billion.
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:55.480]   I'm curious, I think you're right, dividend,
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:58.720]   which by the way, something Steve always refused to do.
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:00.520]   Apple never offered a dividend.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.240]   And so this would be a significant story.
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:03.520]   In fact, they even said, "This is Cheryl."
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.040]   It was meeting, "No, don't get your hopes up.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:06.440]   We're looking at it, but we don't."
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:08.120]   You know, it was really one of those.
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:09.880]   Yeah, we're looking at it.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:13.080]   - Tim Cook thinks of finances and, you know,
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:14.360]   Apple's position in the stock market
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.400]   very differently than Steve did.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:18.800]   I mean, Tim Cook, I think, looks at it
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.280]   like a finance guy and like an operations guy.
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.000]   And Steve looked at it as a burden
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.560]   and, you know, something that just, you know,
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:27.600]   is a reality of being a big company
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.600]   that they had to deal with.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:33.200]   At least that's kind of how I've always perceived it.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:34.520]   - I think he's going to get on the phone
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:35.520]   and the first thing you say is,
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.400]   "Meener, neener, neener, Mike Daisy's a wiener."
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.360]   And just, and that will be it.
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:42.360]   So, thank you, Ryan.
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.200]   - One can only help.
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:44.040]   - So, so it's nice.
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:45.520]   There's the most I've seen Ryan in two days.
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.920]   - Aww.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:48.400]   If you two want to have a little time together,
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:49.600]   just put them in the double box
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:51.200]   and we'll all leave you alone.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:52.760]   - Great. - Well, hi.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:55.160]   (laughing)
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.560]   - Oh, that's adorable.
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.960]   - Start singing somewhere out there
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:59.400]   like from my people go swiss.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.000]   - I feel like I'm on a third wheel.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.840]   - Oh, damn.
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:04.840]   (laughing)
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.680]   - All right, this is cheesy.
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.680]   Cut it out, I mean.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:08.520]   (laughing)
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:09.720]   All right, good, get ready for my show.
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:10.760]   - Go get ready for Game on.
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:12.480]   Veronica Belmont, we'll be back in a moment
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.080]   with Brian Breschwood as soon as we clear the set.
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.000]   Thank you, Joanna's been dying for something to eat.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:17.840]   Go have something to eat.
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:18.920]   - Yeah, I do.
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:19.760]   - Bye, Joanna.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:20.600]   - Thank you.
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:21.440]   - Thank you guys.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:22.280]   - Thank you so much, Joanna.
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:23.120]   Thank you, Denise.
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:24.040]   Always a pleasure.
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:25.880]   - Thank you, so great to see you again.
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:26.720]   - Can't say it enough.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:27.560]   I just adore you.
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:28.480]   Thank you for coming.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:30.140]   - All right, take care, have a great day.
