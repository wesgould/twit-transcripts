[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.360]   This is Twitch, this weekend tech, episode 56 for June 4th, 2006.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.960]   Bork, Bork, Bork.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:47.760]   This is episode 56 of this weekend tech joining us.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.560]   Good mix of people. I think we're gonna have a good time tonight. Of course,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.680]   John C. Devorak is always this year. Devorak.org/blog.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.560]   First words out of his mouth, the last words out of his mouth.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.640]   The first and last word in blocking. Also from Long Beach Island, New Jersey.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440]   So all anyone person that can be? It's John S.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.240]   I live.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.280]   Patrick Norton, my good friend, my good buddy. Are you on vacation?
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.400]   A little bit of tweak of vacation before work in New York on Monday and Tuesday.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640]   Oh, what are you gonna do in New York? They got a premiere for the digital life show and then
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.920]   doing some meetings at the mothership for Ziff Davis. Ziff Davis.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.000]   They're not in one dark anymore, are they? No, they left that place. Not too long after I
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840]   moved out to California. What a nightmare building that was. Their old one-purpose.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.800]   I'm a charming building.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.560]   Awful. Also here, somebody who's never been on tour before from Great Radio. One of the
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.760]   pioneer podcasters, Michael Belhagen, it's great to have you.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.640]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.840]   Thanks for joining us. Michael does Disney's podcast too and has made a business out of
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   podcasting, which is kind of neat. We try. What's the name of your company?
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.720]   Willnick Productions. Willnick. Are you Will or Nick?
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.560]   My sons. I have William and Nicholas.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.680]   That's cute. Also Doug K, who doesn't have a microphone, so he's just gonna have to shout
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.600]   from IT conversations. Another pioneer celebrating your third anniversary.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.920]   That's right. We came up here at just Petaluma just to celebrate it.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   I.G. Conversations.com.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.160]   Learning from the VORAC.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.760]   Three years. Now, podcasting is not even two years old, so...
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.320]   That's correct.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.360]   That's saying quite a bit.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   We try and claim that we are the oldest still running podcast. Now, that ignores the fact that
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.000]   people like you were doing audio way before podcasting. But who would take pride of place older than you?
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.440]   That came out hard. Who at podcast is older than... I mean, was there something that isn't
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.960]   running anymore that is actually older? Well, Chris Leiden did the first podcast, I think,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.360]   which was an MP3 attached to an RSS feed. That makes it a podcast.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.240]   Right. But that show's gone. So we get to know that show.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   Chris Leiden. Good name.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.160]   I don't know.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720]   He was the autonomous Chris Leiden. Well, he was fired from a, I guess, whatever,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.760]   from a public radio station back east. And he did his own shows.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   That's right. It's a interview. Great interview.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.240]   That's right.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.200]   And then so that became the first podcast.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   We should get him on. Whatever happened to him.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.160]   He's great. Oh, I saw.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.600]   About two months ago back in Boston, he's doing a show called Open Source.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.560]   It's on public radio and podcast as well. Very good show.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.880]   Good.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.440]   Open Source is not a good name for a radio show.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.000]   No, we thought about that one.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.040]   Confuses everything.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   Yeah. And also here from CNET and Buzz Out Loud. We're always glad to have Molly Wood join us.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.240]   Hey, Molly.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.400]   Hello. Buzz.cNET.com.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.360]   Is everyone doing that?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.480]   Buzz.cNET.com.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.160]   I'm watching, I'm watching, I went to the CNET Reviews page and you have the world's
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.480]   most massive laptop in front of you. What the hell is that? That is huge.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.120]   It's a new, it's kind of a concept laptop from Dell, the XPSM 2010.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.280]   Looks like the Andre the Giant of laptops.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.640]   It's so strange.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.280]   Believable. And it weighs almost 20 pounds.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.600]   Like it actually, I mean, it was hard for me to carry.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.040]   Great. We're going back to the days of the compact and the sewing machine.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.240]   What's the point?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.640]   More of a lifestyle machine than a true note.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.840]   Essentially, it's a desktop with a 20 inch monitor. You can sort of strap onto it and
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.760]   take to the beach for the weekend or something.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.160]   Yeah. If that's a laptop, I want to see the lab.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.760]   You know, it's interesting though, it has a detachable kind of Bluetooth keyboard
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   and a bunch of like a remote control that actually lets you control the cursor from across the room.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.920]   I can see it actually working pretty well as a computer plus television plus stereo in like a dorm room.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.600]   Oh, that's maybe that's the market.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.320]   Except it's $3,500. So that's clearly not the market.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.920]   So is it for sale or is it pure?
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.400]   Or am I there?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.480]   Is it pure concept or is it actually for sale?
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.280]   I think it is for sale. I assume it's only concept in the sense that they're going to see if anyone would actually buy it.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.240]   Wow. Well,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.480]   $3,500. I don't think they're going to be making one or two.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.880]   Disturbing hell off in products like that sell in ridiculous amounts.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.960]   Probably. It's just doesn't. Maybe it was the way you were demonstrating it, Molly,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.880]   but it just didn't look it looked on gainly.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.080]   It is incredibly ungainly. It's like a suitcase. I mean, when I walked around with it, I felt like I was selling encyclopedias.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.800]   It's a loser. It's not going to shut that cop.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.080]   Yeah, it's a don.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.560]   And there goes the Dell advertising campaign. We're helping to launch next week.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.080]   Actually, they won't get back to us, so I don't care.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.600]   Hey, you know, I've done the other hand, Dell's got some nice little guys that are lightweight.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.080]   Pretty cool.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.880]   So too late, John. Don't try to save it. No, but we never let it.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.480]   You know, people who tried these big clunkers, I mean, even some micro systems made one of them.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.560]   They suck. It's a bad idea. I don't even understand the motivation to do it, frankly.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.800]   I think two big or two small sales. You would do this and say, oh, yeah.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.680]   So you would arrive at the clients with this massive laptop and you'd unfold it.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.480]   I mean, do you have any idea how many vendor meetings I've been to where the vendors are traveling
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.400]   around with a full-sized desktop machine in a moment? Still today, even.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.200]   Wow. All right.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.400]   I think you guys are so much easier to bring one of those lightweight projectors.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.880]   Those are cool too. So if you don't have a dark room or, you know,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.040]   to dark enough room and empty wall to point it at, John.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.600]   So we took a week off for Memorial Day weekend, which means we really have two weeks worth of news
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.440]   we can do. I don't know if we care about going back to the good old days. Why don't we start with
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   the actually the most recent story? It's one that Patrick brought up and you're gonna have to
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   fill me in because I don't know much about it. You were talking about a meeting with the ISPs.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   What was the story? I don't remember.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.600]   Molly was a mom.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.160]   Molly.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.720]   This was CNET actually broke the story. CNET and the USA today, a week ago,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.040]   the attorney general, the guy that runs the FBI, sat down with a bunch of ISPs, including, I believe,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:54.320]   you know, basically reps from everybody from Microsoft and Comcast.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.480]   Hey, well, Verizon.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.680]   And said we wanted you to do us a favor. We wanted you to hold all the records for everybody.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   Everybody wants to hold all of the records for everybody's downloading and search habits for two
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.040]   years. Yeah.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.960]   And then on Friday, you know, the day before yesterday Friday, they were supposed to sit down and sort
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.680]   of start hammering out the details about what they wanted retained. And the undertone was it was
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   the reports were really interesting to read because the undertone was that they wanted the
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.240]   the ISPs to voluntarily do this or they would hammer through legislation to make it locks. They
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.720]   want this they want this information. Sappenable. Is that a word, John? Sappenable.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.760]   It's like it rolls off the tongue. I like it.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.600]   It feels so
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   Sappenalicious.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.960]   Sappenalicious.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.600]   The
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.680]   You're going to the Sappenal colony for that.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.880]   And in Canada, they won't let you register that as a domain name if it upsets anyone.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.840]   But the
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.800]   Sappenable?
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   No, that there's a whole
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.200]   furah about anyhow. It's a political thing. Somebody managed to use their political poll to get a
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.960]   site, the DNS information, register information for a website that was critical of their candidates.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.200]   The
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.520]   So, I've been a Gonzales. Our esteemed attorney general seems to be really kind of backward on
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   privacy rights, I have to say.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.880]   Well, if he's not looking at it, it was from what the
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.760]   and you know, jump in anytime Molly. But apparently from what from what some of the people
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.680]   responding who were at the meeting said is like Gonzales starts the meeting and immediately
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   throws up a bunch of pictures of a child porn
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.360]   Yeah, I agree on the screen.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.280]   About child porn. They want to see who's going to vote for Bush.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.080]   I understand that John, but it's like the next thing they do is they're talking about how it's
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.320]   all about, you know, tracking potential terrorists or being able to pursue terrorists.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.280]   And then at the tail end of the meeting, it's like, well, we'd also, you know, we'd definitely
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.000]   be using this for intellectual property cases. And really that's who's pushing it.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.640]   And then you know, it says that Hollywood.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.640]   Yeah, and the general consensus is it would be like whatever they wanted to use it for to
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.600]   gather evidence for federal, you know, and how those low-
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.280]   It's pretty disturbing. It's pretty.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.840]   You go ahead. They pull up, you know, the most sensational pictures they can,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.200]   terrorists, child pornographers. And that's what they always do when they want to reduce
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.160]   human rights or civil rights. They say, and they've been absolutely hammering on this terrorism
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.520]   argument that, you know, we have to use this to catch terrorism. We have to use this to
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.520]   catch child pornographers. And the feeling in Washington, from what I've heard from various
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.840]   sort of internet lobbyists, is that they've got a lot of tools at their disposal that they're
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.360]   currently not using. There are a lot of child porn laws that aren't currently being enforced.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.680]   And they, you know, they know that they don't have the Congressional mandate to require ISPs
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.040]   and telcos to keep this data. But I can't imagine how unnerving it would be as one of
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.520]   these companies to be in the position of saying like, okay, obviously we don't want to do this,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.120]   but what are going to, what's going to be the retaliation, what's going to be the result,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.040]   if we don't? It was 16. My yourself had a pretty good comment actually in response. They sort of
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.560]   said, we really respect what you're saying. And we're not going to do that. Good. So at this point,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.760]   it's just sort of like, well, who's going to do it first? But didn't, wasn't it about 15 shows
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.040]   ago that we had Dane Jasper, the CEO of Sonic.net, the small ISP up here, who said that they've
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.160]   been trying to get, you know, carnivore and these other boxes in ISPs for ages. What's new about
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.920]   this? Is this new? I mean, retaining information, how is that different from them looking at everything?
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.040]   Don't you think it's very different? Because they're putting the burden of storing, like,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.400]   let's say, if you're talking about two years of the search and IP requests from, from,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.320]   for every user, you're talking about a pretty insane, you know, archival issue, right?
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.280]   It's different from the story of the ISPs. But from a privacy point of view, if the ISP stores
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.400]   that are the FBI stores, it doesn't really much matter. Well, it wasn't just data retention. I mean,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.200]   it would be, it would be literally search terms. It would be emails, not necessarily. They say the
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.480]   content of emails, but who those emails were sent to and when and how often possibly instant
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.400]   messaging correspondence like ISPs turning over your, your buddy lists, essentially. I mean, it is
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.640]   an extreme amount of data way beyond kind of what they already can look at. I might be. And they
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.400]   were saying they would have to, they would have to file a subpoena to get this information. But
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.720]   they just wanted the ISPs to sit on. The idea of having this sitting around in an ISP, I think,
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.160]   creeps me out more. Or they would just, uh, institute a wiretapping program and get it without a subpoena.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.520]   I mean, that's the unnerving part, right? Like, yeah, but why, I mean, in this case, they'd
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.640]   actually have to break into the ISP to do the, the wiretapping. Or they could get the ISP to
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.400]   pollinate T&T and funnel it directly to them. That's well, but most of the ISPs have been
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.120]   pretty amenable to that in the past. You know, oh, they can get the
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.200]   data. They say the search engines. It's not going to be a problem to get the data. What I think is
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.680]   being overlooked in this argument, which I actually mentioned in the market watch column some weeks
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.400]   ago, is that the ability to use this kind of information with some data mining tools to figure
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.560]   out mergers and acquisitions before they happen. So you can make it killing in the stock market is,
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.520]   is I think the real goal of this, trying to find people who are going to vote against you.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.880]   You think Albero Gonzalez is looking for market tips? No, this is how Google made all its money.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:17.280]   Now that's a conspiracy theory. I'm like, oh, that's a 90 degree turn from where we were headed. I think
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.720]   at least they're just want to make some money. Hmm. A. G.s just want to have fun.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.680]   Well, I guess it's sort of you regard like clearly want to do something that is most likely
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.560]   untoward and don't feel it. You can also, this is a great way to identify your political enemies. I
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.600]   mean, you know, that's always this right move to Venezuela. Well, you know, when I maybe I'm just
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:44.160]   getting paranoid, but I have to say I just feel the grip tightening every day further and further
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.280]   from this administration. And I and I have to say the more we talk about it, the more I feel like
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:56.720]   we're going to get a knock on the door. We're going to get on it or hello? Hello? Run Leo, run.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.240]   Get out. Save yourself. It's just scary. Here's another story that's related, I guess, in a way,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.320]   you know, Pirate Bay, the Pirate Bay in Sweden, which is kind of the historically the most
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:14.000]   rude of all the bit torrent tracker sites. They whenever they get a cease and desist or a DMCA
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.560]   request, they just posted online and and mock it were rated Swedish police. And I just for some
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.960]   reason see these guys from the Muppet show going for the very near Harvey the given givis,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.760]   your server. They came in, they shut the place down. Some say all all the Swedes out there,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.400]   send your email to me. I heard exactly mail on this one. We have a lot of Swedish listeners.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.520]   And I know that this is inappropriate, but it's just I can't I can't help it. I just see the Muppets
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.160]   in any event, which is, you know, I'm sure that the Swedish police are just as mean and nasty as
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.040]   police anywhere. But, you know, I just they seem to be very helpful. Leo, and just trying to do
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.680]   good things. I wouldn't want to live in a world without police. And they basically, they went
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.360]   in, they yanked all the servers and inadvertently yanked the servers running some other web pages
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.720]   in the process. Well, and then the irony is that Pirate Bay is back up, back up offshore.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.480]   Didn't take too long. They said they would be up within days and they were. And they
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.000]   continue to claim that they're doing nothing illegal under Swedish law. Doesn't take much to
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.400]   move a server. Well, the interesting thing is that under Swedish law, even if they are
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.520]   found to be violating copyright, I mean, it sounds like the Swedish police served seized about 200
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   servers, only two or three of which were actually running the Pirate Bay site. And even if they
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.320]   are found to be violating copyright under Swedish law, that's punishable by a fine.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.680]   So there's sort of a big question about what, you know, what prompted this massive sort of
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.280]   SWAT team style raid? Well, there's a lot of contention that the US government put, you know,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.680]   Hollywood and the recording industry put pressure on the US government. The US government makes a
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.720]   call to the Swedish government. The Swedish government calls the Swedish police and goes,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:59.920]   for a day. And the bar, but ain't it? All right. That's how it happened. Leo at leoville.com.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.040]   Thank you. So I guess they're looking at their site. Now I like the picture of the ship shooting
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:12.160]   big cannonballs at the Hollywood. Oh, these guys, these guys really have always won my vote for just
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:19.200]   ball ziness, you know, they have an entire anti piracy bureau. One million registered users.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.000]   Holy mackerel. Well, we mean an anti piracy bureau. What does that mean? Anti I don't know. It's
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.320]   got a bunch of letters in it with those weird symbols above it. I have no idea. Anti pirate
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.240]   Byron. If you're a Swedish anti piracy bureau. If you really want to have fun,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.200]   read, click on the bottom of it there where it says legal threats. Those are so rude.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   Right. Just, you know, the email from DreamWorks, for instance, and then our response. Oh, these
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:50.960]   are for like Microsoft email. We get tons of these. These are all 404ing. So I have a feeling they
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   haven't got all the servers up. But this is the best, frankly, the best part, if you ask me.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.160]   And they'll say things like, you must mistake us for somebody who lives in America or you,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.840]   you must your lawyers must be, you know, taking your money because it's not illegal. But I get
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.000]   for users, for listeners out there, the URL is the pirate Bay dot org. And that's all one word
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.800]   without a www. At least I don't. Maybe there's www to but it's the pirate Bay dot org. If you
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.200]   want to have fun, the graph at the bottom of the legal threats page is always so much fun. And
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.520]   it's like nice graphs for the law firms that don't get the hint above threats rising towards the
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:32.000]   leaded remains. It's zero. Although maybe they can't say that anymore. I don't know. They say we've
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.200]   never cared any pirate files. We just have torrent, you know, torrent meta files, which I'm also
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.120]   like saying, I don't traffic installing goods. I just tell you where to buy them. They ate in a
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.400]   bed. But then you get into the whole international law versus American law versus what's, you know,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.280]   how does copyright get applied? And I mean, they are these guys really are promoting piracy.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.720]   They make no bones. Oh, yeah. Look at this stuff. They got you know, I hate to say it,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.200]   but I've actually never been on this site until now. We got a lot of stuff. Thank you, R.I.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:06.240]   Corey Sherman has helped us find new sources. Well, it's considered to be like the premier,
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   you know, it's the one and it's the one that never went down. And when Loki torrent went down
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.520]   with the MPAA threats, all of the trackers in the US went down. The pirate bay stayed open.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.520]   And frankly, I always thought, you know, these guys are the champions of
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.560]   whatever free free piracy everywhere. Well, it's interesting that they're also almost like a
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.200]   sort of, I mean, they're the forefront of a political movement too. There's a pirate party.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.400]   That's what I like saying. Saying essentially we need to reform intellectual property law.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:43.360]   And it is quite I mean, there is still that outstanding question of can we in the US export
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.440]   our intellectual property demands, you know, our sort of particularly draconian set of laws,
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.520]   at least right now. You know, I want to say something in defense of these guys looking at,
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.440]   I'm looking at some of the offerings or some of the links that they have to the various
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.280]   bit torrents. And in the case of, of course, I'm being a ridiculous nerd. I go to audio books.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.480]   But the number two is learn French and the number tell by number 10 or 11 is learn Spanish,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.080]   learn Italian, learn German, learn this or this is a benefit to society.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.960]   Educational. Good. So John, we're going to take everything you've written and later on,
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.640]   we're going to take everything out of your house and we're going to give it to all the needy people
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.840]   in the UK because it's a benefit to society. All right. And of course, if you go to movies,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.120]   you see that the first movie is X-Men the Last Stand, the second one's the DaVinci Coe,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.320]   the third one's Mission Impossible 3. I challenge anybody to try to download these.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.000]   They'll never come over. Well, even if you get it, John, you're not going to go come over.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.880]   Are you in every single? How would you know, Patrick?
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.840]   I have friends in law enforcement that assure me that they work.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.240]   So the cop says, you know, Patrick, the way I see it. It works.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.320]   Bit torrent works. And the wonder why he gets a bad rap. I mean, this is law enforcement.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.760]   This is a good one. He does. He has a friend he doesn't.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.240]   Hey, Patrick, I was in Indianapolis over the weekend and the chief police said to say hi.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.680]   Thanks, man.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:17.600]   This really is a bit torrent's biggest problem because the technology is obviously lumped in
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.520]   with the use of the technology and it can't really make progress as long as it's going on.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.960]   I love that the Motion Picture Association on the one hand is shutting these trackers down.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.760]   On the other hand, is giving Bram, calling money and basically co-opting bit torrent for their
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.640]   own purposes. But how lies they recognize the value of it?
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.120]   We would all like to see bit torrent built into our clients.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.800]   How's that going to happen as long as this kind of stuff is going on?
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.840]   There were actually a number of companies that have already, like iam.com has bit torrent
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.640]   downloads built into their video client and a number of other, there's a couple of video
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.120]   companies that are using it for distribution. And it's also being developed to actually,
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.800]   for a really interesting thing, on some of the cell phone companies are playing around with
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.400]   using a version of it to distribute their downloads.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.600]   But Michael, go ahead. When you like to have iTunes support up here, some sort of peer to peer,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   I mean, what's your bandwidth building?
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.360]   Well, I've got the same deal you do through AOL.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.440]   You don't have to worry.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.520]   But for some of the other stuff we do it, it's a problem. We hide the files in different places.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.080]   And some of the clients actually have it built in, but obviously the main player iTunes,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.880]   it should be in there.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   How about you, Doug? I know you actually were starting to face a real bandwidth crisis. It was
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.920]   a lot of tea conversation.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.440]   Yeah, I mean, we're doing okay right now. But I mean, ultimately, I, it is...
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.560]   You do like a hundred podcasts a week, though. I mean, you're kind of crazy.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.760]   Yeah. But we have a limelight who helped us out.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.640]   Limelight's still helping out.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.760]   We have a partner, yeah. But as we're expanding, we're going to be up against the same problem.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.440]   It would be so much better if you had bit torrent built into a major client like iTunes.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.480]   Yeah. But the biggest problem is that, of course, Apple's got such close relationships with the
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.520]   actual property people. I don't think they could ever do it.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.080]   No.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.520]   And because that just would be...
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.560]   Sorry, kill him.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.440]   Is it... Am I making this up or are we supposed to be getting a bit torrent in Firefox?
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.040]   Patrick, do you know?
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.760]   I've heard that.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.240]   I've heard it, but I haven't seen...
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.320]   Oh, yeah. I haven't seen sort of official client.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.280]   I've heard it.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.760]   All right. No. Maybe that just lines that.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.640]   And my dreams, I woke up saying, "Oh, I just feel like it's going to be..."
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.600]   I'm telling you, this pirate thing is fascinated by it.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.720]   John's enjoying the pirate thing.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.080]   They got some clips on here.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.880]   We can use them.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.440]   Remember the old sound effects we used to use Leo on the old radio show?
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.480]   I still have them.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.760]   I haven't gotten rid of them.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.000]   If you want, I'll send you the disc and you can, once again, make merry.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I'm going to try to minimize that.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.800]   Although there's the time in the Kaaba Belgian Congo still.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.840]   I haven't. I can drop it in any time.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.080]   In fact, I think I did on some of the very earliest twists.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.280]   I think I might have thrown that in.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.480]   Opera, getting back to the browser discussion.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.640]   Opera does have BitTorrent.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.240]   Yeah. Oh, interesting.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.000]   And who uses Opera?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.600]   The Swedish police.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.760]   It all comes back.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.720]   Firefox get angry because we don't mention opera because everything Firefox does.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.760]   They claim it is better.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.560]   Opera does better.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.360]   Firefox is open source and Opera is not.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.440]   Yeah. The other thing, Opera, there's a problem.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.720]   We can't really figure out how many people actually use Opera because it goes stealth.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.480]   It says that it's not Opera.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.920]   It says it's Microsoft Internet Explorer with most users.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.520]   Well, and for people who complain that we don't talk about Opera,
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.560]   we had the president of Opera on Twitch.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.440]   So whatever is it?
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.480]   They're talking about it now.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.920]   You're a mccoconin or whatever it is.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.760]   [laughter]
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.760]   I got it when they were giving away for free.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.880]   That was it, other than that.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.000]   It is free now.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.400]   Oh, is it?
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.120]   It's back to free.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.080]   It's back to free.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.920]   And still good.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.600]   And if you use a phone, it's probably still the best browser for a small device.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.240]   Actually, a lot of CSS experts say it's really the best browser of the three.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.720]   They invented the acid test, which makes it a little unfair,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   but they and Safari are the only two browsers to my knowledge is still that pass it.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.760]   Is that another one?
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.360]   You're like a counter-referencing acid test.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.440]   You're like a cocorion.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.880]   Cacorian, whatever his name is.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.320]   Hot tuna, right?
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.160]   Oh, no.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.280]   Then you guys forgot the Olive MP3 development.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.800]   What's happening with all of MP3?
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   Speak. I mean, they're much like the Pirate Bay.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:18.560]   They've been squeaking through on a loophole in Russian law, offering what they claim to be
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.480]   legal downloads of major music for penises.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.080]   What site is this, Leo?
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.840]   All of MP3.com, John.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.720]   But don't go there.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.280]   Your ISP will know and will continue to know for the next two years.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.520]   That's all you need to say.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.240]   I'm doing it.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.000]   I'm only going to go to these things as a journalist to research and to see exactly what the
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.880]   heck's going on here. I have to inform the public.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.720]   Look, they've got the new Dixie chicks in the street.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.760]   It's actually a pretty good defense.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.800]   Don't kid yourself.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.160]   All of MP3.com.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.840]   The thing that bugs me about them, instead of just saying, "Hey, look, we're stealing fine,"
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.600]   they actually look like a commercial site.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.040]   It's an unbelievably built-out product.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.640]   I mean, it's so professional looking.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.400]   They call it all tunes, not iTunes.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.360]   It's all tunes.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.680]   Yeah, and it looks just like iTunes.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.600]   If you download that desktop, that's unbelievable.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.480]   This is unbelievable.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.000]   This is a very professionally run organization.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.160]   They're blasting kids in college for downloading stuff while this thing is running.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.280]   They can't get these guys.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.160]   They can't get them.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.120]   They can't breath.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.560]   Can I tell you guys about the story?
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.000]   There was a story related to this.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.960]   No, but what's here?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.600]   All right.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.800]   People have been trying to shut down all of MP3 for a while,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.480]   but they are exploiting a really peculiar loophole that basically says that this organization,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.600]   which may be owned by them, is collecting royalties.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.040]   They have the legal right to sell the music this way.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:45.120]   The New York Times is reporting this week that American negotiators are demanding that
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:51.920]   allofmp3.com be shut down as a condition of Russia joining the WTO, the World Trade Organization.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.600]   Yeah, the US Trade Organization has declared it essentially a pirate haven.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.520]   There had been an open question.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:05.200]   If you just Google all of MP3 legal, you'll find all of these conflicting arguments
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.800]   up with people saying, well, it must be legal.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.160]   They say they're paying royalties and we haven't heard anything about it.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.560]   And so I think that at least the trade arm of the US government right now is trying to put
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.600]   the message out there loud and clear that they consider it to be completely illegal.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.120]   If you ask the RIA about it, the RIA says we don't talk about all of MP3.com.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.200]   They do all the international stuff is fed into another, I want to say the IFPA
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.720]   as the international organization.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.040]   And they basically claim it's they basically say, look, all of MP3 maybe paying
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.640]   money into some account somewhere, but none of it has ever been received by an artist.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:46.160]   Well, here's a note that says, I can confirm the legality of allofmp3.com.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.640]   You can legally buy MP3 songs from this site if it does not break the law, the national
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.080]   legislation of the country in which you will be during that moment.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.320]   Sorry for my English.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.760]   You're faithfully the assistant to the lawyer of the Russian society on multimedia and to digital
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.800]   networks.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.600]   Rome.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.120]   And Bruce, listen to squirrel.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.920]   What's in school?
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.520]   I'll say he's a big guy.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.160]   He'll let coach now.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:10.960]   What's going on?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.280]   You know, for a hair, hair, hair, hair.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.240]   Hey, what's amazing.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.880]   I'm going to try to get everybody before the show is over.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.800]   But this is for this is on some site.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.160]   I did what you suggested, Molly.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.880]   And this is on some site that talks about the legality essentially.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.520]   Oh, there's there's a fact available on all of MP3.com.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.000]   Right.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.840]   And essentially the position is it's legal in Russia and it's legal.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.160]   If it's legal in the country, you're in.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.880]   Right.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   So essentially the I think, you know, what most people would argue is it's legal.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.440]   It is currently due to this bizarre copyright loophole legal in Russia.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.920]   But is it legal for you in the US to buy this music?
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.320]   Actually, probably most certainly no.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.160]   It's legal.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   Russian copyright legislation allows phonograms.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.440]   Hold on a second.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.080]   To be perfectly over cable.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.200]   If you go to the IFPI, which is the international version of the RIAA.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.800]   They don't write the international.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.000]   No, actually it's now they've they've it used to be buried.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.920]   Like you had to go through one of their annual reports and go to the Eastern European Russian
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.640]   section like go through 27 pages to find it.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:22.080]   The top story now on the IFPI website is at all of MP3.com setting the record straight.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.960]   First paragraph all of MP3.com is not a legal service either in Russia or anywhere else.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.640]   They say so interesting.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:36.000]   The IFPI is saying that all of MP3 the international organization that the RIAA and all of the world,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.800]   you know, so where does the nine senses song?
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.200]   It's the news as of June 2nd in fact.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.280]   This is like those attorneys that were suing everybody and they'd set up the charity to benefit it.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.520]   And yeah, you know the charity money never went anywhere.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.800]   So the same claims to have a license from ROMs a Russian organization that claims to be collecting
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   collecting society yet ROMs has no rights from their record companies whatsoever to license
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.840]   these pieces of music.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.000]   ROMs and all of MP3.com are well aware that record companies have not granted authorization
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.800]   for this service.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.760]   Well, if there's a common thread to the last two stories it is that you can try to assert
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.560]   US copyright laws worldwide but there will always be places where people can do this.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.720]   And because the internet is fundamentally global, how are you going to shut this stuff down?
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   Well, you have the same problem with a Kyoto treaty.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.280]   There's a lot of signatories but it's questionable as to whether you know all of the signatories are
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   even political.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.560]   Copyright violation going to become our great diplomatic message of the 21st century.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:36.400]   I mean that is what is so sort of ridiculous that we're putting so much effort into kind
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.240]   of politically pressuring these companies over you know what is certainly wholesale copyright
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.040]   violation but is it the most serious issue?
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.800]   So it's the way it ends.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.720]   It's Harvey Weinberg's burden.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.680]   I mean what's the...
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Yes.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.640]   Weinstein.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   Do you must protect Hollywood?
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Do you want to do that voice tune now?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   No.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   No, no, no, no.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.280]   So, um, you know, most of these sites, both of these sites actually have kind of numbers
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:08.560]   of downloads and the like and it's, you know, I don't want to be kind of marginalize the
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.520]   whole thing but the numbers are rather trivial in the scheme of things compared to the millions
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.800]   and millions of albums of Britney Spears sells.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   I mean sold.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.400]   How's now that we have like blown the, you know, promoted?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   They've written me out of it.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.600]   Although I've, let me just say this as a disclaimer.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.880]   I will anyone listening to this broadcast do not go to these sites.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   It's really not.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   We're against piracy.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   Go to these sites.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.480]   You want to give us the URL again, Leo?
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.040]   All of mp3.com but it's a, we are against piracy.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.360]   We are for law enforcement agencies and we love Swedish people.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.960]   But I think people should at least be aware that these exist.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   Right.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   The pirate bait, Donald.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   Have you ever seen that?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   You know what your kids are doing.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   It's your credit card.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   No, you know why.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.120]   I was wondering about those charges from the Russian mafia.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.360]   It's all about mp3.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.720]   Well, maybe we're supporting terrorism by buying stuff from all of mp3.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   Do you ever think of that?
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   Oh, probably.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.280]   I'm really almost certain that we are.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.760]   I know that when I buy cigarettes without a tax stamp I'm supporting terrorism.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   You smoke?
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.760]   No.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.320]   But I like to, I like to support terrorism.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.560]   So I, you know, I always buy cigarettes whenever I can without tax stamps.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   Yeah, you get that.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.000]   Yeah, at some point along the line.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Yes.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.680]   You know, at this point I don't care anymore.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.160]   Come and get me copper.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.560]   I'm like, I'm like Jimmy Cagney in public enemy.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.320]   Oh yeah, exactly the same.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.960]   Michael, go ahead and slowly creeping out the door.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.680]   You got to do your skinny press?
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   No.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   I know.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   I was going to say there was no copper.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   The copper.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.680]   Come and get me copper.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   I knew the world.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.320]   Now, see, I was under the impression that most of these sites were dark.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.760]   I didn't, yeah, if you're kind of dumb now that I didn't know about these sites.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.760]   Well, I think that's what the RIA would like you to think.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.800]   I think that's what the MPAA would like them.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   I believe them.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.160]   Well, that's why all of MP3 is so scary to them because really you would not ever, I
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.000]   mean there's no, you know, sex ads lined up along either side.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   No, it's pro.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   I have naked women.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.080]   I mean, it looks like a legitimate business.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.840]   There's no reason for you as a consumer to end up there and think this must be against
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   the law.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.640]   Well, how'd you get this great iTunes like product?
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.680]   I mean, you know.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.000]   You know, this reminds me of when, well, I've let some, I visited Malaysia.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.400]   You can go, you go to a big mall there and they're selling, openly selling DVDs with
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.260]   all the right packaging and the whole thing and you can actually view them there to make
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.260]   sure they're good ones.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.200]   And they, these are excellent copies and they sell them right at the, you know, right
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.360]   out in the open and you can come back and if anybody would question that you're bringing
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.480]   these bootleg discs back and I assume they are, but I don't really know.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.660]   There's no way to really tell because it's, you know, it seems to be, I can see my
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.600]   people would think, why did you get the dollar?
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.560]   I can say as the prices are cheap.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.120]   I just think because they're like, and then how on earth are those DVD sniffing dogs for
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.200]   FedEx ever know the difference between that DVD and it?
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.680]   There's DVD sniffing dogs.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   We knew that story a couple of weeks ago.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   I think it was two weeks ago.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   I must have gotten dropped.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   They're looking for more.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   They're looking for more.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   They're calling carbonate.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   What are they sniffing for?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   Well, I don't know.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.320]   FedEx hasn't really said they just said that somehow they have these magical DVD sniffing
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.720]   dogs that know the difference between a pirated DVD and a non pirated DVD so they can open
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   up your mail.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.440]   I think that they can, it's possible that some of the, you know, those, those writable
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.100]   DVDs might be odorous.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.600]   That's one of the, they're actually no, they're, they're just identifying packages containing
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   DVDs.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   Yeah, they're sniffing for always carbonate.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.000]   And then customs, it's actually, it's happening in Britain.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.440]   They are using, there was a trial of dogs and packages containing DVDs were open and
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.000]   inspected to see if they were legitimate shipments.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.160]   I just think it's great that one of the featured bands is thievery corporation.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.560]   I thought I saw that at all of them in thrie.com.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.480]   They're a pretty old, that's actually a pretty old punk band.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.680]   They've been around for a long time.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.440]   Well, their time has come now.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.120]   But band is this thievery corporation.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.920]   Like, and they're, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're

[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.800]   like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.640]   like, they should be more worried that Microsoft would build and distribute and
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.800]   evangelize an alternative format. Do you think that's what's going on? I mean,
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.600]   isn't Microsoft also building a competitor to JPG? Yeah, also to PDF, they were for
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.640]   a while talking about a portable document. They backed away a little bit from the,
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.680]   did they? I mean, it's still going to be in there, but I don't think, uh, well,
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.200]   this would encourage them to do this up. You'd think that Microsoft would say,
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.400]   all right, then. Yeah, but there you got to remember something on the flip side for
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.920]   the, for the alternative for JPG until the JPG, until the JPG lawsuit, I can't
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.280]   think of the name of the company that was suing everybody on the for sites to
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.960]   JPG. Until that was thrown out by the Supreme Court, it was actually a pretty
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.280]   smart business move for Microsoft to have a complete alternative to JPG lined up.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.840]   Was this paying or was this something else? No, it was an internal pay. It's a new,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.040]   it's like Windows media image file or something, but it's cropped up again just
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.160]   within the last couple of days. I rescind that statement. They could have just gone
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.080]   to paying, but maybe they thought it wasn't good enough. But yeah, that's, you know,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:50.840]   with the JPG, right, right, where they might want an alternate, uh, it would be an equivalent
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.920]   to JPG. Yeah, that's no longer for compensated gift. Yeah. Yeah. It was a
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.080]   spare or somebody had the, had the gift license. Yeah, that was, I remember that.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.000]   Wait, wait, somebody decides to go after MP3. What will that do? Well,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.640]   Fraunha for owns it. I don't suppose. I mean, I don't think everybody, I mean,
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.440]   it's all, it's all licensed. All the MP3 stuff is licensed.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.360]   So, you guys see this? Go ahead. Oh, it's gonna say, if you guys seen,
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.240]   I actually have to scoot for dinner, but if you guys seen the article, uh,
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.320]   slash that posted a link, remember like the shortwave stations that were always broadcasting
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.360]   numbers that everybody assumed was like, you know, CIA type organizations blasting them out?
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:30.440]   Well, someone's apparently putting number stations on VoIP so that you can call in to a
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.200]   VoIP, to this VoIP number and actually listen to the, yeah, and listen to the numbers as they're
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.080]   being broadcasted. Is this like the, the, the lottery numbers, the, the numbers racket numbers?
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.240]   Is that what you're talking about? What are these numbers? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.720]   for years, for years and years and years, you can turn into certain shortwave channels.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.360]   That's your one, two, ham radio. Yeah, ham radio for enthusiasts referred to them as
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.800]   number stations, right? Nobody really knows, uh, it's like a test signal or something,
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.440]   where it's coming from, but they're basically, they're, they're usually, they're either
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.720]   reading streams of numbers or of words or of letters. And sometimes, mechanically generated
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.800]   voices, sometimes there's in different languages, you know, it could be children, it could be male,
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.080]   it could be female. And a lot of the assumptions is that, that they're, they're communications
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.400]   used to send messages to spies, right? Just keep doing it. Yeah, there must be something in data.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.680]   So somebody's going to release that as a podcast, actually. That's a great C.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.000]   Five, 12.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.760]   There's a couple, there's actually, there's, you can now actually dial in, there's a couple,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.680]   there's two, at least two VoIP numbers you can dial into and hear these numbers.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.760]   And you hear the prerecorded message that's there. Sure. Yeah. And I bet it is for spies or whatever,
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.080]   but it's coming from the planet. How would you get a, you know, no, no, no, no, it's, it's a,
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.760]   it's a known fact that these are the way that people have been communicating with the flying
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.640]   saucers. You've been, you've been hanging out in a pub again.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:57.000]   And how with our bell again, John? John's living in a double wide and
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.800]   prompt. People don't know this. Actually didn't art bell move to the Philippines.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.680]   You've got a Filipino wife and he's in the Philippines now. So there is a, actually a space,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.160]   a lot available in perump. If anybody wants to. Well, this obviously begs for a Wikipedia search.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.640]   What's for dinner tonight? Patrick.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   I think I'm going to, I don't know if I'm going to go for the chowder at one of the places down here,
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:25.400]   or if I'm going to go for a cheesesteak. I've been, I've been jamming on like Eastern European
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:30.920]   food and kosher food and pizza. It's just so much better. Do the cheesesteak. So I don't have to,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:36.040]   Patrick. For you, I will do this. Get the big peppers though. I like the big peppers.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.480]   All right. Here we go. Here we go. Same time art bell announced leaving his long time homestead
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.240]   in Nevada, relocating to the Philippines where he will continue to host coast to coast and
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.280]   weekend editions by an ISDN connection. Isn't it amazing?
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:54.440]   It was a early 2000s. 60 is not returned to his hosting duties. He left on April 29, 2006 and
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.520]   is expected to remain there for at least a year. And apparently he owns a radio station,
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   that only leaves the whorehouses. The fireworks factories and the promos in
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.320]   actually, his, the prom is at a huge, it's become a bedroom community for,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.400]   a bedroom community for Las Vegas. I don't want to send this in the show notes.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:23.240]   And well, there's a couple races I'm in that start in perump.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:28.520]   Yeah, it's pretty valid. The Trump, the Trump, excuse me, the Herbs.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.080]   Do these?
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.480]   I used to race cars. So there's Spring Valley. There's a, there's a racetrack out there.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.040]   But I know, you know, finally, somebody Patrick can talk to,
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.880]   he's talking about, you know, off road races. Yeah. Yeah. Very different.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:44.200]   It's like all of the stupidity of road racing with like added pain and trauma.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.000]   Do you want to go now to dinner or do you want to hang out for a little longer?
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.240]   What's the, what's the, what's your shampoo? I want to hang out, but I'm going to scamper
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.400]   to go to dinner. So, okay. Well, it's,
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.600]   you all for letting me join in.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:00.360]   Oh, it's always a pleasure, Patrick. We will see you on June 16th, right at Yahoo.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:07.400]   We are doing a special edition of this week in tech live from Yahoo for part of podcast Academy.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.440]   Three and Patrick will be part of the panel along with me and Doug K.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.560]   And we're hoping to get was and Alex Lindsey and we're going to have a nice group of people.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.840]   So it will be fun.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.200]   We'll see you then. And I'm still working on trying to get together.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.720]   And we'll see next Friday, if I can, we're going to do the tweet from the Apple store.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.400]   If we can get in there because vlogger con is in San Francisco.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:36.920]   The first convention of video podcasters, people like Andrew Coggin and Amanda of Rocket Boom and
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:42.760]   Callie. I thought Rocket Boom had decided it was IPTV and not a blog anymore.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:48.840]   I don't know what it is. Now it's got imitators. You know, this, this, what is it called?
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.240]   Zeblogger con.org vlogger V-L-O-G-G-E-R vlogger.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:53.800]   Oh vlogger.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.360]   Yeah. So that's going to be a big event. If we can, we're hoping to-
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.240]   Just rolls off the tongue.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.000]   Does vlog. What a terrible vlog.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.800]   Vlog.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.760]   Someone's about a vlog.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.920]   I can see why someone would choose IPTV.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.800]   Yeah. Well, you're a vlogger.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.760]   Don't you do-
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.280]   I guess I sort of am a vlogger.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.800]   I know Patrick's a vlogger.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.960]   It's not too much of a vlog.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.760]   Vlogger con.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.080]   Yeah, you're the deal TV's man.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.120]   I mean, that's probably one of the big, the big ones, the big players.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.200]   No, this is, this is yet another, another conference I have no knowledge of and have
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.120]   admitted invited to be a media sponsor.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.480]   Is this the, is this the term that they've settled on for video podcast?
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.040]   I hope so.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.960]   Vlogger vlogger vlogger vlogger.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.040]   I thought, I thought vlogcast was okay.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.200]   I think vlogcast is a little better.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.040]   Well, vlogger is also somewhat limiting because it implies sort of the blog thing.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.520]   Yeah, it's a bad, and it's just, it sounds like an Eastern European.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:40.920]   I miss a bunch.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.080]   What is a, what is a, what's it kind of spell this, this, this video blog.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.880]   We're getting vlogger vlogger vlogger vlogger with a V.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.800]   V-O-O-G-G-E-R.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.280]   Two Gs.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.200]   Oh, is this the Swedish American haul?
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.320]   So funny.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.080]   Yeah, is, is it, you have to show you've been a few punks?
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.960]   Kind of a river like.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.560]   It all comes back to Sweden.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.680]   It's a vlogger con.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   It's like T-S-L-O-O-G-T-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-R-O-G-T-
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.560]   Chris, a year ago, and he was thinking of bringing all of us together to do a num-dex, but I guess.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.240]   He's still doing it, but he's not bringing you.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:39.800]   Not bringing me?
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.120]   I don't know.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.400]   I was, I was one once.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.240]   Long time ago.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.120]   Many years ago.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.480]   He's doing that. That's whatever the last weekend of the month is.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.320]   So Patrick, we'll let you go have your cheese steak and thank you for joining us.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.440]   dl.tv is the place you'll be back next week with more.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.600]   What do you, what do they do? Do they keep doing shows if you're not around?
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.520]   I wish we pre-taped one.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.200]   Sree-taped one with Robert to roll Tuesday and then our next live one is on Thursday next week.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.360]   We'll have a nice vacation. You deserve it.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.640]   Thank you.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.920]   And if anybody has the word on vlogger con, let me know at dl.tv.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.960]   It's sifdavis.com.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   Sure, they'd love to have you there.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.640]   And why? I'll tell you what, I'll let you know if we do get the Apple store for Friday
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.080]   and you can be a part of it. It's part of their, they have a meat, the vlog.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.520]   I don't have, you know, I'm not going to interrupt, but I will.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:31.880]   I don't have a lot of confidence in a conference where you type vlogger con into Google and doesn't
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:38.120]   show up anywhere. Oh, I got it. If it's all one word, if you took it in, it's all one word,
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:44.680]   then it's the third link. Yeah. After vlogger con dot blogspot.com.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.040]   It was all too expensive.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.200]   Chads rapidly turning into the little old man.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.720]   You know, I see it. It stinks.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.240]   I don't like it.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.880]   No matter what. I'm furious.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.800]   This is too slick for my taste.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.840]   Oh, no, it's too slick. First, you couldn't find it. Now it's too slick.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.400]   All right. This is not your average.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.200]   Check these out.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.640]   It's kids. Thank you, Patrick.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:06.680]   Take care of it.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.000]   Turn it.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.280]   We'll drop you off so you don't have to be subjected to any more of this.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.080]   Oh, yeah. Bye, Patrick.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.680]   Bye, everybody.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.240]   Bye, Patrick.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   Bye.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   Bye.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:22.200]   So, uh, I pity the poor Vonage customers who thought they were getting a deal on the big IPO
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.040]   at $17. The Vonage stock tanks to--
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.560]   I would pity them, except they really thought they were getting a good deal.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.560]   Vonage company that has never been profitable has said it will never be profitable
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.160]   and really has no plan to become profitable.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.560]   So, everybody got excited because they say lawsuits though.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.080]   And now Vonage is saying no.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   Even though our stock is now down below $12, you still have to buy it at $17.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.120]   Probably an SEC rule of some kind.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:46.920]   But I just--
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.880]   No, no, hey, I'm sorry.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.440]   Can you go try to re-explain the story again?
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.080]   So Vonage went public a couple of weeks ago and made an offer.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.160]   I thought at the time seemed very generous.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.680]   We would love for those of, you know, 10,000 customers that we, you know, are really good customers.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.600]   We're going to give you an offer you can buy the stock at the going off price,
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.440]   at the initial offering price of what turned out to be $17.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.720]   And a lot of people took them up on this deal.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.080]   One little problem.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.120]   By the end of the day, the stock had dropped down to $12.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.960]   And these people were stuck buying it at $17.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.920]   Well, Vonage and--
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.480]   Yeah, the nappings.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.240]   Vonage to has called the stock market.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:31.000]   Vonage announced this week that customers who had made that agreement
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.680]   must follow through and buy the shares even though they're worth a heck of a lot more or less.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.320]   I should say.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:37.880]   Of course, they've been--
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.200]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.560]   They would have been happy to buy them, right?
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.360]   But--
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.400]   Well, so in other words, wait a minute.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.120]   Let me get this straight.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.320]   So Vonage made this offer and they didn't collect the money beforehand.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.160]   Well, apparently they had a commitment.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.120]   Now they got to fulfill it.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   But if it had gone up, it wouldn't have been complaining.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.080]   But if it had gone up, it would have been complaining.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:51.640]   Would it have been complaining?
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.360]   Would it have been complaining?
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.200]   I played--
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.160]   I played $17 for a spare forgettable.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.920]   Well, you get to tell back with it.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.600]   It's not surprising to note that they have, as of today, already been sued.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.400]   Oh, I'm not surprised.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   A class action lawsuit under claiming that they violated securities law.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.200]   But first of all, the greed of the people who bought your right molly,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:10.680]   it was dumb.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.880]   If they had done a little research, they would have realized it was a terrible deal anyway.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.280]   But they were rubbing their hands with glee.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:16.920]   They really were.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.520]   And now they're saying, well, wait a minute.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.840]   We're going to lose money in the stock market.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.920]   And you know, it's not the dot com days anymore.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.000]   You can't just go from it with $500 million in debt.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.480]   Interesting thing in the prospectus, though, which apparently--
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.960]   I don't know anything about this, but they say the news reports,
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.280]   the mercury news says it's unusual that there is a clause in the prospectus
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:41.480]   that says that Vonage will indemnify the banks for any losses arising from
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.400]   customers who refuse to pay for their shares.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.320]   So it may be that Vonage-- it may be the banks demanded this upfront,
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.280]   or that Vonage knew this would happen and was preparing an out.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.080]   I'm sure that law requires that.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.680]   I mean, otherwise, it's called a buyback.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   If they agree to buy the stock at the higher price or not to make them buy it.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.560]   Oh, I just guaranteed.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.120]   I mean, Vonage is going to have to take it out of the proceeds
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.960]   and pay back the investment bankers.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.720]   But, you know, it reminds me of whenever that was when Lycos first went public.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.680]   And I saw that prospectus how many years ago was that, Leo?
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.720]   Oh, long time.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.560]   And I just remember reading, the company has no revenues and has no
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.760]   prospect of revenues in the foreseeable future.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.840]   What's going on here?
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.200]   This is not a forward-looking statement, but we're nothing.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:29.400]   I think, you know, actually, they, unfortunately, perhaps these people will have a good
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.600]   case for a lawsuit before.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.680]   Because they basically are going to be able to claim that they were misled by
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.840]   management or misled by the investment bankers.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.440]   And what they're--
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.400]   Those hold up.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   What their lawsuit says now is that apparently there is a securities law that requires
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.680]   that a company recommending the purchase of or sale of its securities to a customer
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.360]   must have a reasonable basis for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:54.840]   Ah, so the crux is--
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.640]   I mean, I think if your own prospectus says you're not going to be profitable.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.280]   The crux is--
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.920]   The crux is did they recommend it or merely offer it?
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.200]   Right.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:02.520]   All right.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.960]   But you see, an underwriting bank is almost by virtue of what it does.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.000]   It's recommending.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.680]   Oh, these things are always written up by lawyers.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.600]   I'm sure they didn't do anything wrong in that regard.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.920]   Yeah, but we'll see.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.440]   We'll see.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.160]   We shall see.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.720]   I love that there's a Reuters story today, too, that the headline is--
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.840]   or from June 2nd.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.720]   "Vantage debut shows IPOs need profitable outlook."
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.160]   Oh, really?
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.000]   Thank you, Captain Obvious.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.680]   No kidding.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.600]   I'll be darned.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.920]   You know, I think the advantage they missed are window.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:37.000]   They could have, I think, been a very successful IPO if they had done this long before.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:37.480]   Yes.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   You made T&T, and Sky, and all this other stuff came around.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.320]   Well, do you think--
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.680]   Do you think three years ago--
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.120]   Will it be successful long term?
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.760]   What do you think--
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.160]   No.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.520]   The future for Vonage, no?
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.720]   Too much competition.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.520]   Too easy to do, huh?
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.560]   Too easy to do.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.840]   Too much free competition.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.680]   Well, and you're up against AT&T, call "Vantage," and about--
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.280]   there's several hundred VoIP providers.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.640]   You know, there's Scott, Sun Rocket.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.880]   I mean, there's just dozens of these guys.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.000]   No, hundreds of these guys.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.960]   Speaking of competitive arenas, Microsoft is--
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.840]   I'm sorry, Patrick left, because I'm sure you would have had something to say about this.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.680]   OneCare is now official, and you can buy it.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.480]   $49 a year, protect up to three computers.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.080]   Antivirus, anti-spyware.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.960]   It's kind of ironic that the company that made the broken operating system that needed
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.000]   oneCare in the first place now charges $50 to protect it.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.840]   I think that's--
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.440]   It really is a hard pill to swallow.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.240]   And everything everybody's been complaining about this.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.160]   It's ridiculous.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.640]   Well, I mean, to defend them, I mean, the problem exists at least--
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.760]   and I think a lot of people will buy the solution at $50 a year,
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   protect three computers if you're buying a new computer.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.360]   I think a lot of people-- it's cheaper than a spany spyware antivirus.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.960]   And is this for Microsoft?
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.000]   Is this for Microsoft?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.360]   Yeah, well, it's online.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:56.680]   It is.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.800]   It's Microsoft Defender.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.280]   It's an antivirus that they've acquired.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.720]   And it's automatically updated.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.680]   And I think because it comes from Microsoft, that's the real issue is that,
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.080]   you know, companies like McAfee say, well, we're going to do it.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.280]   We're going to do that too.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.520]   But why would you buy it from Symantec or McAfee, both of whom we're going to do it,
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.000]   when you could buy it from the company that made the OS?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.320]   Yeah, this is a company that broke it in the first place.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.440]   They're probably in the best position to be able to fix it.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.240]   They're in good shape.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.680]   They're in good shape.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.960]   You know, there's an interesting story that did not completely change the subject,
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   but I thought this was kind of fascinating is that Canon announced that they're going to stop
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.800]   developing these inexpensive digital cameras.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:41.080]   They've decided to just basically go along with their, just essentially take over the high end
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.760]   of the market and not worry about it.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.040]   That's interesting.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.080]   So even the little point and shoots, they're not going to do those.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.040]   They're only doing the, was it digital SLRs or what?
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.920]   Yeah, the digital, well, I mean, they own that market now, the digital SLRs.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.400]   That's very good.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.360]   It's very profitable.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.840]   You can sell a lot of lenses and they're expensive and they have all the things that you want to make
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:03.640]   money. Those little cameras are, and especially Canon never made a good little one anyway.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.200]   It's funny because I just bought a Canon SD 630.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.320]   You just bought a little Canon?
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.760]   That was a mistake.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.280]   Wait, is that what they said really that they're going to, I thought they said they were going to
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.560]   stop making SLRs that were not digital?
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:17.880]   They're big.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.280]   I think those Canon power shots are like some of the most popular.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:20.600]   They're big in that market.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.280]   Well, you're right. I misread this story.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.880]   Yeah, those Canon power shots are.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.920]   That's completely opposite.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.680]   Exactly.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.880]   We're going to get to the film.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.480]   This was my prediction.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.640]   Canon is going to stop making those little cameras.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:35.960]   You might be right.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.680]   I was sitting here all shy like, well, it is John DeFourok.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.160]   I don't know.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.680]   He's talking about it.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.320]   He's talking about it.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.000]   You know, I'm just wondering.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.840]   I think I know how to read.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.040]   Somebody chimed in.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.600]   Well, I'm just thrilled because, you know.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.920]   And by the way, you're supposed to go, you're full of crap, DeVorac.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.880]   We've got to work Molly into the routine.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.440]   Cheese.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.720]   Yeah, I'm going to edit that in.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.600]   I'm new.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.000]   I'm new.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.680]   I'm still being too polite.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.200]   So what is this story now, John?
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.160]   No, this story is that essentially they're
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.840]   stopped making their old-fashioned cameras.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.200]   Yeah, they're going to stop making film.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.080]   Film this day as well.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.040]   I mean, everybody's still--
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.720]   It's not developing new film cameras,
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.320]   but they will still support.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.520]   This is kind of one of the things that was
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.200]   misreported when this first came out.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.520]   They're still going to be supporting their old kind of film
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:18.760]   once.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.640]   They're just not going to be in selling them for a little while,
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.320]   you know, maybe another year or a half.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:23.400]   Okay.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.080]   Use those lenses on the digital ones too.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.280]   Yeah, they're all universal.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.120]   Yeah, so why not support them?
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.400]   They're still a lot of your--
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.280]   Yeah, but you know, Canon actually made the smart thing
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.760]   with their DLSRs, DSLRs, which was to develop lenses
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.560]   specifically form, whereas Nikon really took a while
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.360]   to figure that out.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   They had Nikon stuck with them.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.400]   What we're going to use are lenses.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.040]   They're universal.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.480]   You can use them on the old film camera,
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.160]   and you can use them on the new camera.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.680]   And it's a really dead end because those old film cameras,
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.360]   I mean, everyone's going to stop making them.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:52.920]   Let's face it.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.960]   Those things are--
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.120]   They adopted that lens mount a couple of years.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.640]   That was a big step for them.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.080]   You had to go buy new lenses.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.240]   Canon or a couple years back?
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.080]   And it's a smart mount, right?
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.800]   So it has the sensors built in and all that stuff.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.560]   Yeah, I mean, you know, I've got two or three.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.280]   I mean, I love them.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:08.760]   They're great.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.360]   And I'm not even a pro photographer.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:10.680]   It's just--
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.920]   It's interesting to see how Canon has really moved forward
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.320]   in the digital market to kind of take first place
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.560]   and put Nikon kind of in the back seat a little bit.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.320]   It is interesting.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.640]   Although I have a Nikon D70, and I love it.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.200]   Me too.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.320]   It's my favorite camera.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:23.880]   Oh, I love it.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.520]   You have a D70, a film camera?
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.480]   No, no, no.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.600]   The D70.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.880]   So there's this thing called digital.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.840]   Oh, the digital D70.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.560]   Digital D70.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.400]   I think of the N70.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.120]   Now the D70.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.040]   D per watt Mossberg is now D for digital.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.560]   Oh, well, it's anyway.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.120]   Well, it's Walt's 70.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:38.600]   It's 70.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.320]   It must be true.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.160]   But you're using-- you're using a D70.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:41.720]   Isn't that kind of--
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.280]   Mm.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.240]   No, it's good.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:43.800]   It's a fairly--
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.400]   It's a little high end for a DSLR,
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.600]   and I'm not a pro photographer,
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   but I, you know, it's so worth it.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.360]   The colors just are wonderful.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.880]   But I will say it is a lot easier.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.280]   I have found to swap out the Canon lenses.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.240]   Is it?
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.800]   Like, just the mount is a little less tricky than the Nikon.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.960]   Yeah, you know, I've shot with both those cameras.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.720]   The Nikon high end and the--
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.160]   And the Canon, I think--
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.320]   I hate to say it because I've never been a big fan of them.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.600]   And I have the Nikon.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.000]   I have an old N80 and I used to have an F4.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.400]   I have to say, I think the Canon stuff is unbelievably great.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:13.880]   Really?
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.600]   See, I thought the D70 looked better than the Rebel.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.440]   Because to me, it was between the D70 and the Rebel,
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.800]   because that was a similar price point.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.720]   And I wasn't going to go all the way up to like the EO.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.880]   Yeah, the D70 was a Rebel killer.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.400]   Yeah, so the D70 to me was--
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.520]   Yeah, the Rebel XT is very good.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.560]   Is that what you have, Michael?
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.240]   Yeah, you know, I actually bought one of those
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.400]   and then sold it right away and bought a D10 and then a D10.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.560]   Yeah, they're great cameras.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.360]   And I think the XT, you're right, John,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:40.200]   that the first Red Digital Rebel was a first sub $1,000 SLR.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.280]   And then Nikon comes along with the D70 and says,
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.320]   "See, we can really--"
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.680]   That was great market penetration though.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.480]   I mean, that really was an opportunity for people
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.400]   to get involved in a nice digital camera
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.920]   that they could swap their noises on.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.480]   And then the XT, which was the second generation,
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.400]   Rebel really did a good job.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.560]   Everything was faster, it did a much nicer job.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.200]   I just can't--
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   I just can't--
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.800]   --run the Rebel as a way cooler name.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.600]   Well, you had--
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.880]   Remember, it was at Andre Agassi,
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.480]   it was the-- for a long time was there,
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.680]   it was spokesman for yours.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.440]   The EOS system.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.120]   Any other stories that people have--
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.480]   Well, that just reminds me of the--
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.080]   I got more bogus stories in the morning.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.400]   Yeah, anything else you'd like to make up, John?
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.400]   Years ago in the Conro-L, the Core 2 Duo.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.160]   I mean, oh, did you hear about this?
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.160]   By the way, oh, all right, Delgon and I, keep forgetting to do this,
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.240]   is apparently there's some chip floating around.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.040]   I can't remember the number, it's a 400 series or something like that.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.880]   That's a cheap chip.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.160]   I got to get the details on this.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.320]   But apparently you can-- you can overclock this thing
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.480]   and you apparently turn on a dual core mechanism.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.960]   And the next thing you know, you got like a $1,500 chip for $100.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.160]   Intel's done this before, you know,
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   because of the way they've been sort of their chips.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.640]   They-- and it's-- and they're so good, frankly,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.160]   their manufacturer process is so good
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.440]   that they don't have slower chips.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.880]   So the-- in the old days, remember,
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.800]   you could overclock the Celerons like crazy.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.120]   And I think that that's-- Intel's known for, in fact,
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.960]   taking, you know, one die and modifying traces and stuff
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.200]   and making it be a-- a-- a stupider chip.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.280]   You know, one of my readers sent me a link to this store
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.960]   and I'm going to just request that they do the--
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.480]   sent it to me so I can post it,
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.040]   because I-- for some reason I dropped the ball on this story
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.960]   and I just can't remember any of the details
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.760]   and I need to get the link.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.760]   The highly overclockable hackable Intel chip.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.920]   I think it was covered on Tom's hardware.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.720]   All right.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.680]   We'll see if we can find it.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.960]   We can find it in detail.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.080]   I'm sure you'll be daily-ugest at devorect.org.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.360]   We'll actually-- you know what I really need?
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.280]   What I really need from-- I need to-- you know,
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.480]   in Reiki of Victor's a hard rock cafe,
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.000]   I believe it's still there.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.080]   And I need to get my-- I had a sweater that I bought there,
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.840]   which says hard rock Reiki of Victor.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.520]   And it's a sweater.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.680]   It's the only place I know that has sweaters.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.040]   Everybody else sells t-shirts and sweatshirts and whatever.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:38.840]   Well, it's like a one.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.520]   You need a sweater.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.480]   Nice Icelandic sweater.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.680]   But it's so old since I haven't been there for so long.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.600]   I need somebody to get me-- I'll pay for it.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.280]   But I need somebody to get me a new one.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.760]   I'm sure we can arrange that.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.080]   And there's got to-- we have to have at least one Icelandic listener.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.920]   We do, because I cannot offend them.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.400]   I don't know the Icelandic accent.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.120]   So we actually haven't chased off our Icelandic listeners yet.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   It's probably like, gababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:14.920]   It's probably like a big, big, big, big.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.320]   Can you just do it in following?
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.080]   You'd be rich if you could do that, Joe.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.360]   Did this O'Reilly trademark web 2.0?
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.600]   I think we did talk about that.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.760]   And we should talk about that.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.040]   I'll talk about that, man.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.920]   We're talking about Walt Mossberg and Dee.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.640]   I wonder if he registers Dee as a trademark, and none of us
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.920]   can use the letter D again.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.280]   So O'Reilly-- actually, it really isn't--
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.520]   I don't blame O'Reilly on this.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.000]   I blame IDG conferences.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.160]   But IDG conferences does a conference with O'Reilly
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.520]   called web 2.0.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.840]   Apparently, some small--
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.960]   Which is available on IT conversations, by the way.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.080]   Thank you very much.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.480]   But some small-- I don't know who it was,
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.760]   but some small European--
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.000]   I think it was in Ireland, wasn't it?
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.240]   They were going to do a conference.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.040]   Yeah, actually in non-profit.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.240]   Non-profit in Ireland wants to do a web 2.0.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.920]   And they get a cease and dis--
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.800]   Yes, that's right, and never club seals.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.760]   And they got a cease and desist letter.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.880]   But now, people blamed O'Reilly.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.880]   And I think it's IDG.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.600]   Well, I'd never put the key bar on it.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.760]   It's Tim O'Reilly that invented the term,
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.280]   so he could have stopped it.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:11.960]   Well, they trade more.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.480]   And that's right.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.360]   In fact, Tim O'Reilly was invited to the conferences,
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.120]   I remember.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.040]   Well, that's what they say.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:16.880]   Well, Tim O'Reilly--
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.160]   The next thing you know, the guys are sued.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.960]   Tim O'Reilly and John Battelle from FM Publishing
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.600]   put that conference together.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.560]   And then I think they sold it, if I'm not mistaken, to CMP.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.560]   Is that right?
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   It was a CMP.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.560]   It's a joint service mark.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.240]   It is a joint service mark between O'Reilly and CMP.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.000]   But CMP filed for it, I think, in the first place.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.600]   Yeah, they actually filed for the registration.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.040]   And, of course, as you know, if you did--
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.080]   But O'Reilly is still very much involved with the conference.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.040]   And I think people got so worked up about this
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.360]   because they sort of hope that O'Reilly--
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   They want Tim O'Reilly, who's double.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.440]   --because they loved him.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.280]   And they hoped that O'Reilly wouldn't be involved in this kind
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:51.800]   of thing.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.440]   And it felt like the man coming down a little guy.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.240]   And, of course, it happened while Tim was on vacation,
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.280]   just to make life worse.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280]   Conveniently.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.360]   And, of course, the worst thing is it happened a week
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.200]   before the conference.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.960]   So it wasn't the kind of thing where you gave them fair warning.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.200]   By the way, I don't know if the IT conversations has this
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.920]   or who has it, you can look it up.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.720]   But the last-- I think it was the last Web 2.0 show.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.120]   There was a keynote given by Bruce Sterling.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.200]   It's a great keynote.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.840]   That is absolutely a great keynote.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.280]   He's really the best things I've ever heard for a long time.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:23.880]   I've heard it.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.840]   I think I heard it on IT conversations.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840]   I think it is.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   I'd recommend listening.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.520]   Just go to ITconversations.com.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.440]   So you guys do have that kind of a truncated version.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   You don't have the whole thing.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   Got the whole thing.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   Every word, every style.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.880]   I would recommend you go there and get a copy and put it
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.280]   on one of your iPods or something.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.680]   Because it's really an excellent summation from--
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.240]   Sterling is kind of a cynical guy in a funny way.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.880]   But he's not as bad as we are.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.240]   But typically, he's got some interesting observations.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.280]   A little off the wall.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.800]   And I have to say, this was an outstanding speech.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.240]   Three words, tour de force.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.080]   Or is it--
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.520]   I don't know if it does or--
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.440]   Unless you're Walt Mossberg and then Steve.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.800]   That's technically three words for me.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.440]   I thought the interesting thing with that story
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.640]   was how it kind of exploded in the blogosphere
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.600]   and turned from a letter to a lawsuit
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.440]   and just people were feeling very typical response
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   from the blogosphere.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.160]   I know Tim O'Reilly wrote this letter when he finally
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.760]   did come back from vacation and said, sort of,
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.120]   explain the whole kerfuffle.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.440]   And then said, I'm really disappointed, essentially,
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.120]   in the blogosphere.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.960]   And this whole experience has sort of shaken my faith
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.280]   in the collective intelligence of the blogosphere.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.680]   And I thought, have you ever been to the blogosphere?
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.000]   Yeah, this happened.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.160]   I mean, that's what they do is what they live for.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:37.680]   I don't disappoint.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.080]   You don't have a drink with Dan Rather.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.400]   And you know, it's--
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.880]   God, relax.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.560]   Like, rule number one of getting a trademark.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.960]   Have a drink with John Horack.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.120]   I mean, you see somebody use it.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.960]   If you're getting involved with the blogosphere,
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.880]   expect the worst.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.280]   Expect the worst from the blogosphere.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.880]   Because they don't have their names attached
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.040]   to their little accounts.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.600]   The funny thing is that it will rather
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.200]   should get over it because it's like getting mentioned on dig.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.320]   You get a big spike.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.000]   Two days later, you're forgotten.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.660]   Right.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.040]   I've never seen things turn over so fast.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.560]   Welcome to the new world.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.200]   I mean, I think it's way everything is.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.800]   We have short attention span theater here.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.560]   What we're talking about--
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.000]   I just started up outside in the house.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   And then I'm going to go have dinner, too.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   All right.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.960]   We've all just lost interest to Molly Wood, who gets the prize
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.000]   for the first tweet to use the word kerfuffle in a sentence.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.120]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.360]   I was going to say something.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.040]   From, of course, Buzz Out Loud and CNET.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.320]   And it is buzzoutloud.cnet.com.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:37.680]   Is that?
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.320]   There's that.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.400]   And then buzz.cnet.com is kind of home of all the buzz,
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.120]   which is--
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.920]   She's the buzz at.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.160]   The video podcast and the blog and the call on that.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.360]   Is that the meaning to call you a buzz at?
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:47.960]   A buzz at.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.480]   It's better than a buzzer.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.720]   It is a little bit better than a buzzer.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.800]   She's the buzzer at buzz.cnet.com.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.240]   Buzz in there.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:54.960]   Thanks for having me.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.440]   Thanks.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.760]   It's great to have you.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.640]   Please come back any time you want, Molly.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.120]   Thank you.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.640]   We love to.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.480]   We love having you on.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:00.840]   Thanks.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.560]   Take care.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.640]   josseedevorectevorect.org/blog.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.480]   And don't forget pcmag.com and mark it at Watch.com.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.800]   How could we forget?
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.240]   Any books coming out?
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.480]   Anything in New York City?
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.400]   I'm working on-- in fact, we're going to have to do a special.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   I'm working on my deconstruction of the boom and bust
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.960]   cycle of the US economy, which should be--
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.720]   I would love to read that.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.880]   Yeah, you're going to get a kick.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.800]   It's going to be a monograph, so it's not going to be that long
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.840]   and be about 90 pages.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.800]   John claims that we're in the boom cycle, but about 2000--
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.440]   Boom cycle.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.280]   No, the boom cycle should start next year in 2007.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.240]   And by 2009, it's all over.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.000]   Burtos, yeah.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.800]   October.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.280]   It's in a perfect world.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.640]   It would actually be in October.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.800]   But these things sometimes shift a little bit,
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.280]   which I discussed quite a detail.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.640]   Is that why the crash of '29 was in October?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.720]   There's something about October?
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.920]   Actually, if you start looking at crashes,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.520]   a lot of them take place either.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.320]   Some of them take place in the spring, a few of them.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.120]   But so many of them take place in October.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.600]   It's really kind of weird.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.080]   It's interesting.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.400]   It has-- the function behind that is manifold.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.160]   So it's hard to say specifically what causes
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.520]   that phenomenon.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.560]   I think it's probably Canada banding its low priced cameras.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.320]   I would guess.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.920]   The first thing that would strike me--
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.320]   There's no--
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.520]   I'm telling you there are.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.120]   I think they're always going to drop.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:19.960]   You know what?
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.200]   Just to finish on this topic, I've talked to Kodak about this,
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.120]   and they're going to get out of it.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.440]   They got out of their high-end cameras.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.920]   And I think they may have some problems in the low-end too.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.240]   All these guys are scared to death, all these camera companies.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:37.000]   And Canada will be in this boat too of Sony and Panasonic.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.560]   Because what I was told was that Sony and Panasonic
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.320]   have a different model for making money,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.480]   and they have a different model for what their margin should
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.000]   be.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.840]   And the traditional camera companies just can't deal with it.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.440]   The prices are dropping dramatically.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.040]   I mean, they were much lower this year
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.720]   than they were last year for six megapixel cameras, five
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.520]   megapixel cameras.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.440]   I mean, they're just a couple of hundred bucks now.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.840]   Well, I think it's also getting to the point
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.440]   where you're not going to replace them as often as you used to.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.000]   It skyrocketed so quickly.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.040]   But you get to six, seven, eight megapixels.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.520]   Yeah, once you get to--
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.480]   One extra two of them.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.200]   We're saturated.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.760]   Yeah, that's a very good point.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.160]   Although, I'm impressed with how Kodak has managed
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.320]   to turn itself around.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.040]   I mean, here's a company that--
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.200]   I mean, look what happened to Polaroid.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.040]   I mean, they must have been on death storm.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.200]   Well, Kodak's an interesting--
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.240]   I'm going to visit the company.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.680]   I was supposed to go a couple of months ago.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.800]   And last month, I didn't do it.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.400]   But they have this new little cam with the two lenses,
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.440]   which I thought was kind of silly when I first saw it.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.640]   But then I'm hearing more and more good things about it.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.600]   I'm trying to get a copy to look, check it out.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.640]   OK.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.120]   Well, we'll start scouting for a spot in the backyard
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.080]   to bury the gold bars.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.960]   And we'll talk to you at least on the 16th.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.120]   Oh, no, you won't be at Yahoo.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.560]   But maybe we can see you next week on--
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.440]   Yeah, next week.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.560]   Yeah, especially if we can do it from the Apple strums
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.080]   still working on that.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.160]   Thank you, John.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.200]   See ya.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.120]   Bye-bye.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.640]   And he's gone.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.200]   You hear that sound?
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.120]   That's him going.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.120]   Bye-bye.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.040]   And I do want to thank very much--
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.680]   thank Doug and Mike for actually coming here
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:05.280]   to the inner layer of the Twit Sanctum Sanctorum.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.080]   And congratulations, Doug, to your third year
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.480]   as a podcaster without IT conversations.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.240]   Thank you.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.800]   We really should take this opportunity
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.360]   to tell people what it's really like here at the home of Twit.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.560]   But time's short.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.080]   We really just don't have time to finish that off.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.120]   He's sitting on the corner of my bed.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.440]   I'm going to give you some idea.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.120]   Leo, I do want to remind everybody
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.960]   that the podcast Academy is June 15th and 16th at Yahoo.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.840]   Of course, there will be a live recording of Twit
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.560]   on the afternoon of the 16th.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.040]   But we do have some seats left.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.280]   So if you're interested, go to podcastacademy.com.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.960]   And that will get you where you need to go.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.280]   Like I said, do have a few seats left.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.800]   So we hope to see as many of the Twit listeners there
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.320]   as we can get.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.440]   And you've got some great.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.520]   It's a two-day conference.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.560]   So it's two days to learn all about podcasting,
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.200]   starting with Michael Gohegan right
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.480]   and early on Thursday morning doing podcasting 101.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.680]   And some of the biggest names besides Michael
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.520]   got Paul Fiani, who is--
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.360]   he's the guy that's the point.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.200]   He's the king of podcast equipment.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.040]   He's the mayor.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.880]   He's the gear guy.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.360]   Doug's going to be doing some seminars.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.120]   It's Don Lobe from Feedburner.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.240]   Tim Birkin, who not only does his own podcast,
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.040]   the podcast Brothers.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.120]   Well, he's the guy who puts together the podcast expo
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:20.640]   right here.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.560]   And that's coming up again in September this year.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.200]   That is right.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:23.840]   That is September.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.080]   But we've also, typically appropriate for Twit,
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.560]   we have a vlogger.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.440]   We have the vlogger, the ultimate vlogger,
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.360]   to close the event will be Eric Rice from erichrice.com.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.400]   Eric Screwd.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.920]   And Eric's always about two years ahead of everybody else.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.000]   So I'm looking forward to hearing what Eric has to say.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.360]   He was doing video blogging well along with everybody else.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.840]   Michael Gohegan, it's great to see you.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.320]   And we don't get you on enough.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.280]   I'd love to see you again.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.120]   Great radio.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.040]   Of course, is the Ultimate Wine Podcast.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.000]   And thank you for the-- I didn't tell John about the bottle
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.840]   of wine.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.640]   That'll be--
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.560]   He's a poor dope guy.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.160]   This is a pinot.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.720]   I don't think I think I'm safe.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.520]   You keep his mitts off.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.800]   That's a good one, too.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.560]   And of course, the Disney podcast and all the other things.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.520]   Yeah, Disneyland.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.360]   Disneyland.com/podcast and real reviews.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.080]   And real reviews.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.200]   I knew I was forgetting something.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:12.700]   Real reviews.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.200]   The book.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:13.840]   All kinds of good stuff.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.320]   Podcast solutions.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:15.840]   Buy the book.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.760]   Buy the book.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.240]   Yeah, we're actually carrying Apple stores now.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.200]   Oh, that's good.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.360]   I know I saw that the other day.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.200]   I was in the Apple store.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.800]   I was going to turn them cover out.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.280]   You know?
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:24.960]   Yes.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.760]   That's the door I go into.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.080]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.480]   And by the way, I want to thank AOL Radio for support
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.520]   for the bandwidth on this podcast.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.360]   And a cash fly as well, who is offered to thank Cash Fly
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.760]   very much because they've offered to carry the Og
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.840]   Vorbis and AAC versions, the kind of off versions
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.440]   of the podcast.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.080]   But a lot of people like them and want them.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.480]   And so the BitTorrent has been working too well.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.800]   So Cash Fly the rescue, as usual.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.200]   I know they rescued the system when
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.480]   their BitTorrent wasn't working too well.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.880]   They're like the cavalry.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.760]   It just comes marching in when you need them.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.080]   And we thank you for being here.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   We saw we took a week off, but I promise you
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.920]   a lot more to come next week.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.280]   We'll let you know about VloggerCon.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.120]   And of course, in two weeks, we'll be at the podcast Academy
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:09.800]   June 16.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.200]   And we hope we'll see you there at that live broadcast.
