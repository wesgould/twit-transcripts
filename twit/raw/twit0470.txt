[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.320]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.880]   And always have a lot of fun doing it.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.040]   Hey great to have Rob Reed back here.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   Wonderful to be here.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.760]   Rob is an entrepreneur founded Rhapsody many moons ago.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   He might have seen his incredible TED talk on copyright math.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.520]   And his most recent book is called Year Zero.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   It is.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.000]   The year in which the aliens discover the welcome back cotter theme and realize that
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.960]   humanity makes the finest music in the entire universe since the dawn of time.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.160]   However they owe a little bit of money for pirating.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.240]   Yes, they inadvertently, because they are so passionate about our music, they inadvertently
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.440]   commit the biggest copyright infringement since the Big Bang, thereby bankrupting the
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.560]   entire universe.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.840]   Quite possibly based on a true story.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.640]   It's great to have you, background.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.040]   Also from Paris, France, it's in Virens nearby.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   Patrick Bejard, not Patrick.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.040]   Patrick during the day works for Blizzard, France, but at night he has been known to
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.760]   make a podcast or two at PatrickBejard.com.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.080]   I have.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.000]   Let me say right now I do not represent Blizzard, France at all.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.240]   So just to make this year very mandatory disclaimer.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   We might as well just say it.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   None of us do.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   I don't either.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.160]   Not a one here will represent Blizzard, France during this conversation.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.880]   So I'm just a podcaster.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.120]   Anybody was anybody at all tempted to go to Black Hat or Def Con this week?
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.640]   This is the week of the hackers convening in Las Vegas.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   I was personally offline or largely offline for six weeks working on my second novel.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Oh!
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   I was...
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   How exciting.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   In an undisclosed location in the Great Lakes Riviera.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520]   I didn't go to anything.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   Were you in Michigan?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.520]   I was in Michigan.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   Yeah, no, it's beautiful up there.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.080]   It is beautiful up there.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   And interesting.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.880]   So you felt that in order to write this novel you would have to sign off social media, sign
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.880]   off the internet.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.560]   It was an experiment.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.720]   And I think it worked well enough.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.840]   I got enough done that I'm going to probably do it multiple times over the coming year.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.480]   I got probably 15,000 words written.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.920]   Which is a big chunk for me.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   How many?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.920]   Six weeks?
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   I've had six weeks.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   I also wrote the outline of the book.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   So there was more than just that going on.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.320]   And I'm going to probably try to do that every couple of months.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   What a good idea.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   Take an email vacation.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   So now you're a novelist.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   Now a novelist.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   This is the new thing.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   This is the new thing.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320]   Awesome.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   I was thinking, do I want to start another company or write another book?
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   That was easy.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   Starting a company hurts.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320]   I'm going to tell you.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   Having written a few books.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.080]   Writing a book is the worst thing I've ever done.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.320]   So it must be terrible starting a company.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320]   You've done it.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   I personally prefer to start companies do writing books.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.480]   That's how bad writing is for me.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.040]   Well, to each his or her own.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   Exactly.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   What's the new book about?
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.280]   It is going to be about an imaginary startup.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.600]   And it is actually a thin connective tissue with your zero, the book about the aliens.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.560]   In that book, there was this imaginary social network called Flutter, P-H-L-U-T-T-R.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.600]   And I do have the URL.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.040]   So don't try to grab that.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.120]   It was just embodied everything that's bad about social media.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.160]   And everybody just thought it was the most wonderful thing.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.520]   It was like, infest your phone and figure out everything about you and blather it to
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520]   the world.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.280]   And it was kind of like a playful little plot device.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.120]   Well, I started thinking, it'd be really fun to write a book about a startup, an imaginary
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.800]   startup, in a similar playful science fiction voice to the last one.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.880]   It's like, well, what startup?
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   I was like, Flutter.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.800]   So it is going to be the story of Flutter.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.280]   I was thinking of calling it Flutter, colon, the study, story of Flutter.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280]   But nobody knows how to spell Flutter.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.280]   How about Son of Flutter?
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.320]   Son of Flutter could be that.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   Or year zero two.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   That was another year.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.320]   The Flutter years.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.360]   But it won't be a sequel to year zero.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   It'll be just sort of written in the same very general universe.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760]   But it won't be about music, adult aliens.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   That'll be fun.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   It will be fun.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   We loved year zero.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   Everybody who read it just loved it.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.520]   Oh, and speaking of which, I told the folks at Random House that I was going to be on
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   the show.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.680]   And I asked them, could you do a price reduction of the Kindle version of year zero for this
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   very week?
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.840]   Because here we are.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.560]   And they have reduced the price to $2.99.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   On Amazon?
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.920]   Only on Amazon for the Kindle.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.460]   And I believe on all electronic platforms, I believe on the Nook, on the iBook store and
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.460]   so forth.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.960]   As if there are any other platforms.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   As if.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   All right, fair enough.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   We love them all.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.440]   Actually, we're going to, one of the reasons we have you on, we want to talk about the
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.160]   900 author revolt.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   There it is, $2.99.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   That's really good.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   And it's really good.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   Live like a day or two ago.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.360]   So if you haven't read it, Kindle it.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   Kindle it.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.160]   Not year zero, a history of 1945.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.320]   No, there are a lot of books called year zero, not the Nine Inch Nails album.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.080]   But a lot of confusion about that too.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.640]   Year zero, a novel by Rob Reed.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.760]   You'll know you have the right one when you see the alien listening to music on the cover.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.120]   Actually I'm going to change tack.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.720]   I was going to start with the hacker revelations at Defcon and Black Hat.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   But you know, you mentioned social media.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:15.160]   I think this has been the summer of negative news about social media in many respects.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   This week we learned that secret whisper and other social secret social media networks
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.960]   have hired a company in the Philippines to screen all of the messages to make sure there's
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.440]   no bullying or harassment going on.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:39.640]   A Facebook decided to split Facebook and Messenger and a lot of hue and cry over the privacy
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   issues with Messenger.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.160]   Four Square and Swarm also split.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   This has been an interesting summer for social media.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.200]   I actually deleted Facebook and Facebook Messenger from my phone.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.760]   This week Facebook, it's not, I don't know if it's happened to everybody, but it happened
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.840]   to me.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.880]   Starting Wednesday, if you were using the Facebook app on your smartphone, it said, "Sorry, you
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   can't use Messenger anymore.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.160]   You have to get a separate app, download Messenger."
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.400]   So I did.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.680]   And then I found I couldn't turn off notifications for more than a few hours and little chat
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.200]   heads kept popping up.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Oh gosh.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   So I just deleted them.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.000]   Can you go offline though on Messenger?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Well, I actually got some help.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.200]   And this is, we're going to make this a little tip from the radio show.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.240]   You can't, in the Messenger app, you go to turn off notifications.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.600]   I'm actually going to show it to you because it's so annoying.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.040]   You go to turn off notifications or it's a Messenger app.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.800]   I reinstalled it just so I could demonstrate this.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.640]   If you go into notifications and you say, "I want to turn them off," you go off, it says,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.920]   "Okay, we'll mute notifications.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.480]   Would you like it to be for one hour or until 8 a.m.?
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   Whoa.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.680]   That's your choice.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.320]   Now every other app I've ever used would say, I don't--
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.600]   That's the general everything, right?
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   To mute everything.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   Can't you just mute each of them individually completely by unchecking them?
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   No.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   Here's the checkbox.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.960]   You can turn off notification previews, vibrate, light, sound.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.480]   You could choose a ringtone and you could have a free call vibrate on ring, but you
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.160]   can't disable any, granularly any of these.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.600]   And if you do the off, it says, "Oh yeah, great.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   No problem.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.400]   I'm going to do it for an hour or until next tomorrow morning, which would you prefer?"
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.880]   Now that was enough for me to uninstall it because I don't want chat heads pop.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.120]   By the way, I started having chat heads pop up on other apps.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   Oh my God.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.440]   It had turned my Android phone into that horrific Facebook home phone.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   This is sold.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   That is incredible.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.080]   I mean, like there's so many things that are wrong about that, but I think what offends
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.360]   me the most is to keep it shut off.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.880]   You would have to get up at 8 in the morning every single day.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.680]   It's not a morning person.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.520]   That alone doesn't seem right.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   It doesn't seem right.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.800]   Somebody very kindly showed me that at least on this phone, and I think this is true on
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.560]   Android in general, in the settings, if you go into the app settings on an Android phone,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.280]   you can say, "I want all notifications turned off for that app."
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.600]   So I'm hoping that that in fact does prohibit this.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.800]   I guess you can globally prohibit it, but that certainly was not Facebook's intent.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.640]   There's a system level thing that allows YouTube to block your phone.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.280]   It's like everything that old and notification issues that kind of this apps.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   It's my fear.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.760]   We'll probably break it.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.920]   This is the OnePlus Onephone, and it has a signage and mod which has this great thing
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.560]   called Privacy Guard.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.720]   When Privacy Guard is enabled, the app will not be able to access personal data like
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.320]   contacts, messages or call logs.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.160]   By turning that on, I'm probably breaking Messenger.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.520]   But I did turn that on and I disable notifications.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.320]   The trouble with that is you have to turn that on at 6 in the morning every day.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   Terrible feature.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.280]   I think that's a reasonable time in wherever Samsung is.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.160]   And people are pointing out, "Well, there's no point in having Facebook Messenger if you
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.040]   don't have notifications, but the way I like to use Facebook is not have it push stuff
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   at me."
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.720]   But when I open it up, I can see what messages people have sent me.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   And now I have to do that.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.960]   And that's not a big deal.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   But I feel like Facebook is as usual pushing it as far as it can until people go, "Hey,
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   wait a minute.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.400]   There are other issues with the new Facebook Messenger."
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.480]   Facebook says it's not our fault, it's Android's fault.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.880]   For instance, among the permissions you give it when you install it are the right to make
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.080]   phone calls without your permission.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:45.480]   They say, "Well, we don't want to, but the Android makes us ask for that right."
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   It says...
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:54.160]   What they're trying to do with that permission, but I think what they said was that they can't
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.200]   change the text for that permission, which makes sense.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.080]   But they're not actually going to be making phone calls without their permission.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.520]   But yeah, as you were saying, there's no option for them to clarify this.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.600]   We've seen that with text messages.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.080]   What they actually want to do.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.000]   We've seen that with text messages where if, for instance, WhatsApp, the way WhatsApp validates
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.160]   your WhatsApp account is it sends a text message to your phone number, which it then can read.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.240]   So it has to both send the message and read it.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.040]   So you have to give a permission to send and receive and read your text messages.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.480]   But it's just for that constrained purpose.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.680]   I don't know what the phone call permission could possibly be.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.600]   Phone calls without your permission.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.520]   That is so weird.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   And then there's the issue of it, and I think other programs do this.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.360]   It tracks you all the time, so it can put your location in.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.000]   Presumably sending that information back to Facebook.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.080]   I don't know if I care about that, but that's another...
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.200]   I mean, the phone's tracking you all the time.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   Also.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:04.800]   Apparently, when there's something called passive listening, Messenger may listen to
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.200]   the first 15 seconds of the audio that's going on while you're writing a status update so
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   that it can say what you're listening to.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   Oh, God.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   In your sentence update.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.560]   So do like a soundhound thing and like, "Yeah, oh."
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   You know.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.920]   The last listening to NSYNC.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:29.160]   Someone on Twitter, Guillaume, is telling me that the permission for the phone call is
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:35.120]   so that you are able to click on call when you're speaking to someone, when you're talking
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.600]   to someone to call them.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.120]   So that's the free calling feature.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   So that's the best.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   So you press call.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   It's really Skype.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   I think.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.320]   You press call and it makes that call.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   So it has to be...
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   The app has to have that permission.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   That makes sense.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.600]   It also, the app has the permission to take pictures and videos with the camera at any time
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.120]   without your confirmation.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.480]   I understand people being scared by this stuff.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.200]   But Facebook says, "No, but we have to say it that way because that's how the text reads
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.760]   in the permission."
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.480]   They say the pictures and videos is so that you can take pictures and videos within the
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.880]   messenger app.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.600]   So the app has to be able to do that.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.160]   Recording audio so that you can send voice messages, make free voice calls and send videos
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   directly.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.280]   So there's reasons for all of this.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.480]   I don't blame Facebook on that.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.200]   It actually really was the notification thing that drove me up the wall.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.000]   So yeah, I guess even for that though, if they knew, you know, they're testing their
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.480]   application, it seems like, "Oh, my video quality is really bad."
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   Yeah, we're losing our own.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   It isn't.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   Sorry.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.240]   But they know their product.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.680]   Hopefully they knew what was going to, how it was going to work and that respect as well.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.680]   And they should have...
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   I don't know.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.760]   Shouldn't they have anticipated that issue and said, "To some people, at least, to the
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.920]   journalists, we know we have these weird permissions that we need to ask for, but this is why we
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.240]   have to ask for them and at least give weapons to the journalists that would see that thing
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.840]   coming to answer the concerns of the public."
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.920]   It seems at least they should have done that.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.840]   The other way to do this is the way iPhone does it, which is on installation it doesn't
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.000]   ask you anything.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.440]   But when the issue comes up in context, in context...
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.840]   And I think that might be a better way to do it than how Android does it.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.920]   They spoke about it on TNT and Mike Posted, Mike Elgin, our new director posted.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:41.040]   The very long list of permissions that Facebook Messenger requires access to identity, contacts,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.720]   calendar, location, SMS, phone, photos, media files, the camera, the microphone, Wi-Fi connection
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.360]   information, device ID and call, and that's pretty much everything.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.200]   Maybe does that leave anything out?
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.280]   So no wonder there's a market for this.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.920]   This is the black phone, which is now on sale, from Silent Circle.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.480]   This is a...
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.200]   It's from Switzerland, so it's got to be good.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   It's got to be good.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   Swiss no privacy.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   Swiss phone.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.800]   As accurate as a Swiss phone.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's the Swiss watch of phones.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Yes.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Secure by design.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.040]   First of all, yes, it's Android, but it's a special version of Android called Private
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.080]   OS.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.920]   It does not allow you, I would guess, certainly doesn't that give you access to any of the
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.320]   Google services, including the Play Store?
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.880]   I presume it does not allow you to download any application, otherwise it wouldn't be
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.000]   a very secure phone.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.840]   It does come with privacy enabled applications.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   Smart disabling.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:42.120]   Which is cool, but you're saying, Neil, no wonder there's a market for that phone.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.120]   Is there really?
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.800]   I mean, there's going to be people who are going to want to buy it, but can we really
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.320]   say there's a market for a phone like this?
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.760]   People are going to be interested in the concept of, okay, I'm going to have a phone
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.720]   that's actually secure and private.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   Cool.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   Now, where's my Facebook?
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.720]   Right?
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   My people.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   Right.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   Maybe not us.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   It doesn't do any of the things you want to do.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   How do I get to the supermarket?
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   Right.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.120]   Where's the gas station?
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.760]   It's cool that that phone exists, and I think it should, but I don't know if it's going
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.720]   to be very successful.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.000]   This is one of the things, one of the kind of the motifs, the light motifs of this summer
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.240]   and social media started with the right to be forgotten in Europe and the European
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   Court.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.480]   Recording Google, requiring Google to delete search results for people who requested it
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.080]   because they don't want the world to remember that they went bankrupt or they had molested
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.320]   children or whatever it is they didn't want people to know about.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.680]   It strikes me that the internet and smartphones especially are not private and that if you
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.560]   try to make them private, you break them.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.880]   Is that the case?
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:58.000]   Well, it's an interesting, it's kind of a duel between privacy anonymity and the services
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   that people want to access.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.920]   And there's an interesting debate going on about secret and so forth about whether anonymous
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.520]   speech is something that's almost, they don't quite put it this way, but it's almost a question
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.080]   that some people are posing of whether anonymous speech is something that's worth protecting.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.280]   And I think that that debate has for all intents and purposes bubbled up in Pando daily in some
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:23.240]   other places as people have been debating those kinds of services.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.600]   And yeah, if you try, the black phone is a great case in point, it will be very interesting
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.440]   to see if it does succeed because getting that great degree of privacy will inevitably
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.240]   result in a far less functional phone.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.840]   And it'll be interesting to see how these things play out in the marketplace.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.000]   Somebody in the chat pointed out, I'm sure this is the case that the Facebook messenger
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   requires no more permissions than Google's own Hangouts app than WhatsApp.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.680]   Yeah, I mean any messaging program is going to require those.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.240]   It's the nature of messaging.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I sometimes think that we in the tech press community get more agitated about these issues
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.160]   than the general public does.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.440]   I remember there was an interesting story.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.280]   Even one of the sort of privacy things kicked up about Facebook, they were asking somebody
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.040]   to survey and basically asked X hundred or X thousand people, what would you be willing
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.800]   to sell more or less unbounded access to your personal information for?
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   And most people are like, yeah, three or four bucks.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   Right.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   Most people want to know that much.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   You know what people want?
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   They want control.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   Yes.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.960]   What they don't, it's not necessarily that they wouldn't give it to you, but they want
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   to control it.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.400]   And for instance, Google now is a great value to me in order for that to work.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.800]   Google has to know more than more than a little about my whereabouts and what I'm doing, but
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.960]   I find it very useful.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960]   It's fascinating.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.960]   So that's a fair trade.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.800]   It's fascinating when it comes up with an amazing message like your flights late, right?
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   Or there's a traffic jam between here and the airport.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   Right.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   We see you're at the airport.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.200]   Here's your check in exactly all that stuff.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.520]   It's a very useful.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.980]   That's a lot of the very important piece of information that's lost in a lot of those
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.280]   debates about privacy.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:09.520]   As you were saying, Rob, it's well, both of you actually, it's completely part of that
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.960]   package, right?
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.100]   If you want to protect your privacy, you are going to lose all of these functionalities.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:24.940]   But the problem is in the tech community, we often focus on the privacy aspect and say
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.980]   it's important to protect all of this.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:39.220]   But we don't explain to the people that we are yelling these problems to that if they
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.420]   want to go the privacy route, they're going to lose all of these functionalities.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.700]   And that's definitely a problem.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:53.460]   And I think the key piece of information to take away from this is what you were mentioning
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.500]   the control.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.180]   And that's where the real issue is.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:07.380]   A lot of these companies are not willing to give us control of how we provide the information.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:15.260]   And so I fear that by asking for, basically, to summarize my thought here, we're sort of
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.220]   fighting the wrong battle when we're trying to say we absolutely need privacy.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.100]   What we absolutely need is control, not privacy itself.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.980]   And I think that's an important distinction.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.500]   And I think the control to turn off notifications even.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:36.140]   And then also, I think a really vital piece of it is something that you glancingly touched
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.620]   on, but as we're having this conversation, I think it's very important, which is contextual
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620]   notifications.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.140]   What happens is typically you'll sign a EULA and it gives somebody blanket permission
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.940]   to do absolutely everything.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.580]   And it comes at you 90 pages and three point font.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.300]   And nobody reads that.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   Is that notification?
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   Yes.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.300]   Is it transparency?
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   Absolutely not.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.380]   And presenting you the useful information in context, I think that's transparency.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.260]   I don't think like this massive disclosure.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.180]   It's kind of like we walk into any garage in California now, somewhere on the wall,
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.660]   like a huge public parking lot, somewhere on the wall on the third floor is this massive
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:19.260]   notice that says this facility contains elements that could be carcinogenic.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.860]   And it's probably some good natured law that said we need to alert 65 warning.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.860]   It's everywhere.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.860]   It's in California.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.860]   It's everywhere.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.860]   And by doing it, they've completely dulled totally out the impact of these warnings.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.780]   The warning has no impact whatsoever.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.780]   Everything causes cancer.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.140]   So that sign is everywhere.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.260]   It's ubiquity and its sweepingness makes it useless.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:44.980]   I first learned this lesson when I was in fifth grade, we went to a power plant.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.820]   I remember this very well.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.580]   And even this is in fifth grade, this is in the 60s.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.660]   Everywhere in the power plant had signs that said conserve, conserve, conserve, you know,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.700]   be green even in those days.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   Wow.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.460]   And my teacher said, well, they do that for a reason because the more you see it, the
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.180]   less you think about it.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.180]   It's funny.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.180]   It's just like the prop 65.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.180]   Very good insight.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:13.820]   It's the same thing, you know, talking about tech even, we have these horrendous cookies
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:20.700]   disclaimers on all of our websites in Europe now that they all warn you, you know, you
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.980]   have a little bar at the top of the website every so often.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.580]   Hey, by the way, this site uses cookies to improve your experience.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.020]   And you can click, you know, got it or more information and they all have it.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.220]   And you, they don't track all of your IPs all the time.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.580]   So you get them multiple times on every site and it completely losing any effectiveness.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.580]   Well, you ignore it.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.940]   And it's just calling out this is this is cultural though, because in Europe, they're
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.060]   worried about cookies, but you could walk into a vat of benzene and there'd be no warning
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.060]   at all.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.220]   There'd be a little tin cup.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.060]   Say, if you want to drink, please have one on us because they don't that the safety health
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060]   and safety.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.340]   Because Americans go to here, they are stunned by the health and safety regulations.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.340]   Am I wrong?
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.020]   I'm sure in Switzerland, they're very careful.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.900]   And, well, I don't know.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:16.500]   I think, you know, I've, I've spent a little bit of time in Japan and Japan has a lot of
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.780]   that effect on me that you're talking about Americans.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.220]   Like very nervous, very worried about everything.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.220]   Oh, wow.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.220]   Wow.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.220]   Well, no, I mean, no, the opposite.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:30.020]   I was sleeping in wooden houses in Kyoto when I was living there.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.860]   And you would have fuel like gas based heaters.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.820]   And anyway, so yeah, that was not good at all.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.300]   It was very, very frightening.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.940]   But by the way, I should warn you that benzene has been known by the state of California
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   at Cost Cancer.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940]   I think it's important to make that point.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.940]   I just want to make sure we follow the Prop 65.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   What is, what are they?
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.660]   Can I click got it on your forehead?
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.460]   You know, we've actually been thinking, should we have the cookies warning on our twitsite?
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.100]   Because of course we set every site has cookies.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.100]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:08.220]   Warning, this site uses cookies should be, but should, do we need to have it?
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.740]   So long as you can dismiss the warning until eight, the following morning.
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.860]   By the way, do you know how the site knows that you've dismissed the warning?
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.540]   They said a cookie with a cookie.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.540]   So what is the reaction?
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.460]   And the one thing is no one understands it.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.460]   No understands it.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.460]   That's why.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.460]   That's why.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.340]   That's Jeff Jarvis on twig calls a techno panic.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:35.340]   You can't, and this is the same thing with these Facebook messenger warnings.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.980]   The techno panic is, oh my God, all the stuff they could do.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.620]   But what they are going to do is not really so horrible.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:48.460]   What is the reaction in France to this right to be forgotten?
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:55.020]   Is there generally, is it generally understood that this is not possible?
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.460]   So initially, well, not possible.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.460]   I don't know.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.540]   I mean, Google is doing it.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.740]   And initially, don't you just go to Google.com if you want to find something?
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.860]   Because it's only Google.FR.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.820]   Yeah, but of course, but I don't think, I don't know how many people will actually do
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.820]   that.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.660]   They'll just Google something and not find the result that would have been incriminating
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.100]   or that others wanted to have hidden.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.540]   And of course, you know, journalists might still look into that.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:33.460]   But generally, the reaction has been widespread ignorance of any of that issue, except Google
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:43.100]   has been acting on it so diligently and so quickly that they actually provoked very
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.700]   high visibility reactions.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:51.860]   The Guardian and other very big outlets have mentioned it and talked about it and complained
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.860]   about it.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.740]   So there's a fair that was Google's intent, by the way, right?
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.420]   Well, exactly, exactly.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.900]   That's a lot of people are saying actually Google, legally, they were not bound by the
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.620]   decision at that point.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.020]   So a lot of people are saying they went really far, really fast in order to shine a light
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.460]   on the issues that this would cause.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.940]   And now that they have, actually, I think they're not necessarily going to revise the
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.900]   issue right now.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.860]   But there are votes coming up in the next few weeks or months.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.700]   And I don't think people are ignoring the issue in the same way anymore.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:29.740]   At least people understand the consequences of that specific decision and that specific
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:36.860]   route that they would have maybe gone if Google hadn't gone so far in this instance.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.300]   So it's probably a good thing.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.660]   Wikipedia, very upset by it.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.700]   In fact, they've started to replace pages that are blanked by the right to be forgotten
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.900]   on Wikipedia because there's quite a few with notices.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.940]   This page has been deleted or blocked due to the right to be forgotten.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:04.380]   They want to call attention to it because as Jimmy Wales has said, "I had a great quote.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.580]   I can't find it here."
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.740]   But you know, he'd like to have forgotten.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.780]   But of course, and the big, I mean, you've discussed this already, but the big issue is
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:20.140]   that they're not actually, if they legally had a right to go and remove that content,
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.460]   then of course go do that.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:29.060]   But the index, the index and the accession of that content, removing that is very questionable.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.540]   And actually, the EU, you were talking about the notice that Wikipedia is putting up for
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.980]   those pages.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:42.300]   The EU actually gave a call to Google and Bing because when they were accepting removal
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:49.180]   of content to a specific site, they would send an email to the webmaster of that site
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:56.580]   informing them of the removal, which is possibly why the Guardian and others have actually
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.900]   found out or realized the extent to which.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   The EU was calling Google, apparently saying, "You can't do that."
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.420]   Or we need to talk about this because this defeats the purpose.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:15.580]   So I was saying they realize the issue now, but maybe they actually don't quite get it.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:20.780]   I think Google's very, they deleted 91,000 search results, 91,000 pages.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:27.580]   I think it's very cagey, doing it aggressively and early to raise the issue.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:34.540]   Wiki Media had its conference, the annual Wiki Mania conference in London this weekend.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.620]   Here's the quote from Jimmy Wales.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.820]   He called the EU's right to be forgotten as deeply immoral.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:46.700]   He warned the ruling will result in an internet riddled with memory holes, but this was my
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.700]   favorite quote.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.980]   He says, "I've been in the public eye for quite some time.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.060]   Some people say good things.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.060]   Some people say bad things.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.340]   That's history.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.460]   And I would never use any kind of legal process like this to try to suppress the truth.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.780]   History is a human right.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:08.540]   And one of the worst things a person can do is to attempt to use force to silence another.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.300]   And I think that's pretty right on.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.540]   Well another interesting aspect of this is the blowback that some people have unintentionally
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.540]   triggered on themselves.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.620]   Did you hear the story about the guy who wanted to have it forgotten that he went to a Tantric
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.620]   sex workshop?
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.620]   Yes.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.500]   So there was somebody who did a takedown notice of an article from the 90s that mentioned
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.980]   in passing the attended this Tantric sex workshop.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.300]   So of course the Wall Street Journal immediately writes an article about this fact and calls
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.620]   the guy up and interviews him.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.340]   So they could probably draw it a little more attention.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.340]   It's a stress and effect.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.340]   It's a very well-known.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.340]   It's a stress and effect.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.340]   It's yeah.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.180]   "Reached by phone Mr. Linde confirmed that he had asked for the story to be removed from
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.740]   searches for his name because he didn't want to be shadowed online by an article."
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.980]   He feels blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.540]   This could, as in fact, having a material effect on my career, Mr. Linde said of the
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.540]   story.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.060]   Anyway, although I have to point out that Jimmy Wales is quite famous for having apparently
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.660]   trying to disappear one of his co-founders, not actually disappear him, but the story
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.940]   that he had a co-founder.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   Had a co-founder.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.340]   So I don't know.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.340]   Maybe.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.340]   Okay.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.620]   Is there another side to the story though, if we try to take, you know, I'm going to try
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.220]   and be the devil's advocate for just a second, that poor guy who defaulted on his payment
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.460]   in Spain in like 15 or 20 years ago.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.300]   This is the original court case.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.780]   The original case.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:38.380]   The original one where the Spanish court called on the EU to get their decision on the specific
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.820]   aspect of that case.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:48.300]   Should you, because it's not even something bad that you've done, it's just something
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.980]   that happened to you or you were in an unfortunate situation.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:58.020]   Google is go, if that's the only thing that you've ever done or that has your name on
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.220]   the internet, that's always going to come back.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.940]   It's always whenever, you know, no matter what you do.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:09.980]   And there might be some public records there that you can't really go to and ask them to
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.860]   remove because it's public record and it's important to have the public records as well.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:21.020]   But the effect that Google has is that it makes this one thing that is on the internet
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.700]   the sum of your life, right?
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:29.820]   So isn't there an argument to maybe not the right to be forgotten to be enforced in that
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:35.580]   specific way, but isn't there an argument to be made that maybe that is also not a good
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.140]   thing and we should try to address it somehow?
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:43.220]   But is it Google's job or is it your job to create more stuff so that it's not the only
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.380]   thing that appears on the internet?
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.500]   Or Lisa Pop's song immediately.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.980]   Two more stuff.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.980]   I agree.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   It's not fair.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:56.340]   Of course, to further your point, Patrick, Google does exercise maybe it's algorithmically
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.860]   but editorial judgment about what your life is.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.020]   It decides what search results are important about you and what aren't.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:10.660]   It says, well, it's done by an algorithm that is completely unbiased and so forth.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.940]   But I think any algorithm has bias built into it.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:18.900]   And it's also an algorithm that is constantly tweaked and always very controversial when
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.900]   it happens.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.940]   They are constantly modifying the algorithm.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.260]   Well, they just modified it to bump up the sites that we're using HTTPS.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.260]   There you go.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.420]   That's now, while we all think that's a good thing, that's an example of editorial control.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.300]   And as soon as Google does that once, then it is now exerting some editorial control
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.540]   over your search results.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:46.340]   And they are so all powerful in terms of driving traffic to sites that their editorial
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.820]   judgment about whether encryption or sort of policy judgment almost has the effect of
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.700]   enforceable government policy.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.860]   It becomes so powerful because they are so significant.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.500]   And in this particular case, I think, yeah, more encryption is great.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:03.780]   But it gives you, they're almost in a position or they aren't in a position to de facto regulate
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.780]   the internet.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.780]   It's just fascinating.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:12.100]   So just so you know on this story, just so you know, Google has decided that among
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.780]   all the signals it accepts to rank pages, it's going to add another signal whether the
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:23.580]   page is using strong encryption or HTTPS by default, which most pages, ours does not,
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:29.460]   most pages don't because there's no reason for me to encrypt the data that I'm sending
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.500]   to you until now.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.260]   But now there is.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260]   And I agree.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.940]   I mean, we, we, we on security now, we've talked about the, this idea of HTTPS everywhere.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:45.700]   It wasn't done originally because of the overhead, the calculation overhead and now computers
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.940]   and servers are fast enough more than fast enough.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.940]   It really isn't a penalty or much of a penalty for securing the traffic.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.100]   But there is an expense.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.740]   You have to get a secure certificate.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.740]   That's not free.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.740]   Right.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.580]   It's hundreds and hundreds of dollars in some cases, thousands of dollars.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.140]   There's no reason for me to encrypt the traffic that's coming to you from Twit or any of
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.620]   my pages or encrypt your traffic to me.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:13.060]   So that's an interesting thing that Google's imposing on us.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.620]   It's actually enacting shaping.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.580]   I think, you know, you were talking about editorial control that Google has.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.940]   This is, it causes an even bigger question.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.140]   They're actually influencing the architecture on the internet.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.980]   In this case, we're super happy that they're doing it for the right reasons and in the
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.220]   right way.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:42.380]   What about, you know, they decide that they are going to bump up the sites that use VP9
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.580]   or how's it called?
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.140]   They're their expert.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   They're video coding.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.140]   They're so called.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.140]   On a covered video.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.140]   Or use Google.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.420]   So we've always thought that we've always thought, hey, Google may promote YouTube over,
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.340]   say, daily motion, which is a French video site.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.300]   They may promote Google plus over Facebook.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.380]   And Google, I think, tries very hard not to do that.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.460]   It's always the risk as Google gets into businesses besides search that some of their
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.140]   businesses will compete with other people on the internet.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.060]   I guess there's always been the fear and I trust Google.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.900]   You know, I use Google for everything.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:24.380]   But and I actually think that they're out there to, in some ways, while making a lot
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.500]   of money, they do have initiatives that seem to be furthering the common good.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.300]   But that being said, I'm just saying that.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:42.260]   But here, they're stepping into actually shaping the internet's technical infrastructure and
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.660]   through their algorithm.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.220]   I think they've done that before.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.220]   A little bit.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.740]   But it's a fact to regular, it gives them a weird.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:58.100]   It's a very light weight signal affecting fewer than 1% of global queries and carrying
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.900]   less weight than other signals such as high quality content while we give webmasters
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.220]   time to switch to HTTPS.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.940]   But over time, this is Google writing, we may decide to strengthen it because we'd like
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:17.100]   to encourage all website owners to switch to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.820]   That's pretty heavy handed.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.500]   Do any of us would want them not to do it?
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.180]   I'm happy they're doing it.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.340]   I think there are a lot of sites, in fact, probably the vast majority of sites that gain
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   nothing by encryption.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.100]   I mean, I'd certainly want my Gmail encrypted and it is.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.500]   Facebook should be encrypted.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   Facebook should be encrypted.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   Anything that contains credit card is.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   And it is.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.540]   Any financial site should be and is.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.860]   Yeah, I don't think it's a bad thing.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.820]   It seems like they're doing it for the right motivations.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:51.060]   But my guess is that most of the traffic that we would want encrypted is already anyway.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.140]   It's very odd.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.140]   It is kind of.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:57.060]   So but this is this points out the complexity of all of this of the right to be forgotten
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.620]   of Google's role in this.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.940]   There is an editorial role.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:06.540]   I feel bad for people who, you know, the sole search result is something negative.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.700]   They may be Mahatma Gandhi in their real.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.820]   I mean, Gandhi may not have published a lot of websites in his time.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.980]   And maybe the one thing you'd find is some nasty page that was written about him.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   That's terrible.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.580]   And I don't know how you solve that.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.340]   Yeah, he was laid on a credit card payment.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.540]   And I saw that he was late and it was in the news.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.900]   And yeah, first thing that comes up, you know, it's I doubt Gandhi had a web page, but I
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.700]   may be wrong.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.700]   Let's take a break.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.700]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.540]   Rob Reed is here, founder of Rhapsody and a novelist.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.060]   Now he's taken the novelist turn.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.620]   Read Rob read our EID.com.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.700]   If you want to know more about his books, including years zero, his most recent and soon
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.940]   a new one soon, a new one.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.940]   Untitled.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.980]   Rob Reed's next project.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.020]   And also Patrick Bejah from Not Patrick Duck.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.020]   Is it not Patrick?
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.020]   No, it's Patrick Bejah.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.020]   Oh, it's Patrick Bejah Duck.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.980]   Not Patrick on the Twitter.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.980]   That.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.380]   And his new apartment, which is beautiful.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.380]   Isn't it wonderful?
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.380]   Lovely.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.540]   I have a Japanese copper carving in the back.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.540]   Very.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.300]   That like very Parisian.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.980]   It's all white.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   You obviously have the.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.940]   Yeah, that's the you have neither children or small dogs.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.940]   It's the Finnish wife influence.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.940]   Yeah, it's very old white and wood.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:24.940]   Scandinavian.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.940]   Yes.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.180]   Are sure they brought to you by a great company called Atlassian and their project management
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.980]   solution JIRA.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.980]   J-I-R-A.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.380]   It's for teams planning, building and launching great products.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.580]   You probably heard about it.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:45.820]   It's one of the world's most powerful and customizable issue and project management systems.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:51.260]   So if you're building a great big app or just a little iOS app, it'll easily capture, organize
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.420]   your workflow.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.940]   Keep your team on the same page so you can prioritize, take action on what's important.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.700]   Keep up to date with what's going on with you.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:06.100]   Many companies, in fact, 25,000 companies use JIRA, including 70% of the Fortune 500.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.100]   NASA uses JIRA.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.660]   JIRA integrates beautifully with Git so you can follow your code from development to delivery
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.460]   on the same system.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:22.060]   They have hundreds, thousands of JIRA plugins, all sorts of stuff to add to JIRA.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.740]   And of course, because they have a great REST API, you can add plugins of your own.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.260]   Flexible and simple enough for a five person start up powerful and reliable enough for
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.900]   a 100,000 person enterprise.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.900]   JIRA.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.900]   Now you've heard about it.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.300]   You've probably wondered, "Why aren't we using JIRA?"
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.740]   Well, now you can free for 30 days.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   Very affordable.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.140]   Monthly plans started at $10 a month for up to 10 users.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:51.140]   Check it all with JIRA via email chat @mentions, RSS.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.140]   It's fantastic.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.300]   JIRA is from Atlassian.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:59.060]   Go to Atlassian.com/twit to learn more and try it free.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:04.540]   Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N Atlassian.com/twit.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.020]   Great company, great product.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.500]   Very, very well known.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.820]   In many circles, we were talking earlier about Mojang using it for their bug track
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.820]   for Minecraft.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.500]   I actually had to use it just the other day.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   We didn't.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   You're going, "I'm using JIRA."
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.500]   I did.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.380]   I had to check on a bug with Obsidian.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:26.620]   Sure enough, I found myself checking in in their bug tracker which is run by JIRA.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.620]   We tried to get Steve Gibson on this episode, but he'll be talking on Tuesday about bad
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.620]   USB.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:40.000]   We'd been hearing about this before, but the Black Hat conference finally revealed the
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.600]   details of the bad USB hack.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.700]   Father Robert Ballisare who was there, and he'll be talking about it on Twi.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.860]   He said it was the talk of the conference.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.540]   Very active, very interesting Q&A afterwards.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.960]   It's stunning, hard to believe.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:05.200]   The researchers who discovered bad USB found that almost all USB devices, including most
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:11.580]   USB keys, most USB drives, have reprogrammable firmware with the right hardware, which is
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.580]   widely available, easy to get.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:20.860]   You can modify the firmware to carry a malware payload in such a way that it's undetectable,
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:25.500]   can't be removed, and could bite you bad.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.020]   Sounds very stuck, Snettie.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:34.100]   Well, it's interesting because Stuxnet, which was the virus that infected the Iranian centrifuges
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.280]   where they were enriching uranium for building.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.400]   People thought perhaps nuclear bombs.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.240]   Those centrifuges, they were made by Siemens, right?
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.960]   They used the SCADA system, and they were air-gapped.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.760]   That's a good protection, right?
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.680]   You don't connect these things to the internet because that's how malware gets in.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:03.560]   But unfortunately, for them, not for us, I guess, I think it was probably some governmental
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.940]   agency managed to subvert somebody who worked there, give them a USB key, which, you know,
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:14.860]   thumb drives, plugged into the SCADA, modified it, and I think it caused the USB.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:20.020]   It either caused the centrifuges to spin up to such a high rate that they broke or play
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.020]   AC/DC music.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.180]   I'm not sure.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.180]   It was one of those.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.980]   But in either event, it slowed down the enrichment process considerably.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.020]   The difference there is that was an auto-run.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.020]   We believe.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.020]   We don't know.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.840]   This was with Steve last week.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.600]   It's thought, but not known that that might have been an auto-run on those USB keys.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.700]   And, of course, we've known about that for a long time.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.280]   But this is worse because it's in the firmware.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.900]   In the real revelation, I think, had we known this, I don't think it would have been so
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:53.700]   hard to figure this out, the real revelation is that so many thumb drives have reprogrammable
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.700]   firmware.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   No idea.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.700]   Capability.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.540]   They have EEPROMs on them.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.540]   Why?
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.980]   Who would have thought that?
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:07.180]   This is the research comes from SR Labs.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.580]   The details are on their website.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:15.620]   They say the versatility of USB is also its Achilles heel since different device classes
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.700]   can plug into the same connectors.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:23.140]   One type of device can turn into a more capable or malicious type without the user noticing.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.380]   So that's part of the issue is it doesn't, it could be a phone that you're plugging
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:35.260]   in, but it could be seen as a mass storage device and copy data over and so forth.
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:41.700]   And we're back to the balance between security and convenience.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:50.300]   The convenience of the USB, which is what made it so widely used and well-convenient,
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.780]   is what makes this hack possible.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:45:02.340]   And the most frightening thing about all of this is that there is no real solution to
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.580]   there's no fix or at least no easy fix.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.140]   We're going to talk a lot about it.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:13.820]   I'm sure on Tuesday and security now and that's why I wanted to get Steve on, but he's at
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.580]   a pocket as he usually is on Sundays.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.620]   I've seen articles from a lot of people saying, "Oh, it's no big deal.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.620]   Don't worry."
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:27.020]   I've seen others say this is the worst thing that's ever happened.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:33.260]   The real question is in the wild because malware and the firmware cannot be detected
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.500]   by normal antivirus programs, we don't know.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:44.260]   Although I think either Norton or McAfee has reported that there have been some bad USB
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.100]   in the wild detected.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.380]   So maybe they've come up with some sort of scanner.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.380]   Go ahead.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:00.180]   Yeah, it's definitely frightening.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.900]   On what you were saying, this is not a big deal.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:11.900]   Hack 5 has built this rubber ducky that basically functions in the same way.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:18.660]   It's a rubber ducky USB key that pretends to be something else, something other than
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.780]   it is, and that allows you to do a bunch of hacky stuff.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.940]   But it's very difficult to figure out who to trust.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:33.140]   Is it really the end of the world or is it absolutely not a big deal?
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:39.140]   It's probably somewhere in the middle, but it doesn't seem benign at all.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   It seems like something serious that could very possibly lead to serious issues and hacks
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.460]   and attacks.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.380]   That being said, it's also very new.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:58.180]   So even though you can't really identify it when you plug in your USB key because the
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:04.980]   virus scanners don't have access to that EEPROM.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:13.500]   And so they can read the contents of that ROM to figure out this is something that shouldn't
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   be on there and remedy it.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:24.380]   They could probably figure out that something weird is happening on your computer and something
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:33.500]   you're going to have different types of viruses using that vulnerability.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.660]   Yeah, that's part of the question is how hard it is to do this.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.940]   You obviously have to have physical access to the USB key.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.940]   Do you need EEPROM burning software?
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.900]   I mean, maybe they did it at the presentation we haven't heard yet.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.780]   We'll find out more about that.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.740]   The other point to be made is that if any company wanted to be malicious, of course,
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:57.140]   there's firmware in everything and it'd be easy enough to bury malware into firmware.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.340]   We're trusting the people we buy our hardware from.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:03.460]   A hundred percent and there'd be plenty of examples of that being misguided trust malware
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.100]   being delivered on a new computer, that kind of thing.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:11.740]   I should also point out that one of the NSA exploits revealed by Edward Snowden Cottonmouth
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:18.740]   3 is a USB hardware implant which will provide a wireless bridge into a target network as
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.500]   well as the ability to load exploit software on a target PC.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.860]   The NSA had this years ago.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.540]   In fact, it may even be the same vulnerability.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.580]   One thing we know the NSA, because we had an analyst.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:36.540]   Unwittingly, I put an NSA analyst on the show last week, Al-Namantano.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.860]   One thing we know for sure, the NSA has very smart people working for it.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:46.260]   His job was to reverse engineer malware, presumably so that somebody in another division
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.340]   at the NSA could then use it.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:53.820]   They have smart people and if this exploit exists, they knew about it at least five years
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:49:00.100]   ago in May 2009, according to the slide presentation, if they didn't create it themselves.
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:06.860]   But if you think about it, if you knew, all you need is the information that there's
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.260]   a programmable firmware in these things and you'd go, "Oh, well, that's a problem, right?"
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.980]   Yeah, that's not something that anyone created.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.700]   That's a fundamental vulnerability of the USB protocol.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:24.380]   It turns out that this is a convenience for manufacturers.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.220]   Manufacturers said, "Well, it's frequently.
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.060]   We're halfway through the production and, "Oh, we got a bug in the firmware.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.980]   We want to be able to not have to throw out all those USBs."
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:37.580]   They could and I imagine they some will use unburnable ROMs, but that's been a feature.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:42.100]   In fact, it's a feature of IronKey, which is one of the most secure USB keys is that
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.820]   you can reprogram the firmware.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.900]   The firmware is updateable.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.900]   Nice.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:55.020]   I think IronKey has addressed this issue with signing and other techniques.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:00.220]   But I imagine that there's no reason why, especially now, you couldn't make a USB key
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.500]   with a ROM that's unmodifiable.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.460]   I think they should put that on the front.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.980]   Can't burn the firmware on the front of the package.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.220]   But you still trust in the person who made the ROM didn't put something in there and
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.220]   manufacture.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.220]   It's the Internet.
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.220]   Well, I bet you can trust because, yeah, you have to trust them because if it happened,
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.420]   the incentive would be bad press.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:27.180]   If it ever happened, they would have a horrible time recovering from it.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.820]   Public opinion once again is our only defense.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:37.340]   Hey, Leo, I actually happened to have some audio recording of the Stuxnet centrifuges.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.340]   Let's hear.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:43.300]   It turns out that what they were actually playing was a tainted love.
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.660]   So they got them to spin on.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:51.260]   This is a joke.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.420]   It got them to spin in such a way that became unstable.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.220]   And it just sounded like tainted love.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:04.260]   It just happened to the soft cell entitled to public performance on every span of the
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.260]   centrifuge.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   What are these?
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.260]   7800 RPM.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.620]   That would be a lot of planes.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.980]   It's actually, these are floppy disks.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   Oh my God.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.660]   Somebody took the trouble.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.940]   Oh, there was a lot of this last year.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.700]   Everyone was doing their own version of the printers.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.700]   The Matrix printers.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.700]   That would sing.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.900]   But only a floppy disk can really get that beautiful, pure-based.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.900]   Man, man.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.700]   It's really hard to get a G sharp out of a printer.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.700]   It really is.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.140]   Oh, but I think there's a lovely new thing.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:45.140]   There's some.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.500]   Whoa.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.940]   Can we get taken that on YouTube?
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.500]   I am now on the floppy disk version of tainted love.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.500]   Let's see if, no, yeah.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.300]   I mean, they don't, they don't have it claimed.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.860]   Normally there's a little thing that's right here that says this is a tainted love.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.820]   I think, by now, tainted love should be one of the songs.
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.340]   There are a few that just really nobody should assert ownership.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.340]   Like Happy Birthday.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.340]   Happy Birthday.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.340]   Happy Birthday Tainted Love.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.260]   I'm going to give you up.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.260]   Shook me all night long.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.260]   There are a few.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.260]   There's a few.
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:17.020]   If you really, nobody should claim a troll property at this point.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.020]   All right.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.900]   Show today brought to you by Sh-- are you ever going to do another TED talk?
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.660]   Because that copyright myth was awesome.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.100]   I'd like to go back and do a follow-up.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.580]   One of these days, I think, I will.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.700]   Do you have to talk to Chris Anderson and beg him, or how does that work?
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.340]   He actually invited me to do the talk, which was great.
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.340]   I have a good report with Chris.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.620]   I've known him for many long years.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:41.740]   And I think it would be really fun, sort of, life-long goal to do a full proper 18-minute.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.540]   Well, that wasn't a full TED talk.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.540]   There was a mini talk.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.540]   It was a mini talk.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   It was five minutes.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.540]   So it was five 18th.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.540]   It was five 18th.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   It was perfect.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.540]   Do you really want all 18 minutes?
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.540]   I didn't have a six minute.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.540]   I didn't have a six minute.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.540]   No.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.540]   I didn't know that it wasn't an 18 minute one.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540]   Oh, my God.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   He's just going, no, no, no.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.660]   I just didn't even notice.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.660]   It's on the TED site.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.660]   You can see it.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.900]   It's on the TED site for robbery.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.900]   Copyright.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:05.900]   Very, very good.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.540]   The $8 billion I'm at.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:09.620]   I'm sure by now you found out what sorghum is.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.780]   Yes, I actually, I knew what sorghum was, but when I gave the talk just for dramatic
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.260]   a lot, I feigned in ignorance of what sorghum was.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.500]   It's some kind of grain.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.140]   I went out and found out after you that.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.140]   Yeah, I actually.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.140]   What is sorghum?
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.620]   I looked it up before I gave the talk.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.180]   I didn't know what sorghum was.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.660]   It's just one of those things you see.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:27.660]   And now I see it everywhere.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.660]   It's one of those things.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.660]   Now you see it.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.020]   I see it in whole food all the time.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.020]   Sorghum.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.620]   And there's, it's in Captain Crunch and Stella.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.620]   It's like a sorghum.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.620]   Oh, great.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.620]   You know, sweet.
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.620]   I don't know.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:38.620]   Sorghum.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.620]   What?
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.620]   Sorghum.
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:42.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   Rob Reed sorghum expert.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   You know what?
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.580]   I'd be my little tagline under my name.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.340]   We're going to go to do an ad for Shutterstock right now.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.020]   I think we should search for sorghum on Shutterstock.
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.020]   It's S.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.020]   Right idea.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.580]   O-R-G-H-U-M, right?
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.420]   I believe you're right.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.500]   Shutterstock is the place.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:04.060]   I was, you know, when we went to see the most recent hot film Guardians of the Galaxy,
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.740]   I'm watching the credits, Shutterstock.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:14.500]   In the credits, everybody uses stock video, photos, illustrations, vectors from Shutterstock.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.620]   There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.900]   If you were going to write an article about sorghum, you'd be wanting to go to Shutterstock.com.
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.500]   Life magazine could do an article about sorghum.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   Gorgeous.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.500]   All that imagery.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.500]   Gorgeous.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.300]   All about sorghum.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.900]   From seed to table.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.260]   It's all there.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.220]   Many of the contributors to Shutterstock are professional photographers you could tell.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.940]   I mean, this is no amateur sorghum shot.
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:40.940]   No.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.700]   Now, what are the great things about this search?
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.340]   First of all, they have a huge selection.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.860]   They have kind of almost, you know, I mean, what is the number now?
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:55.620]   Every time we go there, I want to see 40 million, 40 million royalty-free stock images.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.180]   They added 261,000 last week.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.540]   Many of them are of sorghum.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.540]   Yep.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.540]   Many are.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.460]   And many of them are not selfies.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:08.060]   And this, of course, with 40 million images, the search, let's see if there's a, let's see
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.060]   a selfies.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.260]   Yeah, there's a lot of selfies.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.260]   Selfies.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.740]   Now, here's the beauty part.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.660]   You might want a happy selfie.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.060]   You might want a sad selfie.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.900]   There are no sorghum selfies, though.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.900]   That's the, that's a good news.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.900]   Go to Shutterstock.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:22.900]   He stumps.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.220]   Oh, there's a happy selfie.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.220]   Those girls are taking happy selfies.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.220]   What about sad selfie?
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.420]   You got a sad selfie?
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.820]   I love it that the search allows you to add adjectives.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.220]   Oh, that dog, that is a sad selfie.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.300]   That is so sad.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.260]   You imagine that you could put a sad dog selfie and Shutterstock would have had it out.
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.260]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.260]   I love that.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.260]   It would have had a sad dog selfie.
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.700]   And there's times you're writing a blog post, you're writing an article, you need a sad
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.900]   dog selfie.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.900]   Where else?
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.300]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   With so many images, there's sure to be something just right for you.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.140]   You do not have to have a paid account to create an account.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.620]   In fact, you don't even need a credit card to create an account at Shutterstock.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:01.780]   I would do that.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.780]   That'll give you access.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:04.340]   Oh, look drones.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.060]   How about selfie, drone selfies?
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.100]   How about sad drone selfies?
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.100]   Let's not do it.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.100]   Drones.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.100]   Drones.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.100]   Drones.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.100]   Those are drone selfies.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.100]   It's the new word.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.580]   Those aren't drone selfies, though.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:18.580]   That one is.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.580]   All right.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.020]   Yeah, he's taking a selfie with a drone.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.180]   Amazing.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.420]   The search tools are great.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.860]   You can not only narrow it down by emotion, subject, color even.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.860]   They have a color wheel.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.060]   You could say, "It has to be in my color palette.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.420]   It has to be blue."
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.420]   You could say file type.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.420]   You can even narrow it down by gender.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.940]   How many people are in the images?
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.260]   They've got a great iPad app.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.260]   What a webby award.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.540]   It's beautiful.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:48.420]   If you, they're multi-lingual customer service, more than a dozen countries, full-time customer
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.460]   support throughout the week.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:55.180]   If you need stock video, stock photos, stock illustrations, you've got to use Shutterstock.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.300]   Like I said, you can make the free account, create the light boxes, share it, store it
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.220]   for later use for inspiration.
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.620]   Just go to Shutterstock.com.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.620]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.020]   Just start an account.
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.860]   Begin using Shutterstock to imagine what your next project could be like.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.620]   Save your favorite images to review later.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:15.580]   Once you decide to purchase, they have individual image packs or monthly subscriptions.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.140]   We got the monthly subscription to it.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.140]   I love it.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.300]   So, there's more dog selfies.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.540]   There's quite a few.
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.260]   There's some good cat selfies too.
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.660]   Oh, cats don't do selfies, do they?
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:28.060]   Look, go to Shutterstock right here.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.380]   I got a cat doing a selfie right here.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:33.900]   If you decide to buy a Shutterstock, even if you want to get the subscription, use "Twit
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.900]   814" and you'll get 20% off any image file.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:44.780]   If you use "Twit 814" as the offer code, and we do thank Shutterstock so much for giving
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.860]   us some joy in life and sponsoring the Twitch show.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:53.380]   September 9th, we believe the day for Apple's iPhone announcement.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.380]   Indeed.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:57.020]   What we don't know is how soon the iPhone will be available.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:02.660]   Typically, it's 10 days, the week following Friday.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.660]   How would you say that?
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:08.580]   It's on a Tuesday the 9th, then a week from that Friday, the phone will be available.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:13.460]   The first Friday after the first Thursday.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.460]   Thank you.
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.460]   The first Friday after the second Thursday.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.460]   Yes.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.460]   First Friday after the second Thursday.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.860]   Please, if you're going to confuse us, do it with correct confusion.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.260]   I bet in German there's one word that means that.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.260]   It's one word.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.860]   There's one very long word.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.740]   Just quite fazacken, chutivore, but yes, exactly.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:38.580]   Now here's an interesting little tidbit from John Gruber, the master of snark, but also
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.740]   Apple's pretty much pet blogger.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:46.700]   I mean, he gets all the scoops that Apple really loves Gruber.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:52.380]   He implies that Apple's going to announce their wrist wearable thing next month.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:55.980]   He's talking about an article from The Verge on how you'll charge a Moto 360.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:00.780]   Apparently, Motorola has announced that their smart watch will use Qi charging, wireless
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.220]   charging, right on.
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.220]   Great.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:06.300]   All the watches I've used, including the Pebble, you have a kind of proprietary dock, you have
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.260]   to snap it into.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:12.620]   This is the Android Wear watches have the same thing.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:18.060]   But Motorola is going to do a round one and they're going to built in Qi charging.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.220]   Here's what Gruber says.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:24.540]   It looks like Motorola's designers try to draw as much attention as they could to the
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:29.340]   360's stupid flat tire display shape.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:34.540]   The only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn't even ship until after Apple
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.580]   announces their wrist wearable thing next month.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.820]   Knowing John, he's slipping in a little bit of a tidbit there.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.460]   It's even worse than that.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:49.220]   I'm pretty sure he wrote this and I don't know him.
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:55.820]   It looks like he wrote this article only to sort of back-handedly slip into it that very
[00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:01.020]   important piece of information, which actually everyone is picking up on, obviously.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:05.740]   But there's something a little bit, I don't know.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.740]   It looks like he's pushing it too much.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:13.060]   It's like, "All right, if you have that piece of information, at least we understand this
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:18.500]   is no big deal for you because you have all of these leaks all the time and all of the
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:24.020]   information, but at least write a couple of sentences on that topic."
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.020]   I don't know.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.780]   Well, now it gets worse.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.700]   Because after I agree with you, I think that's the thing you do.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.740]   When you went to Yale University, you say, "Oh yeah, I went to a small college in New
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.740]   Haven."
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740]   Exactly.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740]   It's a snobbery, right?
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.100]   And then people find out they go, "Oh wow."
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.020]   He knew, but it wasn't a big deal for him.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.620]   That's how big a deal he is.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:49.620]   Then he makes it worse because he now tweets, "Oh, by the way, I have no idea whether Apple
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.100]   is planning a wrist thing for September or October.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.620]   I was just making a joke."
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.420]   He really didn't come off like a punchline now, did it?
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.420]   No.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.420]   Maybe it's just a...
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.820]   He's better at blogging than at tech humor.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   Maybe.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820]   Well, he's definitely a good blog.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.020]   I mean, he knows how to drive traffic.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.140]   How many hits do you think that piece got, right?
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.660]   Well, yeah, for sure.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.500]   And I read his blog all the time.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500]   He's one of my favorite bloggers.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   Oh, I do.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500]   I love him.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   He's a brilliant blogger.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:26.420]   And he tweeted this also.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.820]   Apple will reveal its wrist gadget next month says Apple Watch Your John Gruber, then
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:35.780]   accidentally they had a picture of Reagan's press secretary Brady who passed it.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.420]   They passed away this week.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.420]   Very confusing.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.420]   It's funny.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.900]   Very confusing.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.260]   I would be very surprised if they announced their watch.
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:50.980]   I mean, it's pretty much established now that they're gearing up to announce the phones,
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:51.980]   right?
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:58.940]   And Apple traditionally does not announce a new product and launch another major product
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.780]   at the same time.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:05.140]   That's why I think he was actually trying to make a joke.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:09.340]   It would surprise me that they would announce both at the same time.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.100]   So I'm wondering if they're ever going to announce it.
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.700]   I feel like, I don't know.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.580]   I mean, Apple's never said they're making a watch.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.580]   That's true.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.060]   It's all of us who have said making a watch.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:24.300]   Well they've hired a lot of people who know how to make watches.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:30.460]   That would be a very strange string of hires if they weren't at least exploring that kind,
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.820]   that type of product.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.540]   They probably are exploring it.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.300]   Aren't they?
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.500]   But every time I use one of these watches, this is the Android Wear, which is the best
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.580]   of the breed at this point.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.580]   It's nice.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:45.100]   It's not something you run to the store to get.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.740]   But that's why everyone's waiting for Apple to do something, right?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:52.660]   Because a lot of people say, "Oh, come on, stop it with Apple.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:57.940]   You're always pointing to them and waiting for them to do something when we already have
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   watches."
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:04.540]   It's exactly the issue we had with quote unquote smartphones before they came up with the iPhone
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:08.180]   and with tablets before the iPad and a bunch of things.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.740]   So that's really the promise that Apple is going to make a product that is going to fulfill
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.940]   a function we didn't really know we wanted.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.940]   That was still dark.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.300]   Because old, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.580]   I mean, yeah, that's the thing.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.980]   We've seen a lot of those watches and none of them are really compelling.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:30.180]   So the big question mark is we've seen from Google, from a bunch of people, and none of
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.180]   them are compelling.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:37.300]   So will Apple be able to make that into a useful new product category and make it into
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.300]   a massive consumer hit?
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.340]   Is it possible all the people they hired really are just for making this in the iPhone?
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.060]   I mean, they hired a bunch of health people who could just be part of HealthKit, part
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.940]   of the iPhone's own health capabilities.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.180]   The designers, all of that.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.340]   Couldn't they just be a better iPhone?
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.980]   You can get a lot more from the health standpoint, though.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:00.660]   I think basis was the first to put a green laser into the phone that actually gets heart
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.660]   rate.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.140]   Really, I'm sorry to the watch.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.900]   Yeah, but even that, you can't be exercising when you're doing it.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.900]   It's imperfect.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.180]   It's 1.0 or 0.9.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.340]   But I bought a basis watch for a while.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.340]   It didn't rock my world either.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.780]   I ordered for about three weeks.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.860]   But I think that let's think of that as 0.9.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:22.500]   My guess is if you're going to be really, really serious about quantified self, you do
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.180]   need to be on the body.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.180]   Yeah, and probably preferably on the rest.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.020]   I'm going to nipple ring or something.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.860]   Or maybe like something behind your ear.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:33.700]   Wouldn't there be better places you could put this for getting for pulse?
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.540]   I mean, really the best place for pulse monitors on your chest.
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.900]   For a very high fidelity one, yeah.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.900]   Got any question?
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.900]   That's right.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.980]   That's where the heart is.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.980]   I'm curious.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.540]   I wonder if we'll even see anything from Apple this year.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.780]   I bet not.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:54.140]   I'm going to do a reverse Gruber and say, "We're not going to see anything in 2014 at all."
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:05:02.540]   I also feel like Apple may not have the magic formula.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:08.100]   Yeah, there have been much a lot of very serious efforts by serious folks to make a
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.420]   watch that is fabulous.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420]   And there's not even--
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.260]   But then again, Apple did it with the iPod.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.260]   Apple did it with the iPod.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.260]   Certainly the Apple did it with the iPad.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.260]   They've done it three times.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.060]   That's the really exciting thing.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.060]   And that's why we're so focused on what they're going to do in that space.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:30.020]   It's that now we know, you know, they've done it three times, maybe even more if you
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.700]   count other things.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.420]   They've done it three times, which sort of all wondering, are they going to be able
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.420]   to make it again?
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:43.980]   And even more importantly, they have done it in ways that we didn't really think where
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.740]   we didn't imagine it was going to happen like that.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.980]   So the big question is, are they going to come out of left field and do something that
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.380]   we didn't really imagine?
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.060]   And that's why we can't really get excited, right?
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.060]   That's what you're saying, Leo.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:03.620]   But both of you, we're not really excited about whatever they have in store.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.820]   It requires a leap of faith in Apple.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.820]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.660]   And we've been waiting for them to do something really agenda setting in television for a
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.660]   very long time.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   Same thing.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660]   And it just--
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.660]   I like this.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.660]   It has not been a year in that case.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.540]   HP might have stolen their thunder.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.420]   One of the things I thought Apple was going to do was make a stylish watch, like make
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   it jewelry.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.260]   That's beautiful that you want to wear.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.500]   Because in almost every case right now, I like my good watch is better than I like.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.620]   And Jeff said that.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.660]   He likes his-- he has a--
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   Doesn't matter.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:36.660]   What?
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.980]   Doesn't matter?
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:43.900]   You don't want the world to know that you're wearing a Cartier tank watch.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.980]   He has a Cartier watch that he says is better than any smart watch because it's a beautiful
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.980]   work of art.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   It's a piece of jewelry.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.700]   And I would say I have a tank watch also and a number of other very nice watches, which
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.500]   I wear on special occasions.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.100]   But the HP watch, HP watch, look.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.940]   Very pretty sure view.
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:03.140]   I think that's a steak sauce.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:10.540]   The HP watch, which will be on guilt.com this fall, is designed by Michael Bestia.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.100]   Is he French, Patrick?
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.100]   Michael Bestia, I have never heard of him.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.100]   Me neither.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.700]   Everybody's saying, oh, it's by designer Michael Bestia.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.500]   Oh, the Michael Bestia.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.500]   Yes.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:27.820]   For all I know, he's some guy and works in the American fashion designer known for his
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:28.820]   American label.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.780]   Isn't that a oxymoron in American fashion design?
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.620]   Hell, anyway.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.980]   The watch looks nice.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.060]   He's the one that HP chose.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.220]   So that tells you something.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.020]   He's selling it on guilt only, which is odd.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:50.740]   Is that one thing that HP definitely didn't do with this announcement is steal Apple's
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:51.740]   thunder.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.740]   Yes, you were asking that.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.540]   Yes, not.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:01.420]   Speaking of Apple thunder, well, let's take a break and I want to talk about the persistent
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.260]   rumor that Apple's going to abandon Intel.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.380]   That'd be a big blow for Intel, wouldn't it?
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   That'd be big.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.380]   But I think Apple, you got to think Apple's suffering some pain right now.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:17.740]   They've been waiting for Intel to come out with its successor to Haswell, the 14 nanometer
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.740]   broadwell chip.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.540]   And it's much delayed and Apple's been kind of stuck.
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.020]   They can't release a new Mac.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:30.060]   Or at least not update the new Mac significantly until Intel gets off the stick and the delay
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.340]   has been a while now.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.340]   So we'll talk about that.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.380]   Is it armed for the next Macintosh?
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.540]   Just a word from a carbonite, it's online backup time.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:45.180]   I know people who every time they watch Twit, this is their backup time, right?
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.260]   I'm going to be listening to Twit and I'll be backing up.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:53.060]   Now, that's fine as long as you don't forget and as long as your hard drive doesn't crash
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.180]   the day before Twit and you lose six days worth of data, the best backup would just
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:59.100]   be you wouldn't have to think about it, right?
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.260]   It would just happen.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.260]   Be automatic.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.500]   And more than that, it wouldn't just be on Sundays.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.220]   It would be continuous whenever you're online.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:11.620]   And best of all, it would be off-site because as we all know, having backups sitting next
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.820]   to the computer is a recipe for disaster.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.260]   If there's a fire, a flooded tornado, somebody breaks in and steals your stuff.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.260]   I love carbonite.
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.220]   Now, maybe not the only thing you do.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.620]   You can have a local backup.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:25.820]   That carbonite now makes a hardware appliance for business that does both local and cloud
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.940]   backup, best of both worlds.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.380]   And that's great because as we know, in business, high availability is important.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.500]   Getting back in business is important.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.660]   Carbonite is great for business.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.660]   It's great for home.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.500]   It is a great way to save because your data, because you don't have to think about it.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:45.540]   And it's very affordable, $59.99 a year to backup everything on a Mac or a PC.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.340]   They have plans for external drives, network attached storage, small business.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.820]   And all of it, automatic, continuous off-site, the things you need.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:54.820]   Now, it's free to try.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.300]   And I want you to do so by going to carbonite.com.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.860]   And all I ask is when they say, "Where did you hear it?
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.260]   What's the offer code use Twit?"
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.060]   That way they'll know you heard about it on Twit.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.060]   And you'll get two months free if you decide to buy.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.980]   They've got plans for every user, for every situation.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.340]   But all of it is the best automatic backup.
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.900]   You pay once a year.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.300]   You pay for it and you forget it.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.460]   That's what I love about it.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.940]   Carbonite.com.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.940]   Try it today.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.140]   Please use the offer code Twit.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:29.060]   Actually, David Friend, the guy who founded Carbonite reminds me a lot of you, Rob.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.620]   He's a serial entrepreneur.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.060]   He started ARP, the synthesizer company.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.140]   Yeah, out of MIT.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.740]   He was a lot of people who got through starting synthesizers.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:39.740]   Ray Kurzweil.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.740]   Ray Kurzweil, same thing.
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:41.740]   Steve Gibson.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.740]   Right.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:48.860]   So, he retired, kind of a successful entrepreneur and was enjoying life.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.220]   Then his daughter in college calls him and says, "Daddy, I lost my thesis.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220]   Can you help me?"
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.540]   And he said, "I don't know."
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.540]   Carbonite.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.540]   And he invented carbonite as a solution.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.180]   He invented carbonite, which is kind of cool.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.180]   Very nice guy.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.740]   You would like him.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.740]   Really?
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.540]   I'm from the college in Hillel College in New York.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.700]   He went to a small liberal arts college in New York.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.340]   Which my brother-in-law says, "The best college in Connecticut."
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:17.100]   You're brother-in-law got a Harvard or something.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.500]   He went to Harvard.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   John Luegasse.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.380]   And that's French name because he's a French man.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:30.500]   He was president of Apple Internationals like 30 years ago.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.740]   John brought Tucuprottino to help run Apple in the Gilomillo days.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:39.700]   He's actually made a pretty good name for himself as a blogger.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:46.900]   The Monday note, every Monday comes out with analysis of the business scene.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.700]   He wrote an article this Monday called "Mac and Tell.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.340]   The end is nigh."
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:58.660]   He's actually quoting a 16-year-old blogger, Matt Richmond, who wrote a blog in 2011 saying,
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:02.220]   "Apple and arms sitting in a tree."
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:06.020]   Matt said, "I don't know exactly when Besunar later Macs will run on Apple-designed arm chips."
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:09.420]   Now, as time goes by, this becomes more and more compelling.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:14.100]   Apple has announced a desktop-grade chip for its latest iPhone, the A7, right?
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.620]   They made a big point of it being 64-bit.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.020]   Intel's way behind on Broadwell.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:25.260]   Apple would love to get a Broadwell processor in its Macs, but they have to wait.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.820]   Even though Apple is one of their biggest customers and usually gets the chips before
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.740]   anybody else, they're still waiting.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.340]   Even strong rumors have been going on for a long time that there's a skunkworks at Apple
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.660]   that's porting OS10 to arm.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:47.340]   I'm sure that OS10 and arm is up and running somewhere at one infinite loop.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.340]   Does this make sense?
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.780]   Is it something I imagine to be bad news for Intel?
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.780]   I'd be terrible in there.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:56.780]   I think that the reason to do it would probably be margins and control.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:01.380]   They certainly hate for somebody else's slipping product to slip their own product, and that
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.460]   looks like it's going to happen with the new Macs in this holiday season.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.140]   The reason not to do it is probably software compatibility and performance.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:15.020]   Intel just is an extraordinarily powerful engine.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:19.380]   When you think about way back when they first announced transitioning over to Intel, it
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:22.340]   had a huge positive impact on the market share.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.780]   I was so negative about that.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.180]   I was bitter and angry.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.700]   As it turned out, they managed it perfectly.
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.700]   They did it beautifully.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.740]   Couldn't have been done better.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.100]   I wouldn't be surprised if they had a dual strategy for a period of time, and maybe the
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:37.020]   more expensive systems were running on Intel and offered greater software compatibility.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:42.700]   Imagine a MacBook Air, their lightest, smallest computer running on arm, 20 hours battery
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.740]   life because one of the big things arm brings you as a great battery life.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:53.460]   Steve Jobs, he quotes Steve Jobs in the articles, and Steve's well known for saying, "I've always
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.140]   wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything."
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.140]   Everything.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.140]   Everything in the stack.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:04.260]   If you want to make great software, you've got to make the hardware and vice versa.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:08.700]   That's completely true, but Steve Jobs is like statistics.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.300]   You can make him say anything.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   It's true.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.300]   Like Moses.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:17.300]   Yeah, you pick the right quote and the right context.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.980]   I wouldn't put too much stock in that.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.380]   But I do think that it's fair to say that Apple has always moved in that direction to
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.380]   manufacture it.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.460]   That's always been their competitive advantage.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:33.420]   I'm certain that they are at least exploring the possibility again of running Mac OS on
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:39.180]   arm chips as they were when they had the power PCs and they were, they had the blue box
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.140]   and the yellow box.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:46.700]   They were running Mac OS on Intel for a long time, or at least it was rumored, but it
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:52.620]   turned out it was probably true, for a long time before actually debuting that transition.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:58.500]   I think the problem here is they've done that transition a few years ago, maybe 10 years
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.340]   ago.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:03.780]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:11.540]   In order for that transition to become relevant, you need to have a much heavier weight on that
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.700]   delay from Haswell to Broadwell.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.540]   It can't, a few months of delay is not going to provoke that.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:23.300]   Remember, they stuck with power PCs for a very long time, I mean two or three years,
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.020]   when they were way, way, way behind the Intel chips.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:34.620]   And they were doing ridiculous things like putting multiple CPUs on a motherboard in order
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:40.700]   to try and get enough to suck enough power out of the power PCs that couldn't keep up
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.260]   with Intel.
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:47.820]   And that would also be an issue, sure, you would have a lot more battery life, but the
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:55.420]   A7, the iPhone chip is really powerful for a phone.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.420]   For a mobile chip.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.460]   It's, yeah, exactly, for a mobile chip.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:07.620]   It's nothing like what an Intel desktop chip can do or even notebook class.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.420]   So is that true?
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.500]   I mean, is that really true?
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.220]   Is it the case that ARM isn't...
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.220]   It's just not...
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:21.580]   Well, you're running, I mean, okay, I'm not an expert on this, but it seems to be pretty
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.380]   obvious, you know, on a phone or tablet, you're running one, maybe two things at the same
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.380]   time.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:32.940]   And yes, if you have the right game, you'll feature graphics that are pretty darn impressive,
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:41.580]   but it's an actual desktop level or notebook level OS has a lot more happening in the background
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.580]   and in the foreground.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.020]   I know you work for Blizzard and you don't speak for Blizzard, but look at the Nvidia
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.780]   Shield, their new tablet, which just came out running on what is it, the Tegra 1, the
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.980]   latest Tegra.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:51.980]   That is a very...
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.500]   That is a fast little puppy.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.500]   Gaming is great on it.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.100]   It's a gaming platform.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.100]   Cheers.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.700]   No, it is.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.580]   I'm not sure that you can make that jump.
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.260]   I'm not saying it's impossible or it's never going to happen.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:14.460]   I'm just not sure, you know, six months delay in a Broadwell chip is going to be such a
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:24.500]   huge burden that you would think we have to overhaul our entire system and, you know,
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:33.540]   system and developer infrastructure, not infrastructure, but ecosystem just for that.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:37.380]   It's an enormous undertaking and I don't think they would just do it.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.380]   That's a good point.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.100]   Although, I mean, talking about owning the stack, they've even got their own programming
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.100]   language.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:48.460]   Objective-C could kind of is de facto apples and Swift is all apples.
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:55.900]   Well, if they wanted to have to own their own chips, couldn't they build Intel clones?
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.540]   Like AMD does?
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.540]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:01.660]   I think, you know, the irony is Apple started ARM.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.900]   Yeah, partnership with Acorn, right?
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.900]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.900]   I mean, they used to own ARM.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.860]   They sold their stake in it years ago.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:14.660]   I think this is kind of sexy and I like what you said, which is make the low-ends arm.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.660]   Perhaps.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.260]   The power computers, the pro-computers could be Intel.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:24.060]   Yeah, because the Intel chips, at least for the foreseeable future, I agree with Patrick,
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.460]   are much, much beefier.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:29.660]   But look at a Chromebook, which is some of the Chromebooks are ARM, aren't they?
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:30.660]   I think so, yeah.
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.460]   They're not all cellarons.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.460]   They're ARM.
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.860]   I think people don't need the power that they used to.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:42.700]   In fact, we had a great discussion a week ago with Jeff Jarvis on Twig and which he said,
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:48.380]   "My Max died and you need to tell me why I should buy another computer or just not."
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.300]   He says, "My inclination is not to buy another computer.
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.780]   Just go with Chromebooks and tablets and phones."
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:57.300]   I think that increasingly, for 99% of people, they don't need a computer.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.980]   Yeah, when the iPad first came out, my feeling was if this becomes a rich man's Kindle,
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.340]   it's doomed, which is how a lot of people were writing out.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.340]   Right.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.340]   That's what we thought it was.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.380]   A lot of it becomes a poor man's laptop.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.540]   It's called "Wastel category."
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.540]   Right.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.780]   The games have moved that way.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:18.740]   If you had an ARM-based air that had great battery life, it was less expensive.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.740]   It could easily be fast enough for everything but the most high-end.
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.500]   You work with gamers, Patrick.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.660]   Gamers want more power, obviously.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:30.100]   Yeah, obviously, but that's a limited subset of the population.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.100]   It's tiny, yeah.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.700]   Just like professional video editors.
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.700]   Yeah, sure.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:39.580]   I mean, it's not tiny, but it's certainly not the general populace.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:46.540]   I'm just not sure that an ARM chip at the moment can run Mac OS.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.540]   And maybe it can.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.540]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.180]   Maybe it's two years away.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.100]   It just doesn't seem like we're quite there.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:57.380]   We might be not so far from now.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.020]   There is one big company that's running both Intel and ARM.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:05.420]   It's called Microsoft, and Windows Pro runs on Intel, and Windows RT runs on ARM.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.940]   Admittedly, it's kind of ugly when it comes to running apps because it's not the same
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.700]   app store for both.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:16.020]   You know, what runs on RT runs on RT and only RT.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:20.820]   In fact, I think Microsoft's probably killing RT and you're going to replace it with Windows
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.180]   phone on those smaller devices.
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.500]   I think it's possible.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:30.060]   By the way, we talked last week and I think it was confirmed about the Google case where
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:35.380]   they caught a child pornographer by scanning his email and it has been confirmed as one
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.420]   we surmised that they did that using hashes provided by the National Center for Missing
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.020]   and Exploited Children, not by looking at email directly.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:50.420]   And we at the time speculated that perhaps and seemed likely that other email providers
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.980]   like Yahoo and Microsoft might be doing the same.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.980]   Guess what?
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:57.740]   Microsoft tip ends in a rest of alleged child porn hustler.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:59.300]   Yes, the same thing.
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.700]   He was using Hotmail to distribute child pornography.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:08.620]   In this article by CNET by Derek Kerr, she says, "Google, Facebook and Twitter, as well
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:12.700]   as Microsoft, all use something called photo DNA.
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.100]   It's the same technology.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:18.500]   The hashes are provided by the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:24.060]   And then these companies scan through the images, all images looking for matches and
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.940]   if they find a match, they report it to the NCMC, MEC."
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.540]   So yes, Microsoft does the same thing.
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.540]   Everybody does.
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.540]   So don't worry.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:54.700]   Dis
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:22:24.660]   a
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:31.660]   special
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:38.660]   that
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:45.660]   is
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:52.660]   the
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:59.660]   irony
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:22:59.660]   of
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:07.660]   this.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:14.660]   I
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:21.660]   really
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:45.660]   love
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:52.660]   it.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:59.660]   I
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:06.660]   have
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:13.660]   a
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:20.660]   lot of
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:27.660]   things.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:34.660]   I
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:41.660]   have
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:41.660]   a
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:48.660]   lot of
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:55.660]   things.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:25:02.660]   I
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:09.660]   have
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:09.660]   a
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:16.660]   lot of
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:23.660]   things.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:23.660]   I
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:30.660]   have
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:30.660]   a
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:30.660]   lot of
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:31.660]   things.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:38.660]   I have a lot of things.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:45.660]   I have a lot of things.
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:52.660]   I have a lot of things.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:57.660]   I think they are only product anymore.
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:02.660]   They are focusing on software as a service.
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:03.660]   Exactly.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.660]   So it would be a great sense to have everyone.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:13.660]   When XP cannot service a lot of their cloud products, it's just not going to integrate with it.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.660]   It's astounding.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.660]   25% of
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.660]   market share.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:23.660]   You can't deny that
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.660]   it's a
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:27.660]   flop.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:32.660]   What I feel is that I love windows 8 and I am the only one who is not going to get windows 9 for free if that's true.
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.660]   You like it.
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   You get to pay for the next one.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:43.660]   Microsoft has a new app called snippet that lets you track celebrities.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.660]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:45.660]   Nothing.
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:48.660]   Is it called snippet or stock yet?
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.660]   Snip it with a 3 instead of an e.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.660]   Very
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:54.660]   leat of Microsoft.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:55.660]   Why Microsoft?
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.660]   By the way, it's iPhone only.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:02.660]   iPhone and Windows XP only.
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.660]   It's the strangest.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:12.660]   Every celebrity has a profile page created by Microsoft which includes a timeline of news and imagery from around the web.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:16.660]   Alongside options to like and comment on each page of content.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.660]   It's never been easier to stock your favorite celebrity.
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.660]   That's fabulous.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:21.660]   Never been easier.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.660]   I think it makes sense.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:26.660]   It's easy to make fun of.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:30.660]   And certainly I have done that as well.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:34.660]   But it does, you know, it's the Yahoo strategy, right?
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:35.660]   Try to get.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.660]   Yeah, hold on.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:38.660]   That works so well for Yahoo.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:39.660]   All right.
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:40.660]   Fair enough.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.660]   Fair enough.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.660]   It's been a great move.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.660]   It's really the MySpace strategy.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.660]   They do have a lot of stuff.
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:48.660]   No, this is, you know what?
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:52.660]   This is being, this is what Microsoft's been doing with being.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:55.660]   They've been creating content silos for Bing.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:56.660]   They've hired editorial staff.
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:00.660]   Bing News actually has a bigger newsroom than a lot of newspapers now.
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.660]   So I know I agree with you.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.660]   This is not a bad strategy.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:07.660]   It does remind one a little bit of the Yahoo strategy to go content.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.660]   Focus.
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:09.660]   Exactly.
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:10.660]   Which didn't work.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.660]   And to go broad content.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.660]   I mean, celebrities appeal to everyone.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.660]   And stalking celebrities appeal to, well, everybody else.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.660]   Who doesn't love stalking celebrities.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:21.660]   Who hasn't done it?
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.660]   I wish I had an iPhone so I could download this.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:27.660]   I need my Katy Perry fix.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:28.660]   We're going to take a break.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:29.660]   Come back with more.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:30.660]   Rob Reed is here.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:31.660]   Patrick Bejah.
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:32.660]   Great to have you both.
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.660]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:35.660]   Great studio audience.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.660]   Thanks.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.660]   See, August is tough.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.780]   Because everybody's on vacation, which means we have a massive studio audience for every
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.780]   show.
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.780]   And nothing is happening.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.780]   And no hosts.
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:46.780]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.780]   And there's no news.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.780]   So you came.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.220]   It's glad you're here.
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:55.020]   Paul and Mary Jo and Devorah can everybody, they're going to watch somebody else's show.
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.020]   They're on vacation.
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:00.020]   I can show if they brought you by a great company that I'm a big fan of.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.660]   Citrix, you know I talk about them all the time and go to meeting, which we use all the
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.660]   time.
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:10.380]   So the job of meeting is the number one way to meet when you're not all in the same place.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:15.660]   And frankly, I go home so they don't have to be in the same place and have go to meeting
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.660]   meetings.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.420]   Nowadays, the office is distributed.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420]   Everybody's everywhere.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.420]   They're all over the world.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.420]   They're all over the country.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.020]   Meeting with your coworkers isn't a question of where.
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.820]   It's a question of how?
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.900]   Same thing with your clients.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:31.420]   You want to pitch somebody with a PowerPoint.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.980]   You're going to fly across the country.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.620]   No, you're going to use go to meeting.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:38.260]   It gives you eye contact because the HD face is built into go to meeting.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:41.580]   It gives you great video so you can see them.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:45.260]   Plus you get screen sharing so you can share that presentation with them.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:49.460]   34 million meetings last meeting, last year on go to meeting.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:52.140]   And I did about half of them, I feel like sometimes.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:57.140]   Go to meeting lets you meet with anyone anywhere from any computer, tablet or smartphone.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.380]   You can present from an iPad.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:29:59.380]   It's great on an iPad.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:03.420]   You can go sit in the backyard, plug in your headphones and you don't, that's it.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.940]   You don't need a phone, you just need an internet.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.500]   Talk face to face, share screen, schedule meetings in advance so it's as easy as a click
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.660]   of the mouse.
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:11.660]   Go to meeting.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.660]   I love it.

[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.780]   I have a snippet.
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.140]   How to follow me.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:39.740]   Oh my God, there's a biography that's straight out of Wikipedia.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:40.740]   Net worth.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.740]   Wow, I'm rich.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.700]   TV shows related celebrity Sarah Lane's on here.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:50.540]   Amber MacArthur's on here, Patrick Norton's on here.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:51.540]   Thank you, Microsoft.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:55.220]   I won't mock your celebrity stalking application ever again.
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.940]   Maybe that's their plan.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.860]   Does it give you your current location?
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:30:59.860]   That would be creepy.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:01.860]   Well, you know what?
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.140]   It would if I checked in with four square.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:09.380]   It will until after between eight in the morning and right, but I turned off notifications
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.660]   until eight tomorrow morning.
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:13.180]   We don't know where Leo sleeps yet yet.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:20.300]   I'm not going to do the hotel finding brides $500 for bad reviews.
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.300]   It's hysterical.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.820]   That was one of the funniest articles.
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:27.740]   And I don't know how the hotel now says that I was just a joke.
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:30.380]   They took that down and then of course nothing dies on the web.
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:35.060]   If you go to archive.org, you can see it on the way back machine.
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:39.020]   The idea was when you, this is a beautiful, I know it.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.020]   It's in Hudson, New York.
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.020]   The Union Street guest has very cute, but it's a little quaint, little funky.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:49.020]   And their fear is that people would come check in as part of a bridal party and say,
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:53.020]   "Well, there was no gym and right bad reviews."
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:58.100]   So they say on their website, "Please understand this is an old house.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.140]   It's a classic place.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:06.060]   And if you've booked the info at a wedding or a big group, you've got to give us a deposit.
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:11.420]   And we will deduct $500 from that deposit for every negative review placed on any internet
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.260]   site by anyone in your party."
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.260]   Boom.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.260]   Put down the hammer.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.900]   Now, everybody made fun and laughed and said, "That's terrible."
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:18.900]   But you know what?
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.740]   I kind of understand there's a war going on right now.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:24.020]   I've seen articles about chefs and Yelp.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.260]   I've seen articles.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:30.180]   But what this is is don't troll us or we're going to find you.
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.860]   Well, this is different from trolling us.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:34.660]   We have a paying guest saying, "I wasn't happy there."
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.660]   And then a bride getting whacked for $500.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:38.660]   And by the way, you mentioned-
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:39.660]   They're not going to do it.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:40.660]   No one was fined.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.660]   But they say it was a joke.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:45.860]   They've definitely gotten the Amy's Baking Company treatment on Yelp because I'm looking
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:52.460]   at it right now and there's scads of one star reviews posted in the last three days.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.980]   Oh, just because of that.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:56.300]   We never stayed there, but boy, these guys are terrible.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.300]   Yeah, well, it's funny.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.340]   Like, a lot of these people are claiming because I think they're trying to get around
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.460]   Yelp taking their review down.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:06.500]   They must have a full house last night because like, "We were here yesterday for a wedding
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.500]   party.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.500]   Terrible service."
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.500]   Even was, "Oh, come on.
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.500]   You were not."
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:13.580]   It's like dozens of people claim to be there last night.
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:19.660]   Here's one that says, "I've never been a guest, so I can't speak to the decor, the customer
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.660]   service.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:24.740]   I've been out of time in that town and I have walked past that hotel at least a dozen times
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.060]   and I never even noticed it.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.380]   To me, that's damning.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.180]   It's not architecturally interesting."
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.180]   I have seen bombed out...
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:33.180]   That's a troll.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:34.180]   Here's one.
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.660]   I have seen bombed out shelters in Iraq that were more appropriate for guests than this
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.660]   place.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:42.180]   Obviously, if I'm a member of the US military, there's also been a difference.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.180]   Sure.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.180]   Sure.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.180]   Let's put it this way.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:49.260]   If Saddam Hussein had a choice between his spider hole and USGH, he would have stayed
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:52.340]   in the spider hole.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:58.100]   I don't think that this was just some little old lady who thought it was a good idea and
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.460]   changed her mind when she found out that it wasn't.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.460]   This is damning.
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:05.460]   We walked into this hotel once and ended up leaving.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.060]   It felt somewhat unweltered.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.460]   It was spooky.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.460]   Anyway.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   But I do think...
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:14.060]   So can they now submit requests for the right to be forgotten?
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.740]   There is a larger issue here, which is...
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:21.300]   And you imagine, you're a chef, you have a restaurant, you have a hotel.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.300]   You do your best.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.300]   You work hard.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.300]   You think you have a pretty good product.
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:27.300]   And there are just cranky people in the world.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:33.460]   And those cranky people are writing me nasty reviews and it can kill your business.
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:34.460]   What do you...
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:40.740]   I understand a little bit from the other side the feeling that we've lost control of our
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.740]   image.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.540]   Well, particularly if it's somebody who has not actually used the product.
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:47.340]   And that's where I think it gets preposterous.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.380]   And in this case, they were basically waving the red cape at the internet.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.380]   So they could be...
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:54.380]   Oh, huge sound.
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.380]   You've never...
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.380]   Never wave the red cape.
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:00.980]   But yeah, it doesn't give me any value as a potential buyer of a product when I see
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:05.420]   something says, "Well, I never ate here or I never stayed here or I never read this book."
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.140]   But it shouldn't...
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:10.980]   There should be a policy on a site like Yelp or Amazon or whatever else that if somebody
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:14.940]   is essentially clearly not used the product, you just take that review down.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.940]   That's just silly.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:16.940]   That helped me.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940]   I don't go after...
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940]   I understand.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940]   I'm not saying what they did was right.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:22.940]   Kookie was dumb and obviously it's backfired.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.940]   Incredible.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:28.380]   However, I also can understand the other side of it where you feel like, "You know, I just
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.380]   want...
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.900]   If people really had a problem, that's fine.
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.620]   But I want people to be honest and I want...
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:40.100]   Look, anybody who's worked with the public, anybody who's ran a cashier at McDonald's
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:45.100]   or anything knows that there are a small percentage of people you just can't make happen."
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:48.100]   And then people use it as a way for the use of it.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.100]   Yelp is used against...
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.140]   Yes, competitors will file negative reviews.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.180]   It's a Pandora's box.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.740]   Yeah, I don't know what the answer is.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:56.740]   I really don't.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.820]   Obviously, it's not finding brides.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:35:59.820]   That seems like a bad idea.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:00.820]   Grims maybe.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:03.660]   No, I think they should have simply...
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:11.740]   Fine, deduct $500 per bad review, but then give $500 per good review.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.740]   Then everyone would have been happy.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.740]   I think that works.
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:16.340]   I think that's against the Yelp terms of service.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.340]   It might be.
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:18.340]   Damn it.
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:20.180]   I don't think you can pay for good reviews.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.140]   So apparently, do you read fiction?
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:26.220]   You read fiction, Patrick?
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.860]   Not as much as I would want to.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.780]   Obviously, you write fiction.
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:30.780]   You must read it.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.780]   This was an electrifying article.
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:35.860]   I think one of the most important articles to be released, I'll be.
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:39.580]   And I hope all those people who are lonely right now, and ask me some why am I lonely
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.780]   and the answer is you don't read enough.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.580]   You don't read enough.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:49.380]   Science tells us people who read fiction are the best people to fall in love with.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:52.340]   They're the best people, period.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.340]   This is after study.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.340]   This is after study.
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.940]   I was amazed at how long that article went on.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.660]   It's a psychologist at York University in Canada.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:04.260]   A psychologist at the University of Toronto, both in 2006 and 2009, found that those who
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:07.660]   read fiction are capable of the most empathy and theory of mind.
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.060]   That is the ability to hold opinions, beliefs, and interests apart from their own.
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.460]   You can't read fiction without it.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:19.580]   You have to live in somebody else's world, even aliens who have a copyright problem.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:20.580]   They love music.
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:27.900]   Another study in 2010 said that the more stories children have read to them, the keener their
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.900]   theory of mind.
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:37.860]   So the study by Ann Cunningham, University of California, Berkeley, what reading does
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:38.860]   for the mind?
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:43.260]   It just goes on and on and on.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:47.420]   New School for Social Research, psychologist David Corner Kid.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:50.580]   What a great writer does is turn you into the writer.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.420]   In literary fiction, the incompleteness of the characters turns your mind to try and
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.300]   understand the minds of others.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.300]   And that's good.
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.300]   That's good.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.300]   These are the people you should fall in love with.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.620]   I think one of the other studies, I forget which one, said that merely by buying a lot
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:06.940]   of books, you can also benefit from these effects.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.940]   And especially if that book were science fiction, yeah.
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:09.940]   A couple of bucks.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.860]   Yeah, it's $2.99.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:16.340]   It's really how many empathy points per dollar.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:19.180]   Two dot 2.99 empathy points.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:20.180]   Exactly.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   Available to you.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.180]   Available to you.
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.180]   Available to you.
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.180]   Those two points, because for me, the Kindle price is $14.28.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.180]   Oh, you're in France.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:27.180]   Oh, you're in France.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.260]   You're in France.
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.500]   I'm on Amazon.com US.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:35.060]   It's still sniffing your IP.
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:37.060]   You're sniffing your IP.
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.060]   Damn IPs.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:40.100]   Well, what happens if I--
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:44.580]   Are you a member of the 900 strong authors group who wants to put Amazon out of business?
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.580]   I am not.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:48.700]   And this was one of the stories that being discount-- I mean, I literally am reconnecting
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:49.700]   today.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:51.820]   I haven't caught all of the froth about that.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.060]   Well, you started with the Hashet thing, which is kind of odious.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:01.540]   I mean, that is-- Amazon is really using its market share as a bludgeon against Hashet.
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:02.540]   So I'm empathetic to Hashet.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:07.180]   But Amazon says-- and I know-- I mean, as a buyer of books, I like this idea.
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:10.140]   Amazon says, well, we're just trying to fight for you.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.980]   Ebooks are overpriced.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.820]   They shouldn't be so expensive.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:17.540]   There's no printing press, no truck delivery, no storefront.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:20.180]   And most of them are a lot less expensive than the physical books.
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:21.380]   Well, not the paperbacks.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.220]   The hardcover, they're a lot cheaper than that.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:26.180]   And I generally buy books personally that are new and fresh.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:30.420]   And so I always feel like I'm getting a fabulous deal because I'm buying it on the Kindle
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.420]   rather than a hardcover.
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:35.100]   How do you books are almost-- in many cases, as expensive as the hardcover?
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.100]   Or more so.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.100]   Or more.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:39.100]   That bugs me.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.100]   Yeah, that's fascinating how expensive they can be.
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.100]   I've always done this.
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:43.900]   Well, in what do you books you have to record, right?
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.180]   Yeah, they have to pay somebody to record them.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.180]   There is an expense there.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:49.860]   I mean, we recorded year zero, John Hodgman read it.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:53.100]   And they had hired John Hodgman to sit in the studio for five days.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.100]   That's expensive.
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.540]   It's a $500, right?
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.620]   No, well, John, I could really set you back.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620]   No, I don't know.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620]   John's day rate is--
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:02.380]   It's a bit steeper than that.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.940]   But they knew it would sell well.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.500]   And they knew John's name on it would help it sell well.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:08.500]   Precisely, yeah.
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.500]   But they're expensive to make.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:10.500]   I didn't realize Hodgman.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.500]   Hodgman, right.
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.500]   One of the few books I actually read the physical.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.500]   Oh, really?
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:14.500]   Well, you gave me.
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:15.500]   That's right I did.
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:16.500]   I did.
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.500]   Yeah, Hodgman read the audio.
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.500]   Oh, that makes fabulous.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.740]   I'm going to go get it.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.860]   That's awesome.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:25.380]   I sat in the studio and listened to him record and that was a blast.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:26.380]   How fun is that?
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:27.380]   That was fantastic.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:28.380]   Five days it took him?
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.380]   I think it's five days.
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.380]   He has a lot of retakes.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:34.620]   Yeah, because like he went in reading it if he didn't feel the need.
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:35.620]   He still doubled.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.620]   He needed a sentence.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.940]   He'd read it again and retaken it a lot himself.
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.900]   There was somebody who was, for all intents and purposes, played a role like a director.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:43.900]   The producer, yeah.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:46.340]   The producer was there and a very, very good producer.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.780]   And it was an operation.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:51.300]   We had a room in New York with all the fancy equipment and the sound.
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.300]   Everything.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:54.300]   None of that was cheap.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.300]   No, I guess you're right.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.780]   So it should be expensive.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:02.380]   By the way, Jeff listened to the zero, zero, hodgman version and says it's great.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:03.380]   Oh, good.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:05.340]   He says OMG.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:06.540]   He read it magnificently.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:09.540]   He's John's a good reader.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.540]   He's a fabulous reader.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.540]   Well, he's an actor and I think that's what you want.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:14.060]   And he's a very good like vocal talent.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:17.740]   Like he does, he does wonderful podcasts.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:22.100]   And you know, he's very good on camera, but he's also, he's done a lot of stuff with NPR.
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:27.180]   He's very good at creating a presence and a vibe and conveying humor strictly with his
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.860]   voice, which is not something that everybody who's an actor can do.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.020]   It's a different set of skills.
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.020]   It's an amazing sense.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.860]   And I think it's partly because he somewhat grew up in the NPR world that he's so good
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.860]   at that.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:38.860]   Right.
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.780]   Well, he was a literary agent.
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:42.340]   So he knows.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.540]   So well, see, the problem is Amazon does seem to wield his power.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:50.460]   So the latest thing is as of yesterday, you could not pre-order any Disney DVDs.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460]   Oh, I didn't know.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460]   They just stopped it.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.460]   And it's because they're in negotiations with Disney.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460]   Wow.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460]   It feels a little hamfist.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:01.540]   And one reason that the courts have not taken an interest in this, I'm sure the publishers
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:05.100]   would like it, but the courts say, well, Amazon's got plenty of competition.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.580]   What about that bookstore across the street?
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:12.420]   Well, the courts also struck a mighty, mighty blow in favor of Amazon's market dominance
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:16.860]   by attacking Apple and all the major publishers.
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:21.180]   And what that, that had the net effect, and it certainly wasn't the intention, but it
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:25.300]   had the net effect of significantly strengthening Kindle's market share against NUC, which was
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.900]   already reeling.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:31.940]   And so yeah, I think that DOJ would have a, there's probably a certain amount of embarrassment
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.860]   at the DOJ right now, knowing that they had done this thing, which had the net effect
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:41.380]   of propping up Amazon's market share significantly to like turn around and find for his shots.
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:45.900]   It would look like a major mea culpa and people in Washington don't like to do that.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.580]   So I think that that's one thing that Amazon has on their side.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:51.420]   As an author, you love Amazon because they sell you a lot of books.
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:52.420]   I love Amazon.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:53.420]   They sell a lot of books.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.420]   And I'm reaching people that I wouldn't otherwise reach.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.900]   But there are a lot of authors very worried about Amazon's power.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:06.340]   That's the author's United group in support of Heshet.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:10.980]   Amazon has formed in response a readers United, readers United asking people to email the
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:12.980]   CEO of Heshette, right?
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.820]   Well, like giving his personal phone number out maybe.
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:17.460]   So you have a postcard.
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:19.620]   This was actually kind of nasty.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.020]   33 sunny side lane.
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.020]   Solliner.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:27.940]   Let's see if I can find these because they have some suggested text.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:30.140]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.860]   That is pretty aggressive.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:35.780]   This doesn't happen in France, right?
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:43.100]   Well, we have a whole other set of issues with Amazon, but this one specifically no.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:46.580]   It certainly is being discussed though.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:49.540]   And I don't know.
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.340]   I don't know which side I'd come down on this frankly.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:53.340]   I'm going to get more into this.
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:54.340]   I did not even know.
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:55.340]   You're an author.
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.340]   Yeah, I know.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:57.340]   Well, I was off.
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:59.900]   I was off John Grisham, Stephen King are part of the 900.
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.660]   They took out an ad in the New York Times pressing Amazon to resolve the dispute with
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:05.380]   Heshette.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:13.860]   Meanwhile, Amazon says to to its readers, dear readers with it being so inexpensive and
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:18.180]   that so many more people able to afford and buy and read books, you would think the literary
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:22.300]   establishment of the day that you would have celebrated the invention of the day.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:24.620]   The paperback, oh, they're talking about the old days.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.700]   Actually, this is a misquote.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:31.380]   They misquoted George Orwell in this, which is funny on two levels.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:32.820]   One, because they got it wrong.
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:38.340]   They said Orwell, they quoted Orwell saying public if publishers had any sense that combined
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.820]   against paperbacks and suppress them.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:44.340]   But really the full quote makes it clear he thinks this is a great thing.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:48.180]   The Penguin paperbacks are only six pence and he thinks it's going to sell a lot of copies
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:49.740]   in 1984.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.420]   And he says in jest, if publishers had any sense, they stopped this.
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.700]   And he said it in jest.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:59.860]   He said it in jest because he's in favor, in fact, of paperbacks.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:05.500]   That and the fact that Amazon yanked 1984 from its kindles without any warning to anybody
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:10.020]   a few years back, make this kind of dubious attribution.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.740]   What was the purpose of that again?
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.740]   There was an.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:13.740]   It was a booboo, right?
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:14.820]   No, no.
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:19.020]   There was an unlicensed copy of 84, which people had sold.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:22.900]   The problem was by deleting from the Kindle, they deleted all the notes and students were
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:28.180]   upset that their notes had been deleted as well as the 1984 text almost Orwellian.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.180]   It wasn't it.
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:30.180]   It was a little Orwellian.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:35.020]   Yeah, the thought that you could actually delete a book from somebody's breeder is.
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:38.340]   And I've had I've had Kindle lose some of my notes and highlights at different times
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.060]   and it does make my blood boil.
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:43.300]   It feels like because that feels like something that even it is something you invested a lot
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.300]   of time.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.260]   Amazon wants you to write.
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:52.300]   Dear has shed, we have noted your illegal collusion.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:56.700]   Please stop working so hard to overcharge for ebooks.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:59.500]   Quit colluding with yourself.
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.460]   Stop using your authors as leverage.
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:08.220]   And if you're an author, remember, and not all authors are united on this issue.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:09.700]   Not all.
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.620]   So in France, we have a slightly different issue.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:16.900]   We have the issue of the fact that book prices are fixed.
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:20.380]   You cannot discount them more than 5%.
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:25.500]   And that's in order to protect the small mom and pop shops.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:35.140]   So that the big chains and particularly supermarkets, yeah, they can't price down.
[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:38.620]   So are there a lot of small book shops in France?
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:43.140]   Well, the thing is they're dying anyway now because no one, you know, even if you don't
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:50.220]   go to Amazon, you're going to go to the big supermarkets and hyper, you know, the cost
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.420]   codes of France.
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:59.420]   And the idea was initially you were those stores would carry, you know, 100 to 100 different
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:04.300]   references and you wouldn't get the depth and of culture that you would get in the smaller
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:10.380]   specialized stores because the big guys would only want to get what we sell.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:17.980]   The issue is now against Amazon, you can have obviously a lot more diversity on Amazon than
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.780]   you can in any tiny store.
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:28.580]   So that law is kind of very difficult to put in place for this specific context.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:32.780]   And they also had an issue with the free shipping.
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:37.380]   They said Amazon cannot do the 5% and then they can do the free shipping.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:41.900]   And of course, Amazon turned around and did shipping for one cent.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.420]   That's right.
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:44.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:50.100]   But I mean, it's the whole show has been difficult problems with no obvious solution.
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:54.260]   And there is, I mean, they think anybody who is one of the any nerdy person who spent
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:59.060]   up a lot of time growing up in bookstores is probably a lot of most of us were.
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:00.060]   I love books.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:01.060]   Do we have that affinity?
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:05.860]   But at the same time you think of a, you know, and that that you know, the 5% thing and there's
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.460]   a lot more mom and pop shops.
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:12.460]   But another level that kind of stifles the diffusion of culture and ideas.
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:16.340]   Because you know, most people are at a point where they have to make choices between this
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:17.660]   product versus that product.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:24.140]   And if a book is $12 when the market forces would have priced it at eight, a certain percentage
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:25.780]   of people are not going to access that book.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.180]   They're not going to access those ideas.
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.420]   And that's a bad thing.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   It's tough.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.900]   There's also something to be said about ease of access.
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:40.260]   And again, you know, as we've seen many times with the internet, the old monopoly in effect
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.260]   crumbling down.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.980]   I went, let me give you an example.
[01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:48.540]   I went to the bookstore a few years ago when Game of Thrones started getting really big.
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:52.540]   And I figured, you know, I'm going to buy it to a paper version, a dead tree edition
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.300]   and read it.
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:59.140]   And I looked at the prices in French for the French versions.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:06.420]   And so what they do is that they divide each book, which is admittedly pretty big, into
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.900]   two or three small books.
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:15.540]   And each one of those is sold for between 10 and 15 euros, sometimes even more, which
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.660]   is, you know, about $150.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.300]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:22.900]   It's like $20 or so, 15 to $20.
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:28.780]   And so you have in the whole series now, I think 15 books, maybe even more, which are
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:32.380]   sold for 10 to 15 euros each.
[01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:36.980]   So you also, I mean, it's interesting.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:41.300]   I understand that the translation is going to cost you a little bit of money, but that
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:46.300]   feels like a publisher abusing their position.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:48.900]   So George feels about that.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:50.540]   Well, I don't know.
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:51.540]   I mean, I'm sure.
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:52.540]   Yeah, I have anything to say.
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:54.540]   We're not going back to Orwell.
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.540]   Are we?
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:58.740]   George R. R. Martin.
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:02.020]   So, yeah, it's definitely a very tough topic.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:07.540]   And I empathize and I understand what Amazon is saying, obviously, for their own benefit.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:14.380]   But there is something to be said about the fact that these books really have no reason
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.620]   for being that expensive.
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:20.900]   And the kicker is they could be paying more, the publishers could be paying more money
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:27.100]   to the author and keep more money to themselves or not more.
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:32.300]   But you know, there could be, in the end, there could be more money for everyone if
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:34.820]   they were relaxing a little bit.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:35.820]   Has shit.
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:38.660]   Well, depending on the price elasticity, I don't know the publishers.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:40.180]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:44.020]   Somebody in the chat room mentioned a law book.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:49.460]   I think it flew by, but it's a law book, an electronic version of a law book for $5,000.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:54.740]   And that's a place where it's clearly abusive because the students in class X have to buy
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:55.740]   it.
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.740]   And it's thousands.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:57.740]   Loonessy.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:01.380]   And that's the kind of thing that just, again, waves the red cape at the internet and causes
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:02.820]   piracy to happen.
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:05.820]   At some point, you overreach and, you know, you have Napster.
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:06.980]   Hey, I want to wrap it up.
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:07.980]   We've had a great show.
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:10.540]   But before we do, let's take a look at some of the things that happened.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:12.700]   It was a fun week on Twitch.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.620]   This is what you might have missed if you missed a show.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:15.620]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.620]   It's going to be fun.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.620]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.620]   Is that a drug reference?
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:21.620]   Tech news tonight.
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:23.420]   Kind of a big week in security.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:26.220]   We've got the Black Hat Conference happening in Las Vegas.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:31.140]   One of the things that made the news was the so-called bad USB.
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.140]   The Social Hour.
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:36.260]   Local search will evolve to the point where it understands where you go and what you like
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:37.260]   to do.
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:38.260]   And it will recommend things to you.
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:42.540]   I think the only reason you don't see other companies doing that is because it's really
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.060]   hard to credit up.
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:50.220]   Today I learned Pluto never made a full orbit around the sun from the time it was discovered
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:52.740]   to when it was declassified as a planet.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:54.460]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:59.300]   The firm reported future is releasing a report that comes to the conclusion that the Snowden
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.780]   documents forced Al-Qaeda to dramatically change the way that it communicates online.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:05.780]   Triagulation.
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:08.540]   Tech TV was such a fun place.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:09.540]   It was so alive.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.740]   We were all like, you know, that feeling.
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:15.500]   You just walked in and everyone was just really enjoying their job.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:19.620]   And it was clear how passionate people were about the programming.
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:20.620]   To it.
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:22.220]   The happiest place on earth.
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:26.740]   Last week you teased that I would be very excited.
[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.260]   You're in Mad Magazine.
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:29.260]   Chad.
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:30.260]   So amazing.
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:31.260]   You are too.
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:32.260]   So amazing.
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.620]   Oh man, that's the highlight of my life.
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:35.620]   You're in Mad Magazine.
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:36.620]   Thank you to our solo.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.820]   Yalisa and I and Chad all made an appearance in the snark tank.
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:45.780]   I cannot tell you how much my parents have been communicating with me this week.
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:46.780]   Are they excited?
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:47.780]   All about the Mad Magazine.
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:51.460]   Yeah, I've gotten from all my family.
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:53.700]   Many emails, lots of phone calls.
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.940]   To me, I mean, there's the highlight of my life.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.260]   My whole career was based around that, Mad Magazine.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.980]   And it's great you had Kevin on triangulation.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:01.980]   Yeah, that was fun.
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:02.980]   He's a fan.
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:04.780]   I mean, I love triangulation.
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:06.340]   It's such a cool format.
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:07.340]   You really...
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.340]   You've been on it.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:09.340]   I've been on it.
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:12.260]   And having been on it, I started watching it because you can really open up and have an
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:15.340]   in-depth conversation that really just couldn't be supported in any other medium.
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:16.340]   So, you know, on the air.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.660]   It's a little Charlie Rose, but we really focus on tech people.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.140]   And, yeah, it's...
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:23.140]   I love doing it.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.940]   Well, the fact that you're unbounded in terms of time.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:25.940]   Right.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:26.940]   I mean, you really can have fantastic...
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:27.940]   As is this show.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:34.100]   As the audience well knows, the many of them are jiggling their knees.
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.700]   Going, "It's going to be over soon."
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:37.700]   And thank you.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:38.700]   Who do we have?
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:40.860]   I don't even know who's on triangulation tomorrow.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:42.260]   I should have paid attention to that.
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:43.260]   A Barack Obama.
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:44.260]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:45.260]   Very excited.
[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.060]   Again, good lord.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:51.660]   It's...I don't know, but I guarantee you'll be somebody interesting and somebody fun.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:55.780]   Finally, we'll end up with a public service announcement.
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:54:04.780]   A couple of very good security service, FireEye and Foxit, have the entire crypto-locker database
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:06.420]   keys.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:12.100]   So you may remember the crypto-locker was a virus that was really ravaging computers
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:13.940]   all over the world.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:18.660]   You got an email that said somehow got you to run something that would encrypt the hard
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:23.580]   drive, pop up a message saying your hard drive is encrypted in 72 hours.
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:30.300]   If you don't give us $300 or some amount of money, we're just going to erase the encryption
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.380]   key and you will never again be able to get your data.
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:42.820]   It was a devastating hack, but the good news is because the infrastructure of crypto-locker
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.620]   was taken down in June by Operation Tovar.
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:56.220]   They actually have the master decryption keys for a lot of services that have been hacked.
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:57.740]   A lot of hard drives have been hacked.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:08.340]   If you go to decryptcryptolocker.com, FireEye and Foxit are providing free keys to unlock
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.340]   your system.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:14.420]   Clicked by crypto-locker, declined to pay or maybe you paid and didn't get the key.
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:17.260]   It's possible you may be able to un-emcrypt.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:23.900]   Right on top of this hack on Synology, NAS servers, same problems, a crypto-locker for
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:26.140]   Synology that locks them up.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:28.380]   But I think crypto-locker we can safely say is dead.
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:29.380]   Thank goodness.
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:33.420]   They made a lot of money in a very short period of time though.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:37.440]   I want to remind you because I know you're going to be super excited about who is actually
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:40.780]   on triangulation Andy Weir of the Martian.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:41.780]   I forgot.
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:42.780]   Yes.
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:43.780]   Oh my God.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:44.780]   That's great.
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:48.180]   If you read the Martian and I think everybody in our offices did because we all were so excited
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:51.460]   about this book, start with Brian Brushwood recommending it.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:53.220]   The story, it's kind of, have you read it?
[01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:54.220]   I have not.
[01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:55.220]   Oh my God.
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.140]   It's the best sci-fi in a long time since year zero.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:58.140]   Thank you.
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:01.380]   It's about a guy who gets stranded on Mars.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:04.260]   An astronaut, the rest of his team thinks he's dead.
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:05.260]   They leave.
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:06.260]   Oh, I've heard about this.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.260]   He's not dead.
[01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:11.440]   But he knows that he can't be rescued for some years because he's on Mars.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:14.120]   And he's played by Tom Hanks, right?
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.880]   And there's this volleyball that he, no, no, no, it's not.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.520]   But it is kind of Robinson Crusoe and Mars.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:19.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.820]   It's kind of is that idea.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:26.320]   But it's a science problem because I think this would be a great graduate course in something
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:30.240]   in physics because he has this limited set of tools.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.760]   He knows how long he has to survive.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:34.160]   He has to have enough food, enough water.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.800]   He manages, well, I'm not going to tell you what happens.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800]   Great book.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.800]   If you haven't read it, read it right now.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.560]   Read it tonight because it's author Andy Weir joins us tomorrow.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:44.560]   Fantastic.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:45.560]   On triangulation.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.960]   Our Brickhouse anniversary t-shirt is still available for a few more days.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:56.800]   We celebrated our third year in our new studios and we created a special unique one time only
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:00.260]   t-shirt commemorating the date.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:04.940]   And you can get it still at teespring.com/twit but only for two more weeks.
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.940]   So hustle on over there.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:13.260]   t-spring, t-w-e-spring.com/twit and proceeds of course, benefit the TwiC Brickhouse.
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.140]   We're trying to pay the light bill.
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.980]   Hey, thank you everybody for being here.
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:20.300]   Thanks to our great studio audience.
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:24.500]   If you want to be in studio, we do TwiC every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m.
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:25.500]   Eastern time.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.500]   That's 2000.
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:29.540]   No, no, it's 2200 UTC.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.740]   Email tickets at TwiC.tv.
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.020]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:37.420]   A mighty comfortable chair, I think you'll agree.
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:38.420]   We don't want you to get too comfortable.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:41.220]   We don't want anybody to fall asleep here.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:44.980]   And you can, if you can't be Air & Studio or watching on the internet, you can always
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:50.820]   get on-demand audio and video after the fact at TwiC.tv or Stitcher or the various apps.
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.900]   There are lots of ways to get into iTunes.
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:53.900]   Thank you, Patrick Beijon.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.220]   Not Patrick on Twitter.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.860]   How late is it now?
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:59.660]   It's 2.15 in the morning.
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:01.860]   Do you usually stay up this late?
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:05.740]   Well, I'm going to say yes.
[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:06.740]   Just feel bad.
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:10.100]   Do you have to work in the morning?
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:11.100]   I do.
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.100]   God, I'm so sorry.
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:13.100]   Because we're...
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:14.100]   Oh, it's fine.
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:15.900]   I'm happy to do it.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.340]   Well thank you very much for being here.
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:18.980]   It's always great to talk to you.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:23.260]   Patrick Beijon.com on the web, not Patrick on Twitter.
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:28.860]   Or you know, Frenchspin.com if you want to listen to my French shows, which include
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:30.020]   a tech show, by the way, in French.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:31.780]   He speaks impeccable French too.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.780]   I might add.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:36.020]   Yeah, I have a little bit of an American accent.
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.020]   I bet you do.
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.020]   Don't do that.
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:39.500]   Robert, it's always a pleasure to have you.
[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:43.260]   I can't wait for the new novel, but the year zero is now $2.99.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:44.260]   This week only.
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:45.740]   This week only at Amazon.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:48.740]   Thank you to Random House for making that possible.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.220]   And I was very specific with them.
[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:53.940]   I said I was going to be on your show and it would be great to do a discount this week
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:54.940]   while we're here.
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:56.100]   They said, "Well, only four or five people.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:58.300]   Listen, we probably don't have to worry about that."
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.460]   Everybody buy it.
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:00.460]   Prove them wrong.
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.460]   Yes.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:03.660]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:05.500]   No, that's pretty much it.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:09.500]   Well, except for the fact that if you do read a lot of books, you're one of the best
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:10.500]   people in the world to marry.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.500]   Absolutely.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:14.420]   Now I have certain bachelor friends who would run screaming from that.
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:15.540]   No, you can read the books.
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.540]   Just don't talk about them.
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:17.540]   Exactly.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:18.540]   Okay.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:19.540]   Just read them.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:20.540]   That's all we ask.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:21.540]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:22.540]   We'll see you next time.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:23.540]   Another Twit.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.540]   This is in the canyon.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:25.540]   Bye-bye.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.540]   Do the Twit.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:27.540]   Do the Twit.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:28.540]   All right.
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:29.540]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:30.540]   Do the Twit.
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:34.540]   Do the twist, alright. Do the twist, baby.
