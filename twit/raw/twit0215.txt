[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.840]   Well, not all of them.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.200]   That really not even a large portion.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.960]   In fact, frankly, we just cover whatever weed the hell want to cover.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.240]   And despite the administrations of Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.000]   Who tries to keep us moving, tries to keep us covering tech.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.800]   What is that?
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   I knew how.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.760]   John's showing us a picture of his shed.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.360]   It's my new house.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.280]   What are you, a gold miner?
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.840]   What is my 401k?

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.200]   That's all that's left.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.840]   Channeldevorak.com, if you want to find out, are you going to blog that?
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   Why do you have a snapshot of a shanty?
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.440]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.200]   I took this somewhere in Wyoming.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.040]   It's a great picture.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.440]   It looks like a ghost town.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.000]   Actually, after I've sent you the Photoshop version, it's quite nice.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.880]   I'm using it as a background for a new thing I'm doing from Evio called the Tech Grouch.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.840]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.320]   Do you sit on the porch on a rock and chair with a shotgun?
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.160]   I got a beard.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   I got the --
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400]   Hey, I'm John C. Devorak, the Tech Grouch.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.000]   No, no, no, I'm not John C. Devorak.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   This is somebody else.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.040]   Aren't you tired of being the cranky, grouchy guy?
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   Don't you want to be like --
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   You?
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.640]   Yeah, like me, Mr. Nice Guy.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   Yeah, I do.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.440]   I've always wanted to be like you, Leo.

[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.640]   Also here, Will Harris from ChannelFlip.com.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   Hi, Will.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   How are you today?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   Hello.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   I'm very well.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   Thank you.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   I've got my glass of port and I'm very happy.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   Oh, that looks good.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   A little late in the evening for a port.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   Nice, isn't it?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   A little 20, little 20, 10-year.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   10-year, Tony port.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   It's like show and tell-on to it today.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.240]   You're supposed to have Frank Barnico on the line and he's -- I think, you know, as this
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.160]   happens all the time, people are about to appear on the show and then their internet
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   goes out.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.120]   Do you think it's this conspiracy of some kind?
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.280]   You're out to get your lead.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.640]   Maybe just -- yeah, just the -- yeah, like they never use Skype and then as soon as they
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.200]   start using a lot of bandwidth.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.240]   The whole Internet just goes -- come along.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.240]   -- come bluey.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.320]   It's too bad because Frank wrote a blog post that I thought was very interesting why bloggers
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.600]   and podcasters should be happy about the idea that Comcast might be buying 51% of NBC
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   Universal.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.560]   Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, you know, my experience not getting bumped from the show
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   has been that I watched it live.twit.tv and you're talking about me.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.240]   And nobody picks up -- tries to -- I don't know what happens.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.320]   But he's probably listening right now and he probably will get back onto the show within
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   the next two minutes.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.400]   What do you -- do you think, first of all, that this is this rumor which, in fact, Comcast
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.800]   is -- well, maybe it's one of those nined and niled and niled but it seems like they've
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   denied it.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.000]   No, it's a total non-denial denial.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.600]   You think the first story the Ed with the Comcast was buying NBC Universal 100%?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   Ah.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.480]   And the non-denial denial was that story is not accurate.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   Right.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.240]   Yes, there's just between not accurate and not true.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.360]   So you think it's true, they're going to have a controlling interest.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.920]   I think it's true, too.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.480]   Is this -- you know, I mean, my first thought is that this is the way Comcast can keep companies
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.040]   like -- they can't buy everybody, but NBC's been very, very active first with Hulu and
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.360]   then with their own site and putting shows online.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.000]   Companies like Comcast hate that because it means people can watch those shows using cheap
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.320]   Internet access instead of expensive premium cable access.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   Yeah, but they're using the Internet -- the so-called cheap Internet access is actually
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.520]   an expensive Comcast Internet access, generally.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.200]   But you need to get some bandwidth if you want to watch TV on your -- through the Internet.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.520]   Yeah, but Comcast, what do they get for Internet access?
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   50 bucks.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.320]   But your cable bill is, I bet you well over 100 bucks because of all the, you know, premium
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   stuff that they watch.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.520]   I use a satellite dish.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   Ah.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.120]   How much is your satellite?
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.280]   I think they're 50 bucks, something like that.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   I just -- my sense is, and maybe I'm wrong, that the cable companies hate the idea of
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.440]   people just using their bandwidth.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.680]   Yeah, but they're not idiots.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.080]   They know it's a done deal.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.840]   Yeah, I guess it is a done deal, isn't it?
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   Nothing.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   Yeah, so they got to take defense of the measures.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.400]   And I think this is a good one.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.280]   Yeah, I guess if you feel like the entire world is migrating from cable to IPTV as a cable
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   company, you kind of feel like you need a stake in TV.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.320]   Yeah, you and I, you and I will are doing IPTV plays basically.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.560]   So I, you know, I love the idea.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.040]   I think the thing that gives us a, I think a little bit of a leg up is that, and this
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.200]   is always true when businesses change dramatically like this, that the old, old line business
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.960]   can't afford to cannibalize their, you know, their business.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   And so --
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.200]   Well, what I can't do, I mean, you can't, you know, it's a massive, old line business.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.440]   Opportunity, because for smaller players coming into the market, there's no opportunity
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   cost.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   Right.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   Right.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   Everything is upside.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.880]   Whereas if you're, you know, an incumbent, then there's a lot of downside to go with a
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.160]   potential amount of upside.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.040]   There's a lot of people right now talking about, you know, whether it's the New York
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.400]   Times or all the recent paywalls, et cetera, you know, is the internet going to make up
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.280]   for the shortfall in traditional revenue streams?
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.400]   Whereas the question for, you know, for people like you is, well, I don't have a traditional
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.000]   revenue stream to protect the internet.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Right.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   All money.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.320]   It's all money all the time.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.200]   I want to apologize because, you know, I gave a speech on Friday.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.600]   I thought it was just, you know, a small group of people.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.680]   And a lot of them were young people or people who were kind of trying to figure out how
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.520]   they can make this move to the internet.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.200]   And so I wanted to reassure them, I was talking a little bit about tech TV and how it failed
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.480]   because advertisers really didn't have faith in broadcasting intended for intelligent audiences.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.840]   They just thought, intelligent people are going to watch the ads.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.960]   They're just going to decide what to buy because they're intelligent.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.000]   We can't influence them.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.560]   And I wanted to make the point to these young people and these, and these people in transition
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   that in fact, you could do a smart network.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.880]   Twits been nothing but aimed at intelligent people and make a living.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.520]   So I told them what we, you know, kind of our revenue situation.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.600]   And of course that became the big story all over the internet as if, you know, like I'm
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280]   rolling in dough or something.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   You are.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   Sounds like a demean.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   Well, there's costs.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.480]   There's in taxes.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.080]   It's not that I don't write myself a million dollar check last month.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.640]   Actually, it's really, really funny because I did a, I did a talk at TechCrunch TechCrunch
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.720]   in London a couple of weeks ago in which I mentioned that it was really, really hard
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.640]   to get a sense of the new media world in Britain because nobody really talked about money.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.280]   It was a very British thing about, you know, nobody likes to talk about money.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.840]   You know, mentioned money.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.200]   And we hear you, Frank, hang on.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.280]   And, and, you know, and I mentioned that in America, you know, talking about money is
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.480]   a much more open thing and everybody tries to help each other.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.200]   Every person tries to be free with information in the spirit of entrepreneurship.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.440]   And of course, this thing came out a week later and I was like, see, I think that proved
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   the point.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   See, by the way, you know what reminds me of it reminds me of, I was talking to somebody
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.640]   from England the other day and they were buying a, you know, a house around here.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.840]   I said, so what'd you pay for?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.120]   Oh, by the way, in California, I told them, I said, in California, we tell people what
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.400]   we pay for our houses and what, you know, what we sold them for.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   This is what we do.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   That's right.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.920]   We got no, we have no shame or pride.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.480]   I know it's ghost to talk about money and I wouldn't normally, I wouldn't walk up to
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   see.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.760]   There's, there's beyond it.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.240]   Yeah, it's gosh, and an old sense, but that old sense, it senses a structured management
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.480]   style that was designed to keep people from actually knowing what other people made so
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.880]   you could screw them.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   That's really true.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.280]   Every, and I tell my employees this, don't you dare tell anybody else what you make because
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   it just cause jealousy and you'll all want more money.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   So your management now.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.240]   Yeah, management now.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.680]   Anyway, hey, Frank, we got Frank Barnaco.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.920]   I'm sorry, Barnaco on.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.920]   Thank you, Frank.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   I really appreciate it.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.560]   It looked like we lost you.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.240]   All that took was a shutdown.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.000]   And the starting always helps.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.900]   So it's a kind of laughing because my father in law is a windows guy and I, I'm always
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   tweaking him.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.120]   So I'm hoping he's not watching.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   But it wasn't a Mac you were using Windows seven, right, Frank?
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   Too late.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.840]   Frank, you've been on Twitter before, but not for a long, long time.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   Right.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   Long time ago.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   Yes.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.340]   About time we got you back.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.120]   Go ahead.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.680]   I was just going to say was back when there was, I think there was only one show and now
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   look at you.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   Really?
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   Is that true?
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680]   Now, that's kind of amazing.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.480]   There may have been Mac great.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.880]   He thought it was first.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.440]   So let's get to that article that Frank wrote.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.240]   I'm glad we got you on because we really wanted to talk about this NBC Comcast deal,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.280]   which in your absence we've concluded is in fact a real deal despite Comcast's non denial
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.480]   denial.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.480]   Do you agree, Frank?
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   This is probably what's going to happen.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.720]   Well, I think that Comcast certainly wants to do it.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.960]   They tried to do Disney for what?
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.360]   X number of billion dollars a few years ago.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.120]   Who hasn't tried to do Disney?
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.560]   The Comcast people clearly want to have content.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.480]   And as I put on the blog and I was thinking about it, you know, all these folks and, you
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.000]   know, I didn't say you Leo, but clearly you're the archetype out there.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.520]   You're the model.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.640]   And I think that Comcast is going to want to have more content available to sell to its
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.080]   subscribers and to other subscribers.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.400]   And the best way to generate more dollars is to have content that can't be gotten any
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.600]   place else.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.320]   And I think podcasters and bloodcasters have a real opportunity here that Comcast will
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.440]   look for more and more content.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.720]   And God knows the Internet is producing it right and left in those niches that each of
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.160]   us cares about, although they are different niches and they add up to a big audience.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.560]   You don't think it's a defensive move from Comcast that they're just saying, boy, we're
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   going to get eaten a lot.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.800]   Because really Comcast's business is purely a delivery mechanism.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.320]   Although they did have Liberty Media, they have in the past toyed with content creation.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.760]   In fact, they spun it out.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.280]   I think that they seems they're a little skitzo.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   They can't decide if they want to be in content creation or just distribution.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.280]   But it seems to me now that it's clear that distribution is not where the money is going
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   to be.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.480]   It's going to be creating content, yes?
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.640]   I believe that's true.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:55.240]   And as a content creator, I and you both know that distribution is critical to the, it's
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.480]   the lifeblood of anybody who's making content.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.960]   And Comcast has that big pipe.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   They do.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.560]   And they avoid ending up being just a pipe if they have extra special content.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.600]   Again, I'm thinking about the Roku box and how Netflix is putting itself into various
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   places.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.960]   So it is a content option.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.440]   And I think Comcast is clearly thinking down the road.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.080]   Yes, they want to have as many subscribers as they can.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.240]   It sounds like 22 million now.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.800]   And I just think the more content they got, the more subscribers they're going to have
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.560]   and the more content they've got that they can sell that should make sponsors a little
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   bit of dollars.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   I'd like to see that.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   I'd like to say something.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   I mean, you're in this too.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.800]   Yeah, I mean, I have to say, I think in the long run, the money is not actually in content.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.520]   It's actually in distribution aggregation.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.560]   Oh, in aggregation, I think what Channel does as an aggregator.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.920]   Well, I think content, what we're seeing is an explosion of content as you've talked
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.560]   about content has never been, there's never been more content and content has never been
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.720]   cheaper or easier to produce and that leads to a proliferation and at least to a devaluation
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   in the marketplace.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   You're already seeing the number of TV commissions go down, the budgets for TV commissions go
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   down.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.040]   That's going to keep going down and keep going down and keep going down.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.840]   I think when you look at what's where value is in this kind of new economy, you have to
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:31.640]   look at what's scarce because we're looking at proliferation creates scarcity, right?
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.040]   The irony, the proliferation of media online and the massive amounts of media online creates
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:43.560]   a scarcity in terms of large audiences because everybody's watching lots of different things
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.800]   which means the audience for each thing is smaller.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:51.360]   So actually the value in this kind of new economy is in the aggregation of large audiences,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:14:00.080]   not in the production of content, which kind of becomes a thing of little value above its
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   product.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.800]   It's not, it's a commodity.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   John, you agree?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.640]   I mean, you work for, you work for media.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.920]   Well, and they're, I mean, they're the first podcast aggregator ever.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.520]   And they keep, and the model has changed.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   I sense since I got there a couple of years ago, I would say that the model has changed
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.760]   six, seven times.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.040]   No, seriously, but I mean, not for the worst.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.520]   I mean, every time they look at the model and they say, well, you know what we should
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.920]   do is this and what we should do is this and what we should do is this and they keep
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   changing.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.520]   It's a symbol in this world because we know.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.840]   No, but he knows what the real, what the end, what the end model is because everybody's
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   experimenting.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.000]   I mean, you have an operation that is making it up as we go along.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.400]   It's a one man show that is extreme, you know, that that will, that could go on forever
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.200]   and may have to change it may not or maybe someone will just buy you the folks, folks
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   in media.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.480]   And now they have so much aggregation going on and they're doing these split deals with
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.640]   all these different producers.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.360]   Some people are making quite a bit of money, not your kind of money, but they're making
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   a lot of money.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.760]   I think I think Adam Curry said that he had three podcasts making half a million to a
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.160]   million a year.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.560]   I know of a couple making over 200,000.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.720]   I don't look at those numbers, but I know at least two that make over 200,000.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.960]   I think Callie Lewis makes it.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.280]   Sure, Callie must make that much.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.760]   I think she makes a quarter of a million dollars.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.080]   She, that's, I don't know if that's the money to her and I don't know if Adam's going.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.520]   No, no, this would be the money to her.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   Okay.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.280]   Because I think I was probably quoting the, yeah, they split it.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.840]   So she was quoting the revenue, total revenue, and then the amount of money to her is half
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   that.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.960]   But, and she only does a few shows.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   And she's not the big money winner.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.880]   There's two other shows that I've never even heard of that make her.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   They're bigger.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   But they're not about tech.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   They're like, I don't know what they're about.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.880]   It's interesting.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.280]   See, I kind of will and go ahead, Frank.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:53.520]   I think Will and John are making the same point I was writing about, thinking about Comcast
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.960]   is not going to want to have onesie-toozy aggregator, onesie-toozy podcasts and video
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.040]   shows on a, on a long menu.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.680]   It is just as you've done with the Twit Network.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.920]   It's a, it's a 24/7 wheel of tech content.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.680]   You give me a 24/7 wheel of digital photography content and I'm going to watch that.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.920]   I'm going to pay three or four dollars a month for that channel.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.480]   So the person who puts together, as you've done, the kind of niche programming into a
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   format that is easily handled by a cable company that distributions know they don't
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.400]   have to worry about whether all the lines are working, whether the shows have arrived
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   on time.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.200]   But they, in effect, they do just become the distribution.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   They become the marketer.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.840]   They make a piece selling it to subscribers and that aggregator who's put it all together,
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.480]   that's the one that has the right opportunity.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.560]   Now here's, I'm going to throw a monkey wrench in this.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   Go ahead, go ahead, John.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.760]   I was going to say, well, actually throw the monkey wrench in it.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.680]   I have a plug, David Spark wrote a really good column about making money as a podcaster
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   that I want to plug.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.960]   Yeah, he left me out of that.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.600]   I felt a little hurt, to be honest.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   Did he?
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   Oh, you saw the article?
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   Yeah, it was a very good article.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.200]   And that's where I got that 500,000 to a million figure from.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.680]   Oh, well, you know, I think it was, he was remiss to leave you out, but I, that's because
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.720]   you know why he left me?
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.680]   He goes, he's asked me many times to be on Twitch and I don't have, he's a PR guy.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.960]   I don't put PR guys on Twitter.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.960]   All right.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.160]   Yeah, he probably left you out on purpose.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   He snubbed you.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160]   He snubbed.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160]   I'm snubbed.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   You know how easy I am to a fan.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   Screw you Spark.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   David's a very huge spotter.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.960]   David's a very funny, great comic, old friend, worked together at Tech TV and I'm sure.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.520]   Well, anyway, just he has these nine models and they're the most accurate models I've
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.800]   ever seen put in one article.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.920]   No, it's, it's, it's an excellent article and I highly recommend it.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.920]   Is that on his blog?
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   Where does that get posted?
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.520]   Social masher mashups or some machema mania or something?
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.000]   I don't know what it is, but look up David Spark podcasting and you'll probably find
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   it.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Yeah, I thought that was excellent article.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   So here's my monkey wrench.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.600]   I've been reading accidental billionaires, which is the Ben Mesrick book.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.040]   It's going to be a movie any minute now, Justin Timberlake playing Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   It's on the story.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   The fan.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   It's, I think highly fictionalized story of the founding of Facebook, but it did kind
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.800]   of like came on for me and I'm sorry if I'm slow to this party, but it's very obvious
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:23.640]   to me that going forward advertisers are no longer going to be satisfied with scattershot
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.960]   advertising, the kind they get even on this show a little bit.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.560]   They're going to want to know more and more about the people they advertise to.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.920]   And this is what Google and Facebook offer them.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.880]   They can say, I want, I want the five best, biggest dentists in Muncie.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.480]   I want the one person who's going to buy a big screen TV in, in Petaluma, California.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   They can be very, very specific, which makes their ads incredibly more efficient.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.880]   And I think platforms like Facebook and Google are going to be a problem for even internet
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.680]   broadcasters because we just can't get that granular.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.680]   What do you think?
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:08.360]   I think we lost Frank for one thing, but I have a, I, this is the Holy Grail of advertisers.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   Exactly.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   That's what they want.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   Well, you know, it's not achievable.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.640]   I think it's a wishful thinking situation.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.440]   That's why you have to do advertising in the first place.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.800]   Well, don't Facebook, don't Facebook and Google give them exactly that.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.200]   Do you give you, do you give you that kind of granularity and they do give you that kind
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   of access?
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   Well, they don't give you, you know, either yet or conceivably at all.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.640]   Is any kind of nice way of exploiting that?
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.720]   I mean, advertising, advertising as a culture, as an industry, is about touchy, feely kind
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.360]   of, you know, reaching into your emotions and motivating you to do stuff.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.840]   No, that's what, see, this is where you're wrong.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.400]   That's old school advertising.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.240]   That's, you know, that's coercive advertising.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.640]   Oh, here we go.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.160]   I think the advertising model is moving away from coercion and tricks and is moving towards
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.640]   influence.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.640]   The most successful.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   It's about creativity.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.640]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.640]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   - You know, this article comes from PC Magazine, it's kind of interesting, hmm?
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   - Just saying. - Just saying.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   Um, Balmer's pay dropped from 1.34 million to 1.265.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   Robbie Bach, wow, wait a minute.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   This doesn't sound right, the CEO made 1.3 million last year.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   Robbie Bach, who is the president of the Entertainment Devices Division,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   made 6 million. If I'm Balmer, I'm pissed.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   - No, Balmer doesn't need the money, A, and B, there's probably some sort of
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   bonus thing or something going on with Bach's salary.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   He probably did a really good job of making money for the company.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   - Yeah, I guess he did, Xbox, you know, and he made 8 salary for it.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   - Now salary for it. - Plus bonus plus stock options.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   - Right. This is total compensation numbers.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   CFO got 3.5 million compared to 4.8 million a year earlier.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   CFO O'Kevin Turner drops from, he was making 8 million, 8.6 million to 5.4.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   Poor Balmer, he's like, he's like the poor kid up.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   - Balmer's got something else going on. - Oh, sorry for him.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   - He gets 10 bucks per autographed copy of Windows 7 for the Microsoft party.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   - I'm going to send him $10. That's what I'm going to do.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   Maybe Balmer should have like a PayPal tip jar in the Microsoft site.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   - Speaking of Microsoft's quarter and the results, and Windows 7,
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   do you think that the Windows 7 is going to key off an IT rush?
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   Lots of upgrades. I'm reading something on the web today that says,
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   IT managers have been sitting with XP for, let's call it, 2001 technology,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   so they've been sitting with it for almost a decade.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   Are companies going to really go out there and make the switch now to Windows 7
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   and is that going to help Microsoft?
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.640]   - This is an interesting, it's a great question.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   In the past, when a new version of Windows comes out,
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   it's very good for the PC marketplace.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   Boy, the PC marketplace could really use it right now.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   They're just struggling.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   I think this is going to be one of those times where people say,
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   "Yeah, XP's fine."
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   It still runs, it's still supported. Microsoft has an end of life.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   I predict that in fact, you're not going to see this big buy,
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   and that this is going to be a further bad news in Microsoft's bottom line.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   What do you think, John?
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.640]   - Well, I've already predicted that it would have a positive impact.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   I did this some months ago.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.640]   - You don't change that? - You don't change that?
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   - No, I'm not saying it's not going to have the impact of Windows 95
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   or even Windows 98 or any of the big monster hits that Microsoft has had in the past.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.640]   Windows 2000 was a big hit.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   They had a string of hits, Windows 2000, Windows XP.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   These things all did very well.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   Then they had a Vista, which was their first flop in terms of hits.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   Then they got this coming out. Everybody seems to like it.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Looks pretty cool. I don't think it's going to be a mega hit,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   but I think it's going to be in line with Windows 98,
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   which is a moderate hit.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   I think it will help their finances a little bit.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   I think they're doing, at least they're trying to do some interesting things
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   with these parties and some other events and promotions.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   - Yeah, but I noticed that all the marketing that I've seen
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   is aimed at the consumer, that they're trying to sell the consumer.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   They want the consumer to buy a new PC,
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   but really business is what makes or breaks Microsoft,
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   makes or breaks PC makers.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.640]   I think business is not swayed by this.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   I don't think the marketing to business has been compelling at all for Windows 7.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   - Well, Microsoft sticks with this theory that they can pull it through
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   the consumer part of the business.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   In other words, I'm a consumer, say I run a business,
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   but I also have a computer at home and I get jacked up on Windows 7
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   or my neighbors do or something. I see it, I like it, I start using it,
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.640]   and then I give the go ahead to the IT department, go buy it.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   I don't think that's a bad process.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   How are they going to market directly to businesses anyway nowadays?
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   I mean, through computer world, I mean, it's a pamphlet.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.640]   I mean, there's no platform anymore.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   - No, I mean, these companies basically screwed the pooch
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.640]   by letting all their conduits for information die essentially,
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.640]   and now they don't have any way of talking to the businessman.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   I mean, look at business week, it's borderline going out of business itself,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   and this is the main business publication in the country.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   - What do you think, Will?
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   - I think the Wall Street folks are on your side.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   Right now, the stock Microsoft is selling at 25.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.640]   It crossed 30 or 31 maybe in the past six months, but the stock is just flat.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   I mean, it's been dead money for five years.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   - It's been a pathetic stock, hasn't it?
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.640]   For a company that is so dominant, that has so many successful products,
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   and John and I, we've been talking about this for four years.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.640]   What's wrong with Microsoft stock?
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.640]   - Will, I think the one with Microsoft's.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   - Will, I want to ask you, because we asked everybody,
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   I'd love to get everybody on record on this.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   Windows 7, will there, will it be a big boost for the PC industry,
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.640]   or will people just go, I'm sticking with XP, particularly in business?
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   - It's not going to be a huge boost for the PC industry,
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   because I don't believe that at the moment a new operating system
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   is top of people's wish lists for things in a PC.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   I think it will have a much better critical and popular reception,
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.640]   because I think people will be getting it on, you know,
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   netbooks and laptops primarily, and I think that, you know,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   they will like a lot more than that.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   I don't think businesses are going to be in a hurry to move to it,
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   because again, you know, I don't think there's,
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   the businesses right now aren't crying out for a new version of Windows.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   - I don't think, I think exactly right, they're happy with XP.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.640]   - And unless Microsoft says we're going to kill XP,
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   and I don't think they can, you know, and by the way,
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.640]   this is no knock on Windows 7, I say it again.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   I think it's really the best version of Windows, probably since, ever.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   - Yeah, I would agree, it's certainly, you know,
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   it's the best version of Windows that Microsoft have released
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   in the past decade probably.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   - Easily.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   - I think it's as great as the late-limited Windows 2000.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   - That's how good I think it is.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   - Oh, Windows 2000, still a great product, still works.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   - I thought I'd get some laughs out of that.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   Instead, I get moans of joy and pleasure.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   - People who have three hours in tremendous operating system.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   - It really was.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   In fact, I was-- - I found my--
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   - Go ahead, Frank.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   - I found myself this summer needing to boot up
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   and run Microsoft money, which they're taking away from me,
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   and let me don't get me started on that.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   - They are, they're going out of that business, yeah.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   - Yeah, and come on into it, where is the conversion program?
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   I need that.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.640]   - Yeah.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   - I need that.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.640]   But I had a three-year-old, laptop is probably five years old,
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   and it had Windows 2000 on it, and I booted it up,
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.640]   and it ran fine.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   Who knows what downloads and updates it took in when I booted it up
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   after being dormant for three years worked fine.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   - My mom, I put my mom on Windows 2000,
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   I've moved her to Mac since, but she was on Windows 2000.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   But all by herself, without any virus,
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   just it normally secured Windows 2000,
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.640]   ran flawlessly perfect, it's still running.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.640]   It was on a Dell refurb, never got a virus, never got a bug.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   I mean, it was rock solid.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.640]   - I have to say, the mom moved to Mac,
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   I think is becoming the must-have geek move of 2008, 2009.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.640]   - It is.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   - Because I've done the exact same thing at the end of last year.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   - And she's using it quick and on the Mac, by the way.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.640]   - I used to get a phone call every week,
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   sometimes two a week from my mother with,
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.640]   this is downloaded, well, there's a screen that's come up that says,
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   this is the right thing, I think I've got this virus.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   I went home, I bought her a Mac mini, I connected it up.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   I put Microsoft Word on it so she could do all the letters
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   and she uses hot mail so she can do a little email.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   And I literally, I don't think I've had,
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   I probably had one call in the last 12 months
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   where she couldn't work out something, but no viruses, no spam,
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.640]   no nothing, it's been like, I highly advise anybody whose mother
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   is still on Windows to go and get them a Mac.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   - You know, you're maligning mothers all over the world, many moms.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   - There's boneheads.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   - Yeah, many moms are more sophisticated than we are.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   I bet you there's moms out there who are writing Haskell code right now
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   for their database on the website.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   They're about to take over Facebook.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   - Leo, I just registered mom to Mac.com.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.640]   - Very wise man, good investment Frank.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   You know what I've been using Frank in lieu of quicken or Microsoft money is mint.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   Quick into it just bought mint, but I love mint.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:09.640]   Now it's not quite the same because you don't really balance your checkbook.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   You just let the bank tell mint and all your financial institutions mint what's going on,
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   but you get this great dashboard.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   - Mint is the one product I wish was available in the UK.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   - You got Spotify, we got mint.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   - I wonder why it's not.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   - Mint would be more helpful to be honest.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   - The problem with Microsoft money mints all well and good,
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   but Microsoft money has all the investment records, all the portfolio,
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   the transactions, the holdings, the profits gained.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   - So come text and that's much more.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.640]   - Yeah, and right now anybody with Microsoft money and there's millions of them,
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   remember Microsoft tried to buy into it.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.640]   They really thought that business was going to be something and they just let it peter away.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   - I don't get Microsoft in some of these things.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   They're almost like a little kid that loses interest.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   They're all jacked up about buying into it and getting into that industry
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.640]   and doing all, you know, becoming another big player there.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   I'm worried now that if they had to buy into it, they'd lose interest
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   and we wouldn't even have into it.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   I mean, these guys are like, now why would they drop Microsoft money?
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   Is it losing tons of dough for them or is it just marginally profitable?
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   I mean, what's the problem?
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   - The only service that Microsoft money provides and it's critical to somebody
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   in the portfolio is that updating of stocks on a daily or weekly basis,
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   whatever you want to do, but that's data that is loaded into the program.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   Well, without how much money can that cost continue to provide that service
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   because the software once done is done.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   They haven't updated the software in two or three years, so it's not a big deal.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   It's not a project they have to keep managing and moving along
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   and to take care of competition.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:57.640]   And now didn't we just read this week that Microsoft is talking to,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.640]   is it Bank of America about doing a mint.com kind of product?
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:02.640]   - Yeah.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   You know what I really think is happening at Microsoft,
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.640]   and I don't think that they're wrong in this,
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   is that they realize that desktop software is not a, there's no future in it.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.640]   That they see companies like Mint, they see web-based services like that
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   and that's really being the future.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:25.640]   I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft introduces something similar in its live family.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   If I were Yahoo, I mean Yahoo's got this great finance page,
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   I start looking, getting some web developers in there
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.640]   and working on that real quick because I think that that's where Mint really underscored for me
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   the value of just letting the software take care of it all.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   - Well, of course, the irony about Mint was that it didn't actually really own any of its own software, right?
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   - Right.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   - It was built on a third platform.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   - It was a front end.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   - It made 170, you know, it's a classic story.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   They made 170 million dollars for a front end.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   And the company was a Yodelie that makes the back end, they got squat.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   They got a new customer.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.640]   - Mm.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   - It's not unusual.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   I mean, front end is everything.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   - It's all window dressing.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.640]   - It's all, well, see, that's what I think, I have to think.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.640]   I think Ray Aussie is some part of this strategy as well because, of course,
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.640]   he's very cloud focused.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:19.640]   I think Microsoft is repositioning itself and really believes that desktop software has no future,
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   that it's all kind of beautiful.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.640]   - See, I think that's faulty thinking.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   - Do you think that--
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.640]   - Do you think that--
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   - You might want--
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.640]   - You might want--
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   - I think that's faulty thinking on my part of Microsoft's part.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   Do you think that this is what Microsoft's thinking?
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   - I know I agree with everything you say.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   I'm just saying I think it's faulty thinking that to think that desktop software is dead is over.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   - I don't know.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   I think maybe the computer is dead, to be honest with you.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.640]   The computer is we know it.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.640]   - You don't like that.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   - We have the--
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   - Let me see.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   - I think you're onto something with this idea and I wanted to mention it to go back and
[00:59:52.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   beat the Windows 7 horse because if we're moving to the cloud with our software, we're putting our data up there,
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   we're using it from any computer, the net is now the computer.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   - Yes.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   - What do you need a new OS for?
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   - You don't.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   You just need a good browser.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   - Yeah, I went to the net, goes down and tell me what you think after that happens.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640]   - Oh, we'll go get some fresh air.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   It'll be a good thing.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   It won't be down long.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   What do you think it's going to be down for more than a minute?
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   - You don't think it could be just taken down?
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640]   - Like for how long?
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   A day?
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.640]   - A month.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   - This is Adam Curry again.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   - Yeah.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   - Month.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   - A month would be--oh, look.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   Even as we stand now with the reliance on desktop software, the net goes down for a month.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   It's terrible news.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   I don't think it's any worse than if you're all cloud-based.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   It's bad news in general.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.640]   - Not if you're Stephen King.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   - What's the steal?
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   - Type it away.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   Type it away for a month.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   - Is he going to type writer?
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.280]   - Well, I mean on this keyboard.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.280]   He probably does.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   - Yeah.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.800]   Well, I mean, nobody's saying you don't have--nobody's saying you have no way of typing.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.240]   - I have--look at some of this, just cloud stuff.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.560]   I have a lot of photos.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.560]   They're huge.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.720]   The file sizes are monstrous because everything I save is in raw.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.640]   So I have a bunch of ways of organizing these photos.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.360]   And if I do it on the cloud, I'll be sitting here forever either trying to access these
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.920]   things or uploading them or doing all this other nonsense that's much better done locally.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.760]   And this is the same thing for--like, I look at the PayPal account that I've got.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.560]   And I want to go from page to page to page.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.560]   It's like takes forever just to refresh the page.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.280]   And this is on a 10-megabit connection.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   I mean, come on.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.960]   I mean, there's plenty of things that should be locally done.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.120]   I mean, this cloud thing is overrated.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.400]   - I've got to play you this video.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.120]   And by the way, Larry Ellison agrees with me.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.440]   - I got to play you this video.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.280]   Larry Ellison hates cloud computing.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.640]   Via Devorek Uncensored, I might add.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.880]   - And it won't play, John.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.040]   The cloud is dead.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.440]   - There you have it.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.880]   There you go.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.880]   - The cloud never--
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.040]   - We had a lyrical copy of your podcast.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.600]   - You're playing it as a big cloud.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.280]   - Now I'll tell you why you're wrong, John.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.560]   I'll tell you exactly why you're wrong.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.760]   - Because you're gonna die and your poor kids
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.960]   are gonna have eight million tons of raw photos.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.560]   They're gonna, if they're just gonna delete the data.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.680]   They're gonna delete the data.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.240]   If they were in Picasa, at least online in a photo album,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.840]   somebody might look at it someday.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.520]   It's, you're creating a data dump for nobody.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   And I--
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.840]   - I'm using these.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.600]   For me, I don't care about my kids having access to my own photo.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.040]   - Are you gonna look at those pictures?
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.360]   - Oh, please.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.200]   - You're never gonna look at them.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.200]   - This cloud thing is a cornball idea.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.720]   Larry Ellison is dead right.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.880]   - Let me play, unfortunately, the audio is not great
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.640]   on the Larry Ellison thing, but let me play it anyway.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.480]   And you can kind of try to make it.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   (audience laughs)
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.320]   - And it's hidden.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.160]   - It's better to throw it out.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.480]   - It is.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.320]   - I don't know if we can understand.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.160]   - All I have to judge the cloud computer is the fact
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.280]   that everyone, this is, you know, cloud computing
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.160]   is not only the future of computing.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.120]   It is the presence and the entire past of computing
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.360]   is all cloud.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.440]   I mean, salesforce.com has been around
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.720]   for more than a decade.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.760]   And so does NetSuite.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.560]   You know, NetSuite's been around longer
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.960]   than the salesforce and it's,
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.080]   he was saying, well, that's cloud computing.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.880]   You know, Google's now cloud computing.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.200]   Everyone's cloud computing.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.360]   My injection cloud computing, was everyone's
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.560]   single looks around?
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.480]   Other than like, yeah, like I've always been doing
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.680]   cloud computing.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.560]   (audience laughs)
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.000]   You know, it's like, yeah, like 10 years ago,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.920]   but the term is like, yeah, but I haven't.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.480]   - That's not an objection.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.440]   He's just saying, it's meaningless.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.320]   He's saying the term is kind of meaningless.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.080]   - He doesn't like the term now.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.480]   People should listen to that whole thing though.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.320]   - Yeah, you can go through that.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.080]   - So, but if what he says is true,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.120]   in other words, it's always been cloud computing
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.360]   because as long as there's been a net,
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.720]   then why should anything change
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.840]   in so far as the paradigm of computing?
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.560]   In other words, why should we stop using packages
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.600]   for the desktop when they still function very well?
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.000]   - Well, all right, maybe they function well,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.040]   but I think Microsoft-
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:16.880]   - And they're more efficient.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.200]   - They're more efficient.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.000]   - Let's use money. - Let's use money.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.840]   The idea of money sitting on your desktop
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.720]   kind of ignores the fact that all the data
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.960]   that money's chewing on is out there.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   Why does money need to be on your desktop?
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.240]   Why not just have a personal website that's secure and safe?
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.560]   Of course, that might be a question mark,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.480]   but let's assume it's secure and safe.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.640]   - Big assumption. - You can't it.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.160]   Well, nothing's secure and safe even on your desktop,
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.240]   but I think you can make it as secure as your desktop.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.080]   Let's put it that way.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.200]   Maybe more secure considering
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.040]   how people treat their desktops.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.880]   And it's always updated, it's always available.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.200]   Most importantly, you've got a dashboard.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.040]   I've got the mint dashboard on my iPhone.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.920]   I can see exactly what's going on with my money here.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.440]   I can see it on any computer.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.560]   Because it's cloud computing, it's not tied to a machine.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.040]   Why should people don't back up?
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.400]   They're not always sitting at their computer
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.720]   less and less so, in fact.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.640]   I think more and more we wanna have this stuff
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.800]   wherever we are.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.120]   We don't wanna tie to a single CPU.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.680]   That's kind of an old-fashioned idea.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.520]   - I'm with John.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.360]   I wouldn't put my photos online.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.200]   They're sitting here in an external hard drive, absolutely.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.440]   And I would never, I did not go in and try mint.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.920]   I tried mint, I looked at it.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.920]   But I did not go with mint, no matter how easy it might be
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.600]   and accessible, it makes everything.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.320]   Because I'm concerned about the security.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.360]   - Well, I resisted it too.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.000]   I understand that completely.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.720]   And I did resist it for a year.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.560]   And I'm kicking myself now because I went to it in August.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.000]   Once you understand that the backend
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.160]   is the same backend your bank is using,
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.360]   what's the risk?
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.400]   I mean, your bank already,
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.040]   this Yodelie knows everything about you anyway.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.400]   Right?
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.840]   - Yeah, no, I'm just you sign up.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.000]   - No, this argument is not arguable.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.320]   The Leo argument that we're hearing right now,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.240]   because the fact of the matter,
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.320]   it reminds me, let me give you the anecdote
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.240]   that I'm always reminded of,
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.080]   which is the people that are fearful
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.880]   of putting their orders online for mail order.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.720]   Because the fact of the matter is-
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.640]   - But you'll give your credit card to a waiter
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.000]   who wanders off.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.840]   - No, actually that's the real irony is beyond that.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.280]   Is that fact of the matter is,
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.480]   'cause I've done direct marketing,
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.800]   is that nowadays if you want to set up
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.520]   a direct marketing 800 number,
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.000]   they bring up that exact same website
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.320]   because they won't take your order
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.640]   and they won't do the ordering for you
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.480]   unless you have a website
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.280]   that takes the orders over the internet.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.760]   And they just type in what the person was-
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.200]   - It's probably a prisoner typing an N.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.400]   (laughs)
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.440]   Seriously, I was using for a long time,
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.400]   I used an online bill pay service,
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.800]   and all my bills are scanned
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.600]   in this mysterious place in South Dakota.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.880]   Everything went to South Dakota.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.760]   And I couldn't figure out why South Dakota
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.040]   until I realized it was a federal penitentiary there.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.720]   They're paying prisoners 10 cents an hour
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.240]   to scan my bills in. - Okay, now.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.640]   So now my concern, again,
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.120]   let's get back to the actual topic at hand,
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.040]   is not so much about the cloud
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.480]   versus the non-cloud versus the security.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.320]   It's the efficiency, it sucks.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.200]   It's absolutely stinks.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.440]   Like I said, I go to PayPal,
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.820]   it takes forever to refresh a page.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.280]   I got a fast connection.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.960]   I'm doing some online writing or something.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.640]   It doesn't have half the power of Microsoft Word.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.440]   It's just too sluggish.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.360]   I don't like it.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.520]   I don't like uploading photos to these crazy websites.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.840]   It takes forever.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.960]   And then you have to do this,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.400]   and then they've failed to recognize the photo.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.040]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040]   I don't do not- - Hey, I understand
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.600]   they're bringing it out of PS3 Slim.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.920]   Who needs it?
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.160]   I understand they're gonna bring out a small Wii.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.320]   And it's gonna be called the Wii Wii.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.840]   - Yeah, it's the Tech Grouch!
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.680]   (laughs)
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.080]   - I'm sorry, John, I had to do that to you.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.120]   - I should have never mentioned the Tech Grouch,
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.760]   and I have to live with this guy.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.080]   - All right, well, you're the guy under 30 here.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.040]   What do you think?
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.000]   - Well, I have to say,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.200]   the thing about cloud computing for me is,
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.800]   you mentioned sort of having your photos on the web
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.560]   and don't necessarily trust your photos on the web
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.640]   and how you don't want to get them up there.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.680]   For me, like, I would have to say
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.160]   that photos are almost pointless if they're not on the web.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.000]   - That's what I think.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.320]   - Who's looking at them?
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.640]   - Who's looking at them?
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.000]   Your kids aren't looking at them.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   - But you don't have to keep them there.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   - You can have them both places.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.240]   - I shoot eight gigabytes a week, generally, of photos.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.760]   I'm not gonna be uploading that much, it takes too long.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.520]   - I upload every photo I care about.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.680]   But first of all, you shouldn't be saving eight gigabytes.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.680]   Yeah, so I pick the photos I want to save.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.640]   I upload them to SmugMug and Flickr.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.440]   They're there, they're protected, they're safe,
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.600]   they're online, if somebody wants them, they can see them.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.960]   I can link to them.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.000]   I share them with the world.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.160]   I think that that's a good model.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.040]   - But you still got them on Earth, right?
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.840]   - Yeah, but I mean, it--
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.120]   - Oh, erase them, Leo, erase them, you don't need them on Earth.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.680]   Just erase everything you got and leave it up in the cloud.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.640]   And then when your account is canceled,
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.320]   because somebody doesn't like the way you look.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.160]   - Oh, look, Flickr and SmugMug.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.160]   - And you can complain about it later.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.280]   - That's why I do Flickr and SmugMug.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.840]   And you're right, you should save a copy.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.000]   But come on, let's face it, how many people have
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.440]   a shoebox full of photos that, I mean, my wife,
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.160]   we've moved four times with 400 pounds of photos.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.720]   No one will ever look at.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.160]   - No one will ever look at those.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.200]   - Scan them in and upload them, Leo.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.880]   - Absolutely, look at them once and there are services
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.720]   that Scott Barnes talked about.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.880]   - Well, there you go, there you go.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.920]   - I just had that.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   And some guys in India took a look at--
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.160]   - You've proven my point.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.040]   You've proven my point.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.560]   That's the best way to deal with them.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.880]   Not that, I mean, you've got John
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.640]   an eight gigabyte a week shoebox
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.440]   that just happens to be a hard drive.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.560]   - If I want to look at it, I can plow through them.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.520]   Like, there's no tomorrow.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.480]   It's very difficult to do when they're online.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.840]   - It's too slow.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.840]   - That's true, no, you're right.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.480]   I use Lightroom on the drive to scan them.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.320]   Yeah, it's a look at them and see which I want.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.000]   So that's a good point.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.840]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.400]   This is so much fun.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.400]   You guys are great.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.680]   Now, Frank, it's Barnico.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.440]   - Yeah.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.360]   - I've been saying Barnico, Barnico.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.520]   - Yeah, so a lot of people, it's okay.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.360]   It's okay.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.040]   - Well, I had the last time I checked
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.960]   that 49ers are up 35 zipp.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.480]   - What?
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.120]   - See, that's what happens when Brett Favre
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.200]   doesn't play for every team in the NFL.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.960]   - I'm sorry, I apologize, Will, in advance.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.120]   How's the cricket going?
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.600]   - Nah.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.440]   Forget it.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.600]   - Ask me how the Redskins are going.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.000]   - Red skins, how are the skins?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.880]   No, the Niners lost their first game yesterday last week,
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   but just by a little bit,
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.400]   and I guess they're doing okay this week.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.240]   Kevin Rose was on the show and actually announced the score,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.080]   so this is two weeks running.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.920]   I'm personally of the opinion that people who listen to the show
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.400]   probably are not big football fans.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.760]   In fact, I probably don't even get out much.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.920]   - Huh?
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.760]   - You think?
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.120]   It's just a theory.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:00.960]   I could be willing.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.960]   - You don't get out much.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.640]   (laughing)
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.760]   - I was a 10-grouch!
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.120]   I love this character, dude.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.960]   This is such a great character.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.160]   - Beatles rock band, who the heck needs this crap?
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.360]   (laughing)
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.200]   - Yeah.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:41.880]   - It's you, it's finally, you finally found your metche
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.720]   com.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:50.920]   They have 60,000 at last count, 60,000 books on here.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.920]   Every category from business to fiction to nonfiction.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.600]   I just, I always feel like life,
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.800]   my life is moving so fast,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.000]   I just don't get enough time to read,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.400]   and Audible solves that for me.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.680]   They also, I really wanna recommend the website
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.680]   because it's a great place to go to browse.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.200]   You know, people often moan the loss of the bookstore,
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.400]   and I certainly love browsing bookstores,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.800]   but Audible's just like a bookstore.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.480]   It's kind of like an online bookstore where you go
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.880]   and you browse and you look,
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.280]   you say that sounds interesting?
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.080]   Some ways it's even better because you can listen
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.200]   to a sample of the book.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.320]   Here's Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.160]   (gasping)
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.200]   What a classic that is.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.800]   I didn't even know that they had an audio.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.280]   I only at Gould narrates this.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.440]   See, that's so cool.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.680]   I'm gonna make this my Audible pick,
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.760]   and I don't even know about this.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.040]   I'm looking for books to listen to.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.960]   I got a 15-hour flight coming up.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.880]   Many, many Audible books are classics.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.240]   This is unabridged.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.720]   Raymond Chandler's first novel from 1939
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.960]   introduces Philip Marlow to the world.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.240]   It was that great Humphrey Bogart-Laren Bekal movie.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.800]   It was kind of an inscrutable movie, I guess,
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.000]   because who wrote it in Faulkner,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.480]   I think wrote the screenplay for it.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.800]   Now we can figure it out.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.240]   But it's just a classic.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.200]   Ah, this is it.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.640]   This is my book pick of the week.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.600]   But you see how quickly you just browse through there
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.680]   and you find great stuff?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.640]   Now, let me tell you, you can get two books absolutely free.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.400]   Right now, by going to audible.com/twit2,
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.720]   sign up for that platinum account.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.600]   The first two books are free.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.320]   I grunted.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.600]   Elliot Gould reading up and asleep.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.480]   Riley, I said, "Doghouse Riley."
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.160]   That's a funny name.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.120]   She bit her lip and turned her head a little
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.360]   and looked at me along her eyes.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.520]   Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.160]   and slowly raised them again like a theater curtain.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.320]   "I was to get to know that trick
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.440]   that was supposed to make me roll over on my back
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.520]   with all four paws in the air.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.440]   Are you a prize fighter?"
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.280]   She asked when I was.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.200]   Oh, I could just see Lauren Bacall from that scene.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.000]   That's a great scene from the movie.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.560]   Raymond Chandler is the big sleep and another book.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.960]   You pick it.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:56.720]   Absolutely free.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.840]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.680]   We love audible.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.520]   We know you will.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.920]   You can play it back on almost any device,
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.440]   your Kindle, your Zoom, your iPod, your iPhone,
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.120]   even a lot of GPS devices.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.760]   Go to the device center right there on the Audible front page.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.720]   You can see a list of all the devices and all the manufacturers.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.640]   Figure it out if it works on your MP3 player.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.040]   I'm sure it does.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.800]   Start downloading books today from Audible,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:26.160]   your first two free at audible.com/twit.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.040]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.480]   You're still reading audio books?
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.400]   So Audible books, Will?
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.720]   Yeah, I have to say, I'm really
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.600]   been enjoying recently.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.800]   I've gotten into a little bit of a Tolkien kick.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.320]   Oh, how fun.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.440]   Because there's been a couple of new Tolkien books
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.600]   released over here.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.280]   But Audible has a fantastic-- a few of Tolkien's
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.760]   lesser-known works.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.080]   Far from the jars of ham, roverandum.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.560]   You know what's in the book with major?
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.280]   Only in Audible Britain, I think.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.520]   Audible UK.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.800]   No, no, I'm looking at it on the Audible US--
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.240]   Oh, good.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.160]   --7 because they're in dollars.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:03.600]   Oh, good.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.000]   Because we looked for the Lord of the Rings,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.080]   and you could get it, but we couldn't.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.080]   Yeah, so they've got some really good ones.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.960]   So Far from the jars of ham, roverandum,
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.040]   narrated by Derek Jacoby, who's a fantastic kind of Shakespearean
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040]   British actor.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.120]   And they're really, really fantastic, slightly less
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.240]   read Tolkien books.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.960]   But they're equally as good.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.200]   Are they good?
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.400]   Yeah, very, very good.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:27.880]   That's cool.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.640]   I'm going to have to try those.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   I'm a big fan of what?
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.240]   And they're making the movie The Hobbit.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.200]   Well, I can't wait to see how that turns out.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.480]   Is Jackson-- Peter Jackson's not directing that, though.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.720]   The guy who did The Other Lord of the Rings.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.680]   Yeah, so he's producing it, but it's
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.720]   being directed by Guillermo Del Toro.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.680]   That's right.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.840]   We talked about that the last time you were on, didn't we?
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.400]   I'm just talking geeky, it's sad.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:01.440]   Apple announces that there are 85,500 iPhone apps,
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.440]   2 billion downloads.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.840]   It's just remarkable.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:13.680]   What is it, an 85,400 of them a tip calculator?
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.040]   Hey, but you got your choice.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.280]   You got your choice.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.040]   And flashlights.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.280]   Palm has decided, I guess, to stop that shooting war with Apple.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.160]   Palm pre-remember would sync with iTunes,
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.040]   and Apple keeps updating iTunes so it doesn't work.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.000]   So Palm kept offering firmware.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.800]   Finally, they've given up and they say,
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.480]   I screw it.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.840]   They're going to let you download from Amazon anyway.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.880]   You know what?
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.720]   Oh, hey, but know the exact opposite because yesterday,
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.080]   there was a new firmware release for the pre-reenabled
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:41.480]   syncing.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.040]   Oh, man, I thought it was over.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:43.560]   Oh, no.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.520]   Depends when I read the--
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520]   That's back.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   That's hysterical.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.240]   It's back.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.200]   So now you get both.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.640]   You get iTunes and Amazon's MP3 store.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.400]   So I've never used the Amazon services.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.200]   What's the difference?
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.880]   Well, the thing about iTunes is it's encapsulated.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.160]   But I don't think iTunes is that good looking or easy to use.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:02.680]   I agree.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.040]   I think it's difficult to use.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.960]   It takes-- and every time, if I don't use it a lot,
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.720]   you say that you forget this screw,
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.360]   it's got a lot of--
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:08.880]   Screw it.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.480]   It's weird.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.320]   Screw it.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.440]   It's like a lot of programs that are older
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.640]   and have accreted a lot of silly UI cruft.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.800]   And so as a result, just no longer
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800]   makes sense, except to the people who have been there all
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.040]   along watching the cruft of cute cumulae.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.680]   So you go to amazon.com and you have to--
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.600]   you can't search at the beginning because you'll
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.280]   get CDs as well as MP3s.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.760]   You just go to the MP3 Downloads section.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.240]   And I think--
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.360]   I know a lot of iTunes fans who said, oh, this isn't as easy
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:37.720]   to use.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.440]   I think it's easier.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.000]   When iTunes was still copy protected, this wasn't.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.040]   It's a great way to search.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.480]   I was kind of--
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.400]   Well, it's easier because it's the Amazon vernacular, right?
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.880]   Everyone knows how to use Amazon.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.000]   And so it's just making that available through the same kind
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:55.320]   of channel.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.240]   What about distribution of pod casts?
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.240]   No, they don't do pod casts.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.240]   They don't do pod casts.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.160]   Yeah, they don't do pod casts.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.400]   And then that's always been a source spot for me.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.840]   Not that I'm not glad that iTunes came along and made it
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.880]   easier to get podcasts, but it's still so many clicks.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.000]   That's one of the reasons we started
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.160]   doing streaming videos so people just go to a website
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.480]   and they could see.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.120]   And I'm not going to be here next week
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.040]   because I'm going to Dubai.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.560]   But when we come back the week after,
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.960]   I'm going to Blog World.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.160]   That'll be October 16th.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.760]   And I'll talk then about a new platform we have
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.600]   for distributing our video because I just--
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.200]   Oh, so psyched for that, Lee.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:31.840]   So psyched.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.200]   I did not want to just put it on iTunes
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.600]   because I think we've plateaued.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.280]   And so I thought we've got to find a new way to make it--
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.920]   the whole thing is point of access.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.080]   It has to be you could sit down at your TV and do it.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.560]   What I've mentioned, we're going to do a deal with media flight.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.000]   They're going to put it on the Roku box, which is a great start.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.720]   You don't have that in Britain, though.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.280]   But do you have Yahoo TVs in the UK?
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.840]   Oh, these are the ones that have the new kind of widget stuff integrated.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.200]   I think a lot of manufacturers are going to build this into their new TVs.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.720]   This will also work on those TVs.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.480]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.040]   So the idea is that ultimately, it should be no more difficult to watch
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.760]   a channel flip show or a mee-veo show or a flip show on your TV
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.880]   than it is to watch NBC, CBS or ABC.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.480]   And once we get to that point, then I think podcasts can take off.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.880]   I just don't think they can take off in the ghetto of the iTunes store.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.440]   It just doesn't--
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.480]   Well, that's what's kicking off over here with the new BBC joint venture.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.160]   What's that?
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:31.920]   What's going on?
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.400]   Well, which is-- they've got this project where they're basically--
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.480]   I went to a meeting with the guys running it a couple of weeks ago--
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.720]   where they're basically building the next generation in Britain.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.480]   The primary way of getting TV isn't cable.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.440]   It's over the air.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.840]   So it's terrestrial.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.320]   And they're building the next gen terrestrial spec.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:54.800]   But it's actually replacing terrestrial with IPTV.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:03.520]   So they're basically creating an entirely British local standard for IPTV
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:09.880]   with the idea that it's as easy to build any notes, to get any third party content
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:15.000]   onto the TV as it is to get anything that's over-traditional broadcast.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.600]   And the model that they're using very explicitly
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.800]   is the iTunes App Store model, whereby--
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.040]   That's interesting.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.320]   So content providers like Channel Flip in the UK or two.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.720]   You'll buy an app that is Channel Flip.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.960]   Well, you'll make an app.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.560]   You basically make the equivalent of an app that can be browsed on the TV
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.880]   with its own kind of UE within a certain kind of--
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.800]   That's exactly what Mediafly's doing.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.520]   That's the way it has to be.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.160]   So there's going to be a Twit button on the Roku, or there'll be a Twit button on your Yahoo,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.440]   or there'll be a Channel Flip button on your Yahoo.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.000]   And that's interesting. The BBC is doing that as well.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.560]   Now, one of our chatter says he's in Ireland and does have a Yahoo TV.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.720]   So I guess those TVs are coming out worldwide.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.240]   But that's-- and Sony's making a TV that you plug your ethernet into.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.240]   I think that's really where we need to go.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.720]   It has to be that easy, where people are just not-- it's too much trouble to figure out.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.880]   I agree with you.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.160]   Thank you.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.240]   What do you think about that Beatles rock band?
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.240]   That's crap!
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240]   I hate it!
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240]   Crap!
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.040]   What did you say?
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.840]   Who needs that?
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:24.240]   Learn how to play the-- learn the real guitar, not the fake guitar.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.440]   Yeah, that's-- I agree with you, TechRabs.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.440]   There you have it.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.640]   I think you're absolutely right. That fake guitar, that's crap.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.840]   And it's going to be called the Wii-Wii.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.640]   Beatles rock band, who the heck needs this crap?
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.640]   Yeah!
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.920]   We're going to do a few more of those next week.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.080]   I want you to do a ton of them.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.880]   I guess it's not probably very hard, right?
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.360]   You could probably write that stuff in your sleeve.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   He is grip about everything.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   Yeah, hey!
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360]   So what else is new?
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.360]   How hard could it be?
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.960]   He's not a lot of effort that's going into that, right?
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.600]   He's-- no, wait a minute.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.720]   Now, let's not diminish.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.320]   You see, it's easy, because John makes it look so easy, but John's had to live a lifetime
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.880]   of disappointment, frustration, and horror to get to the point where he could make this
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.880]   kind of a thing.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:16.400]   I may have twisted earlier in the show, but is the TechRouch a 30-second spot that's
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.400]   going to play on websites, or is it a feature on MeVio that they-- where we're expected
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.240]   to come in, like a podcast, check on it every day?
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.400]   That's a good question.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.400]   We have no idea.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.400]   It's tough!
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.240]   Hey, you kids, go learn to play the guitar like I did.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.400]   Well, John, you said this is your future, didn't you?
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.200]   It is, sadly enough.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.120]   This is what it's come down to.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.840]   And I don't like adverbs.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.240]   So, hey, I have a request, by the way.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.240]   Yes, sir.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.240]   Mr. Devorak.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.240]   You know, I was thinking about this as I ran it.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.400]   I was editing a piece, somebody did, had a bunch of pops in it.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:55.360]   And, of course, I use one of these major screens to prevent that a little bit.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.200]   And I was thinking, wouldn't it be cool that-- you know the way they do a red eye and a
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   photo thing?
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200]   Yes.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.360]   You know, they pop and go around the eyeball, push the button.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   Boom.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:08.200]   So why can't you take an-- make an audacity plug-in that essentially highlights the pop
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.400]   area and then it renormalizes the waveform so the pop goes away?
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.800]   That's a great idea.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   I don't know.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.080]   I'm soliciting that from someone.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.840]   You know who might be able to do that for us?
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.160]   Our friend Doug Kay, who did the level later, at IT conversations, he might be able to do
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.720]   with the pop-a-later.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:26.720]   The pop-a-later?
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.400]   That would be it.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:33.360]   We have-- if you use Audition, actually, and I think other programs do this too, there's
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.240]   besides the wave view, there's this beautiful Tony uses.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.800]   I don't know exactly how it works, but it's like a spectrogram view.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.680]   And you can see stuff that's different.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.920]   And I think you could see pops and just-- you just like paint over it.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:51.960]   It's like a heel brush just like on Photoshop, but it's an audio heel brush.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.280]   It's really cool.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280]   I mean--
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280]   It's on what?
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.400]   --Audition, which is a software we were using.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   Actually, we're abandoning it now.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:04.200]   We're going to do Final Cut for all the audio and video editing as we move to video.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.720]   So the RIA-- this is so sad.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:13.000]   Sammy Thomas, Joel Tenenbaum, they fought the RIA.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.400]   They fought the record in history.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:19.520]   They ended up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.520]   Maybe they should have just ignored them.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.160]   The Judge Nancy Gertner in the federal court in Massachusetts has issued four default judgments
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:31.080]   against people who were accused by the recording industry of peer-to-peer file sharing.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.120]   They never bothered to answer the charges.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.200]   So you'd think, well, hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:42.120]   Yeah, now she gave them the minimum $750 a song, a few thousand bucks.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.680]   They walk.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:52.400]   So the damage is if you go to jury, Sammy Thomas' damage is $80,000 a song.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:25:00.240]   Joel Tenenbaum's damage is $22,500 a song, ignoring the lawsuit and $750.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.920]   You're basically encouraging what's essentially racketeering.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.000]   What kind of-- is this justice?
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   I don't know.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.240]   It's racketeering is what it is.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.120]   They should throw these people in jail.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.960]   For filing these suits, the RIA.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.600]   Well, I mean, it's just obviously let's file a suit here, file a suit there.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.320]   Just file them all over the place, whether you download it or not, and then you'll just
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:25.400]   give us the money or you're going to have to pay at least $40,000 to take it to court.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.400]   Here's a surprise.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.120]   Two-thirds of Americans object to online tracking.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.240]   Why do they even do a poll for that?
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.960]   And the number rises once they learn a different way is marketers are following their online
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   movements.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.120]   University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Berkeley professors doing a survey,
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:52.480]   a study of marketers and how people view marketing.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.240]   They ask things like, "Please tell me whether or not you want websites you visit to give
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.320]   you discounts that are tailored to your interests."
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.120]   That's what Google and Facebook do, right?
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.800]   66% said, "No, we don't want Taylor dads."
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   See, this is wrong.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.440]   They don't know they want Taylor dads.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.360]   I think they know they don't want them.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.640]   Wouldn't you wait a minute.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.480]   Wouldn't you prefer...
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.520]   This was my contention earlier on in the show.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.760]   Yeah, this is your contention.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.080]   Wouldn't you prefer if you go to a website that they add, I guess the problem is they
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.480]   feel like they're being spied on, but if you could set aside the spine, wouldn't you
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.480]   rather see ads?
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480]   I know we know this on TV.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.520]   You'd rather see an ad for something you're interested in than for something you're not
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.520]   interested in.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.560]   I don't care to see feminine hygiene spray ads on television because I just don't have
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.280]   that problem.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.240]   I don't like seeing ads.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.240]   At all.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   Well, yeah.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240]   And the question, was that the question?
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.080]   Was it ads tailored to me or no ads?
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.640]   I bet it was the former and not the later.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.680]   And so I'd rather not see any ads at all, period.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.680]   Well, sorry.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.720]   But I was just a ads tailored to me.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.720]   I mean, yeah, I understand.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.520]   I don't want to see ads, but come on.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.720]   I mean, you also, you know, I also want.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.320]   I don't care if it's tailored to me or not.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.320]   I'm not going to pay any attention.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.320]   I don't like ads.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.840]   Well, then what do we do to monetize?
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.840]   How do you monetize the tech for money?
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.280]   How do you monetize the tech grouch?
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.520]   We're using a square space thing that's tailor made for the people who watch the tech
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.320]   grouch grouch.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.720]   So they get a targeted ad for people who are only interested in this sort of thing.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.720]   I don't know.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.320]   I mean, it's just like, you know, there's nothing else you can do.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.640]   You've seen ZZ Top, haven't you?
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.960]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.520]   Use the code word tech for 12% discount.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.680]   You get a better discount than we do.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.680]   We only get 10%.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.680]   Oh, stop.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.680]   Is there more?
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.680]   This is a feature.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.680]   No, it just repeats.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.680]   Oh, that's good.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.680]   It just flicks over and over.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.680]   It's a feature.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   It's a feature.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.680]   It's a business model.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   I'm friends with the CEO.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.680]   Google.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.400]   Oh, with Squarespace, your friends?
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400]   I thought I was.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.400]   That's a very nice little smug look.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400]   I thought I was.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   That's a bigger discount.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400]   All right.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   That's OK.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.800]   It comes out of my pocket.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.160]   I actually give back to the community.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.600]   Oh, I get it.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.600]   The 2% comes from you.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.400]   Hey, what was I going to say?
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   Oh, wave.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.760]   Google Wave came out.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760]   We talked a lot about it.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.280]   If you're really interested in this on the This Week in Google show, that's the Google
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.680]   fanboy show.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.760]   This isn't, I think, probably somewhat less than a Google fanboy show.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.800]   You know, your show is rated number one and by some podcast, Nutball.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.440]   Nutball was number one on iTunes.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.040]   Well, besides that, it's a very, very popular show.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.040]   Why?
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.680]   Because Google is taking over the world and everybody wants to know when it's coming.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]   I have never heard this show.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.680]   I'm going to have to listen to it.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.280]   You know, it's Jeff Jarvis, who's great.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280]   It's Gina Trapani.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280]   And then we bring in a fourth.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.960]   I'd love to have you on it anytime you want.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.520]   And we bring in a fourth person who's an expert in some area.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.200]   Yesterday was Marshall Kirkpatrick from Read, Write Web.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:04.120]   And Kevin Marks of British Telecom, who's the guy who started, you know, created Quick
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.800]   Time and used to work at Google.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.760]   So he's very Google-up and social.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760]   So he's very--
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.520]   Are you marginalizing this show, the big show?
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.600]   Yeah, this show is dead.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.600]   It's history.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.200]   You know, the last time I say that--
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.680]   Oh, it was very, very--
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.600]   No, no, I'm not marginalizing this show.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.600]   Are you kidding?
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.840]   I'm trying to expand so that I can be a multimillionaire.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:29.960]   It's hey, you know, it's expensive.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:30.960]   Servants.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.960]   Do you know how much--
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.480]   A good butler is expensive and hard to find.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.560]   It's very expensive.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.240]   A hubcap on a Bentley.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.560]   You know how much that costs?
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.840]   It is not easy to live in Northern California.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.040]   The pool boy raised the cost of, you know--
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.040]   Raul?
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040]   Raul.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.400]   20% more, he says, because we have four pools.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.840]   I don't think that that's fair.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.280]   I think it's by hour.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.080]   It doesn't matter how many pools you have.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.920]   The hourly rate should be the same if it takes them.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:00.960]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.760]   OK, I'm just saying.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.280]   Well, I feel for you.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.520]   And have you seen the cost at jet fuel?
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.120]   So what is the show Google about?
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:10.880]   It's about Google.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.800]   But let me ask you about Wave.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.520]   What do you think?
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.680]   Now that we've all seen it, right?
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.400]   No, I haven't seen it.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.160]   No, I never got my invite.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.120]   I never got it running.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.000]   I've never seen Wave.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.720]   Only you've got an invite.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.640]   All right, I'm going to invite you guys.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.560]   I'll send you invites.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.560]   I have three left just in time for you.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.280]   How about you?
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.240]   Well, have you seen it?
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.240]   Yeah, but here's the thing, Leo.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.000]   You can send out the invites, but they're not going out.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.240]   No, they're nominations.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:34.960]   They're not invites.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.080]   They're nominations.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.040]   Yeah, they're all just kind of stuck
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.520]   in some kind of big Google log jam.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.960]   Because I've had people who have sent me a few,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.480]   and I haven't had any of them.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.760]   Well, Leo, tell us all about it.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.160]   Yeah, what do you think of it?
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.560]   You've been inside.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.480]   I encourage you to check out our Twig Show,
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.640]   because we did spend an hour talking about it.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.040]   You know, Scoble said, what is it?
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.200]   You know, he finally got in and said,
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:02.240]   this is like incomprehensible mishmash of stuff.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.840]   It's like chat out of control.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.320]   And I think your first reaction is, this is kind of crazy.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.360]   But I'm going to withhold judgment,
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.200]   because I think in time--
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.800]   What's it supposed to be?
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.200]   Well, they miss-- I think they misrepresented it.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:19.520]   The Rasmussen Brothers, when they created it,
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.720]   said we want to rethink email.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:26.120]   Email was invented, you know, 30 years ago.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.320]   How people communicate is different.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.600]   And I think that people thought, oh, this is going to be
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.240]   the next email, and it's not.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.680]   It's really for, I think, it's a collaborative tool.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.000]   It doesn't even have a public face.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.440]   It's a collaborative tool.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.920]   So if we were, for instance, planning the show,
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.520]   which we've never done, but say we wanted to,
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.360]   we would get together in a Google wave,
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.000]   and we'd type up ideas, we'd put pace in articles and video,
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.920]   and so forth.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.880]   And we could collaborate and make a permanent document that
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.000]   is a record of the collaboration, including all edits.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.160]   It's kind of wick-y like, you can edit what I wrote,
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.400]   I can edit what you wrote.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.480]   There's a playback so you can go back to the beginning
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.440]   and walk through the changes.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.480]   I think it's an interesting tool for that.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.520]   I think what's going to make it or break it
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.960]   is what third-party developers do for it.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.320]   It's got a real API.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.360]   There are a number of bots and extensions and gadgets
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.600]   for it already.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.800]   And I think that that could really tell us what it could be.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:19.840]   I think we don't know.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.520]   Just as we didn't really know what Twitter was going to be
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.800]   until people got to it and started using it,
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.600]   and they really used it in ways that were different
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.200]   from what Twitter thought they would be.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.960]   I think we will see Wave develop as its users use it.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.760]   I think it's very innovative and very interesting.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.160]   I think that has a lot of potential.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.000]   - Sounds like something.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.360]   Is it a different for graphical documents?
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.240]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.240]   It's much more real time.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.720]   And this is what it really is, is playing off of this
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.560]   real fervor for real-time web.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.400]   Everything happens right now.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.080]   It's collaborative and is in the real time.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.360]   And I guess that's the question.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:00.160]   Much as cloud computing new.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.000]   No, we've been doing it.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   Real time's not new.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.560]   I mean, we've been doing real time on radio and TV for years.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.760]   Anything live is real time.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:11.520]   But the web has not had that until recently.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.840]   And now thanks to more modern web technologies and Ajax
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:18.160]   and things like the XMPP, it can be real time.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.120]   And I think that is kind of an interesting use of the web.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:20.960]   I'm excited about it.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.720]   We do a lot of real-time stuff here.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.200]   I have chat rooms going while we're doing the show.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.000]   We have a friend feed room that's going while we're doing
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]   the show and I think it's very valuable.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.560]   We've had 108 comments in our friend feed conversation
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.800]   as we've been talking.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:38.840]   Johnny Worthington says Wave is inter-office email.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.920]   That may be actually a more apt description of it, really.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:46.680]   - I remember the day when inter-office email used to come
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.680]   in a big manila on- - Yes!
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.400]   - And there was a bunch of names on it.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.320]   And when you wrote the name, you read it
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.000]   and then you extra name off and sent it to the next person.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.880]   - I bet you were a hoarder.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.480]   Did you hoard those envelopes?
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.280]   - No, I didn't.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.640]   Well, maybe.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.000]   - I did.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:03.920]   They were very useful.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.320]   Oh yeah, you could store stuff in them.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.360]   - Well, they're handy envelopes.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.920]   And there's also a good way to route stuff.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:08.760]   - It is.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.360]   And you remember they had air holes in them
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.320]   so they were really good for storing small animals.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.840]   - They did have air holes for some unknown reason.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.440]   - Nobody understands why they had air holes.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.280]   - So you can see.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.000]   - You know what's really good for keeping stuff now also?
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:21.840]   - Which?
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.680]   - They had ex envelopes.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.080]   - They're very, very sturdy.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:26.920]   - They're tough.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:27.760]   - Yeah.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.600]   - The Tyvek.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.440]   - And they're free.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.280]   - Are they Tyvek?
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.480]   - They seem like they're Tyvek.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.320]   - Yeah, they're Tyvek.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.200]   They're very, try to turn one.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.560]   - Yeah, no, you can't.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.400]   - I've shown them into jackets
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.920]   and so you work and wear them.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.480]   - It's not, Tyvek is not the same thing
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.320]   as bullet proof material, right?
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.560]   That's something else.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.400]   - That's Kevlar.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.720]   - The Horax beard is made out of Tyvek.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.920]   - Yeah, I think that beard is definitely nothing natural.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.000]   Let's put it that way.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.560]   It was never anybody's actual hair.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.880]   John C. de Vorak is at channeldevorak.com
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.600]   and check out his new Tech Grout show
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.480]   which I think we've plugged more than enough.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:07.080]   - I didn't mean to even plug it at all.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.200]   - I'm glad you did.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.040]   It's great.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.080]   You could catch him there
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.880]   and we thank you so much for being here, John.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.200]   And boy, that camera's looking good
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.760]   for people who wanna see John
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.240]   in his incredible sartorial ex.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.840]   - Who, I gotta put dye my hair on some.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.680]   I'm too blonde.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:21.520]   - Where'd you get that?
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.400]   - Yeah, you're too blonde, John.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.280]   Where'd you get that shirt?
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.840]   That's just wild.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.880]   - Taiwan.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.040]   - Oh, it looks something like carnivol left over from Rio.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.800]   - I, but believe it or not,
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.480]   I bought this shirt about almost 20 years ago in Taipei.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.080]   I've never worn it
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.680]   because I just saw the fabric.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.400]   I said, that would make a great custom shirt.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.680]   I bought it at the Lylai Sheraton's Taylor Shop.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.680]   And I've spent it in the closet forever
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.960]   and every time I put it on
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.680]   and then think I'm gonna go outside with it,
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   I put it back.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.480]   - I can't wear it.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.480]   It's like possible.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.960]   - Mimi says not with me,
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.760]   you're not wearing that shirt.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.680]   - So I figured this is where the shirt is.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.360]   - It's perfect for this show.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.480]   And you know, when you look at it on Skypeasaurus,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.800]   which is our special four screen Skype display,
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.720]   you just stand out.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.160]   You pop, it really pops.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.000]   It's fantastic.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.440]   If you haven't seen the show, we do it live.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.880]   And I think I could say safely,
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.040]   we perform it live every Sunday afternoon
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.040]   at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.880]   And we'd love you to watch live
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.280]   and participate in the chat rooms
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.720]   or the friend feed room at live.twit.tv.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:25.680]   Live.twit.tv.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.960]   And thank you, John, for being here.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.520]   Frank, I really wanna thank you for being here.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.560]   And we're gonna have you on a lot more.
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.840]   - Thank you.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:34.160]   - Frank Barnico.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.680]   - Got it right.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.600]   - Just call me Frank.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.520]   - Frank.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.840]   Frank is at Barnico.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.680]   - Frankie B.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:40.680]   - Frankie B is here.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.680]   He's at Barnico.com.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.800]   He has immense experience in this business,
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.720]   including USA Today.com, CBS Market Watch.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.360]   He started the internet daily column
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.160]   for Market Watch back in 1998.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:54.840]   And we're gonna have you back real soon.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.200]   And of course, Will Harris is always welcome
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.800]   to darken our door anytime at channelflip.com.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.720]   And anything else you wanna plug?
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.120]   You've been doing a great job with Bobby Lewis.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.480]   - Twitter, Will Harris.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.320]   - Oh yeah.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.160]   - Will Harris on Twitter.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.080]   - You'd like to plug that Twitter, don't you?
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.560]   - I do, it's just the,
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.520]   you know, I'm an immensely vain person.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.680]   - Really, that's what Twitter is good for, you know?
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.520]   - Yeah.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.360]   - Yeah.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.400]   Just like kind of flogging your personal brain.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.240]   - Pretty much.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.960]   - But also makes a fantastic crowdsourcing resource.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.120]   - Yeah.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.480]   Yeah, it does, you know, it's really good.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.680]   In fact, that's what John's always said.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.640]   That's really good for asking a question
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.600]   and getting an answer.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.800]   And he's gonna--
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.320]   - Yeah, how many days will you be on the ground in Dubai?
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.760]   - I'm gonna be there, we fly out Tuesday.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.680]   And that means we arrive Wednesday evening.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.600]   So I'll be there Wednesday evening, Thursday, Friday.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.800]   Saturday I speak, the TEDx Dubai is at the Palladium
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.160]   in Dubai at the media city on Saturday.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:01.160]   It's a 15 hour flight each way for 18 minutes speech.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.240]   Saturday and Sunday I'm gonna do the radio show from there,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.960]   which is gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.520]   And then we fly back on Monday.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.560]   So I get a good five, six days there.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.120]   Have you been there Frank?
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.480]   - I have not, but it is the one place I would like to go.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.440]   We were talking about a wedding anniversary trip
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.920]   and I suggested that and my wife said no.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:19.760]   - Oh!
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.480]   - But I hope you take a lot of photographs.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.960]   - I'm gonna live blog, photograph,
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.920]   I'm gonna do the usual crazy media thing
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.320]   that I did last summer in China.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.600]   And the iPhone is really a great platform
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.200]   for kind of blogging a trip.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.960]   You can just do the whole thing.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.040]   And so I hope I don't have the same AT&T bill
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.000]   that I had from China, but I will do that.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.120]   And I will fill you in and maybe I can convince your wife
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:44.960]   it's worth going.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.560]   My wife's very excited.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.560]   She's gonna take a water taxi to the Suks and buy gold.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.880]   I'm told.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.040]   - You better go with the local.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.360]   - Yeah, oh yeah, 'cause I can't.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360]   I don't know how to do that stuff.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.200]   - Yeah, they'll rip you off.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.320]   I mean, the gold thing is cool because they actually,
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.600]   we'll sell you these elaborate gold chains
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.720]   and they weigh it and then they see what the current market
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.200]   price for gold is and you buy it at that price.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.800]   - Plus 100% or no?
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.360]   - No, no, no markup.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.040]   - So they, wow.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.040]   Well, so then I don't have to haggle there.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.160]   - No, but they're still, apparently they do say,
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.480]   pull some tricks on you if you don't know what you're doing.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.880]   - Like the old thumb on the scale trick.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.120]   - Something like that.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.440]   - Wow, that gold chain weighs 12 pounds.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:31.920]   - There's an area to buy that every shop is a gold shop.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.240]   - That's where I wanna go, the gold suit.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.600]   - It's blinding.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.080]   - I can't wait, I'm so excited.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.480]   - And go with the local.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.320]   - No, we will.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.800]   Actually, what's great is I'm being,
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.320]   I mean, these,
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.400]   at Georgia and the people there are just being great
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.480]   and they're gonna take us everywhere.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:48.320]   We're gonna go out in the desert.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.640]   I wanna shoot some,
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.880]   I do some photography out in the dunes.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.800]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.640]   So I'll report that.
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.040]   - The entire town is the desert,
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.200]   but go ahead, you know,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.240]   think what you want.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.080]   (laughing)
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.080]   - Formable.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.800]   - Next week we will still do a twit,
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.720]   but it will be Brian Brushwood and Mollywood.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.960]   We call it Schwood and Wood,
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.480]   and that will be at the same time.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.240]   And I'm sure they'll have a blast.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.760]   All the other shows will continue on
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.680]   with Alex Lindsey guest hosting for me,
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.800]   and I will be back, I guess Tuesday,
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.920]   where Mac break weekly.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.520]   That's a week from Tuesday.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.440]   But do follow my,
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.960]   I guess the best place to go probably would be
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.280]   follow my friend feed account
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.440]   because that will pull in links from Facebook,
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.440]   from my blog, from my Twitter, from everywhere else that I post.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.880]   That's friendfeed.com/leoloport.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.040]   Frank, are you on Twitter?
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.040]   You wanna plug your Twitter account?
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.160]   - Frank Barnacow is the Twitter account.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.840]   - Easy enough, B-A-R-N-A-K-O.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.120]   - And the real Devorac.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.840]   - Of course, what else would it be?
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.040]   Well, it could be real Devorac if you're David Pogue.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.960]   Did he ever apologize to you?
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.120]   - Yeah, he sent me a note,
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.440]   but he never, you know,
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.120]   he sent me a tweet, a tweet.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:52.960]   (laughing)
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:53.800]   - He tweeted you.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.960]   At least he tweeted the writer,
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:57.760]   David was complaining that John was ripping him on Twitter
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.920]   and it turns out it wasn't John,
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.960]   it was somebody pretending to be John.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.680]   Dune surfing, they say I can go dune surfing,
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.600]   that'll be fun.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.120]   Hey, thanks guys, really appreciate your time.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.680]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.200]   Eastmeets West is coming up next.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.680]   I'm Leo LaPorte, another tweet.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.240]   - This is amazing.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.080]   - Is it the camp?
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:19.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.520]   - Round the board.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:33.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:39.120]   (upbeat music)
