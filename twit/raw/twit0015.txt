[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 15 for July 26th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Now, uh, Gizmo's working too. I mean, I'm, uh, I'm able to talk to John, although...
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I don't know how good... 'Cause my first talk with the quality is 'cause John's microphone is so lousy.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I think we ought to all pitch in on some headphones, you know, I certainly go...
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Good, John, a headset.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Where is he? Is he there? Hello, John.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I think he wandered off. I know we're still on 'cause I hear the echo coming from him, but...
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   There he is. I'm over here!
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   You know, if you guys ever want to start the show, let me know.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   We're starting! This is the show!
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   This is the...
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   This is why John doesn't use a headset. He uses speakers.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   He doesn't want to hear it.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And listen to the...
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Yeah, but...
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Yeah, you need one of those ones that the DJs use where you wander around.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   You know, that's actually what we're using.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Me and Tom Lycus.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Yeah, Lycus uses that.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Did you use... Did you use... Were you like a regular on Lycus's show?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I've been on his show. The old show.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   But he was in LA.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   He had to dump me. I said something... A bad word, and he had to dump me.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Well, those days are over. He probably want you to say bad words on his new show.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Now he's like a woman hater. What is he now? He just hates women.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   He's got this new persona, which is hilarious, because when he was doing his other show,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   he was like this liberal kind of beyond you liberal.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yeah, he was touchy-feely, yeah.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Now he's a kind of a right-wing woman hater, and it's just like obviously, I mean, this guy's just whatever the money is.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Well, that's pretty much the way we're...
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   You know, as a beyond, I can't really hold it against him.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The only thing I didn't like about Tom Lycus is he always talked like a DJ.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Don't like his show. Does he still do that?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Not as much. Not too bad extreme.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   We call that a puker.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I don't even know who this guy is.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Robert Aaron is the biggest fan. He talks about a non-stop.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Robert's a little bit of a misogynist, I think.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   A little bit.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Yeah. Yeah. We could talk about him, because he's not here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That's cool.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He's in Cabo San Lucas. We should tell everybody. He's in Cabo San Lucas.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Patrick is in Florida. He west.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He's not in the west.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Oh, he's not in Baja for the first time. He's in somewhere with water.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He's in Baja.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Kevin Rose is some... Key West. I don't know if it's exactly Key West.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I know what you're thinking, John. Kevin Rose is stranded on the fighting.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I know exactly what you're thinking. He's next to the agenda. Fire island is...
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Ahh.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It was right. He was exactly what he was...
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   For some reason, Google Earth has horrible resolution of Key West.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It'll take a while. Don't do it now while you're talking to me.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   You'll kill your bandwidth, dude. I'm not doing it now.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   All right. I just remember...
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Because they're not allowed to have any... What were you looking for?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Beach pictures? I was just looking for... I don't know.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's, you know, Google Earth. It's a monumental waste of time.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He's somewhere. He's having conch-freeta somewhere.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   But meanwhile, let me introduce the panel, because it's kind of an unusual panel today,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   but I'm thrilled we got them all. We brought you to Chang as in the studio with me.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   That's cool. I'm considered unusual.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You're... No, but it's unusual that you're sitting here.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I haven't seen you in the flesh since January.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   In the flesh, yeah.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Well, it's a little hot in the room.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   John C. de Vorak via Gizmo. This is the first time we've used Gizmo.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I don't think we're going to blame Gizmo for the sound quality this time.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   We're going to blame the Plantronics headset that John has had in the bottom of his closet.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   The bolt does get your own.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You found it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But hey, we can hear you, John, and it works, and Skype never did.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's good.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Also with us, David Prager.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Still waiting to get arrested for stealing the neighbor's Wi-Fi.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Are you still on somebody else's internet?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Well, it's a great signal, great bandwidth, and I...
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And he's moving anyway, so why should he start up a new account?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Even after that guy got busted in Florida for this, you're still willing to take a chance, huh?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yeah, but he's on a stay without me and without a bus.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   A few million others, probably.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And, well, I'll tell you who's unusual, because everybody else has been here before,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   but we've never had this fellow, and I'm really pleased to have him.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Gibson is joining us, the man behind Shields Up, GRC.com's spin right,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   former info world columnist, and just an all-round great guy, and it's...
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   John and I did the column side by side for years and years.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's really where John, where I first heard it, John, was the back of info world.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Was it inside track, a classic?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yep.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   What a great column. Both of your columns.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I used to read religiously back when I was just a...
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Kid.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Little kid.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   No. Let us get to the news of the week.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Oh, I got one.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Mr. Roger Chang, late together.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Rockstar's game...
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Hot Coffee?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   No, San Andreas?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Yeah, but the Hot Coffee mod.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Yes.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So, that was kind of big, because I actually heard about that through an insider.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You didn't listen to our show last week, did you?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   No, because I was in San Diego at the time.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So, we talked a little bit about it, but there is news, which is that Rockstar...
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The ESRB renamed or said it's now mature only, M.O. instead of...
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And they pulled the A.O.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   ...and they pounded the topic.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Well, but here's the deal.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's going to cost Rockstar $50 million they estimate in the next quarter,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   because it's an adults-only title.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Can you believe...
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And they'll lose that much sales?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They say they'll lose 50, because they have to pull...
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Many stores won't sell it.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Wow.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But then you just kind of wonder, were they disingenuous?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Were they hoped that people would find it and not expect...
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   They didn't expect a rating change?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   What happened?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I mean, it seems to me that they...
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Surely they didn't expect this outcome.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Other big...
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Other big story.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I think it's huge.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, clear, confident, connected.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Bring clarity to your world.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   No, I'm not talking about Twit 15.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I'm talking about the new Windows Vista.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Oh, it's a little Vista.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's...
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   By the way, I thought they made a last minute change.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's going to be called Hosta-a-Windows Vista.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Aww.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Baby.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Aren't they being sued already by...
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Somebody told me that they were being sued already.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I don't know who...
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Who the name?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Well, there's a number of VISTAs in the computer biz.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   There's Vista Print.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   There's a Vista...
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It should have just went with something like...
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   What?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Are they going to call it...
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Is it going to be all the name?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Is it going to say...
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Windows Vista on the box or is it just...
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   That's just another code name.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   No, that's the name.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It doesn't sound like a actual renaming of Longhorn.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   There's Vista.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Windows Vista.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Vista.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It actually sounds like a desktop app that you...
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You know, it's an RSS...
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's probably what it is.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Isn't that...
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And what's funny as with everything, a few years from now,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   we'll be talking about it like it's just called Vista forever.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Right.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Well, remember we called the...
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It's just like XP.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   We were calling 95 Chicago until they came out with 95.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Cool.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   How long ago did development begin on Longhorn,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   aka Vista now, about four years ago or so?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Five, isn't it?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Yeah, in fact, that was supposed to have an object-oriented file system beginning.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That was like a decade ago.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   WinFS.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   RIP.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   You know, and then remember we heard some...
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It was like going to be some 3D thing.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   So completely different UI where it was like totally immersive 3D.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   That all went away.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Well, they still have that technology is built in.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I mean, I've seen videos, but I don't know how important that's going to be.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I don't know if that's going to be the user interface or just the capability.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   What do they call that?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Some other lame code name.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   How about this?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Microsoft came out on Thursday, the US Patent and Trade office says that Microsoft's
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   trying to patent the smiley face.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   They're trying to...
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I thought they belonged to AOL.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   No, but here's the patent.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It covers, quote, "selecting pixels to create an emoticon image...
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Oh, tell us you're kidding.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   ...assigning a character sequence to these pixels and reconstructing the emoticon after transmission."
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That's exactly what Mark Taylor from the open source consortium said.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   He said, "This sounds like a... the kind of prank patent you might see some immature kid put up on slash dot."
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But it's not.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It's real.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yeah, it's not going to fly.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You trust the PTO to get this right.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It doesn't make any difference.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It just won't last a minute.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's just goofy.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Is it a lame?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I think somebody's pulling the rule over somebody's eyes at Microsoft that they think, you know,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I mean, this is just going to leave the company up until ridicule.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Well, let's ridicule them.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Definitely.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   They're doing all right.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They're doing all right.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Profits up 37 percent this quarter on strong PC sales.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But that kind of looks weak compared to Google.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Do you see what Google's profits were?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   No.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   What?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   400 percent jump.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Gee.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   From last year this time, they earned $342 million in three months.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   What's the bulk of their...
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   What are they doing?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   What's the stock valuation doing?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   John, you had a new target price?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Yeah, $500.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's $250.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's going to make it.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You ever want to laugh at me when I say it for this whole evidence that it's going to stop going up?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Wow.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I thought your discussion last week about the notion that Microsoft was sort of stalling out in general.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I think Microsoft's dead.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You know, the other thing is once the Mac OS comes over to the side, X86 side, which is going to do and become just a dominant operation.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's my thing, Microsoft got nothing but problems.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I think the whole world's going to be divided up to Microsoft doing apps to Office Suite.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   The operating system's going to be the Mac OS, Mac OS, then Linux is going to be the server operating system and they're just going to have to live with it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And where does Google fit in all this?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I think Google's going to be like, you know, the property in app company.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I mean, they're going to be the search engine company, at least for now.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Isn't that the killer app though?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I mean, that's the app, right?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Yeah, it's a...
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   You know, but I don't see them moving.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   They're not going to do anything about the server software.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   They're not going to do anything about the Office software.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And they're not going to do an operating system, even though they have Google OS.com registered.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I don't think they're really going to manage it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   This week, a lot of privacy advocates brought up the issue that Google's database contains now so much information about all of us that they present the biggest privacy threat of all.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Well, and remember when they were... what was the short-lived thing Google did a couple of months ago where they were proxying all of our...
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Anyone who did it?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Yeah, Google cache.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Google cache.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And, you know, it was beginning to screw things up and people were finding themselves logged in as other people.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Yeah, so, I mean, a single misstep, unfortunately they pulled that off within 24 hours.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Right.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   They have so much power, a misstep on their side could really have some impact.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Well, you know, with the reputation that Apple has so carefully built for the Mac over the years, I mean, if in fact it was ever possible, as John suggests, to buy, you know, OS, Mac OS something, I mean, at retail, at fries, in a box, and it ran on standard PC hardware, I mean, who, especially now with all the multi-boo,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   stuff we have, I mean, who wouldn't get one to screw around with it and, you know, end up maybe migrating?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   But is Apple ever going to let that happen, Steve?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   You know, on one hand you say, okay, they're a hardware seller, and so they don't want to, you know, offering their premium OS on Intel platforms to see, would clearly destroy their hardware.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   But, you know, look at the price pressure they must be under in order to sell this stuff against the commodity PC market, and you know, jobs has got to look around and see who the richest man in the world is, and that, you know, he's in the software business, not in the hardware business.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Well, what do you say to that?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I mean, it's true that Microsoft looks a lot healthier being in the, not worrying about the slim margins in the PC world.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Yeah, well, and you've got to know too that the idea of the Mac OS hosted on the standard commodity PC platform has to keep them bill gates up at night.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I mean, yeah, I would be...
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And how does he stop it?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And how does he stop it?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I mean, you know, one of the constraints for, especially for even with Apple's discount for a lot of educational institutions and students in getting Apple Harbor's always just been the price.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Well, you know, I know more than a dozen people, I can only afford a PC because I'm right.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Now, if you can get a Mac for the price of, you know...
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Wouldn't you prefer one?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Most people would actually mind it because it's...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I think the reason that Apple decided to introduce the darn Mac mini is because they wanted the people to say they couldn't afford it to all of a sudden be able to afford it.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And I don't know if they're selling as many as they wanted to.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Well, you know, I think that's all well-intro, but I think the other...
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   That's what you keep being overlooked here, which is the fact that I think Apple in a market where everybody was using the Mac OS and the PC was getting the Mac OS.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   That Apple could sell their machines still in the same market at a premium because I think people have been buying the Mac many times because it just looks a lot better.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It's a lot cooler on machine.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I really think that they could be a true looking for these guys if it gravitates.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah, who wants a beige box when you can have this slick, you know, stainless steel, you know, glowing machine?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   But I mean...
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Yes, if it's only a couple hundred bucks more.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Apple, according to Think Secret, Apple has announcements this week, a number of announcements this week.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Come on, some of them aren't that interesting. They'll probably do low priced Mac minis, low priced die books.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Obviously, they've got to clear out their stock of G4 based products before they introduce any Intel products.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   It would be too soon for them to announce an Intel product this week, wouldn't it?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Because they've just now talked about, you know, getting IBM to make what the power PC or no, I mean, sorry, Intel too.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   To do like a custom Intel core processor that their OS is going to run on.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Oh, you think they're not going to use a stock Intel Pentium D?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I think the dialogue has been that it's not going to be a stock Pentium.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Oh, I haven't heard this. This is interesting.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Have you heard anything like that, John?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   No, and I don't believe it.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You think they'll use stock Pentium?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I don't think Intel can afford to make a special part for these guys.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I just don't think it's a...
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Well, it's certainly, I mean, Intel's chief interest at this point would be in selling their stock parts, right?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   That's just one more big customer, a good customer for them.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   When you asked what Microsoft would do, you know, my first thought is that maybe for the first time we would see Gates unlumber, or unlumber rather, some of their vast arsenal of patents.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Because they've got patents on some of the most amazing core technology that almost any OS has to use and that everybody's in violation of.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Oh, but you don't want to open that can of worms, because then you go back to court and Apple countersues over the trash can.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I mean, it's...
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Well, you know, there's also... I did some research on this a couple of years ago, and Apple's got a ton of those kinds of patents too.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Everybody does. It's an arms race.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yeah, IBM, yeah. And SCO is going to find some reason to sue also.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   But I think right now we're in Daytona. I mean, it's literally... it's mutually assured destruction.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Nobody wants to be the first, because you're right. It's a can of worms.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And it's... you know, that's what it is. It's a deterrent.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   You know, you keep it around and just say, "You know, hey, I might..."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Well, I have to say, nothing would put a bigger smile on my face than Apple doing a Mac OS that ran on a PC platform.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You... I mean, today on the radio show, I was about to tear my hair out.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I'm looking at the board. Every single call was Windows XP's broken.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I got the blue screen of death. I got a virus. I got spyware.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I'm looking for anywhere. I'm looking for light. Some interesting call.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I spent three hours talking about how to fix Windows. I can't imagine a worse radio show.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You know, Microsoft's killing my business here.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Well, and also remember now that... remember when they first started talking years ago about charging for tech support?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   How counterintuitive it sounded that they would be charging people to fix the problems that, you know, arguably they have in their system.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Now they're moving into antivirus and anti-spyware. Again, to, I mean, subscription-based, to sell people subscriptions, to fix problems that, you know, they haven't addressed for years in their OS.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Because now it's widespread enough that it just sort of, "Oh, it's not our responsibility. It's not our fault."
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It's a protection racket. It's Vinnie Bumbai. He comes in and he says, "You know, you could have a fire in your restaurant.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   If you give me some money, I'll keep it from happening."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   It's so wrong. It is wrong. It really is.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's so shady. I mean, if you think it, if you did apparel with the, you know, car industry and, you know, Ford says, "Well, you know, you had a tires blow up, but you pay us the insurance money, you won't make sure it won't happen."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Come on.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   It's protection.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Well, you know, just Wells Fargo last week made it similar announcement. They said that if you pay extra, they'll do something about the fact that your identity theft, that would replace Fargo.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   You solved.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   We're all these guys.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I mean, that's Hutzpah. That's the definition of Hutzpah, right?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Well, I have a very good friend of mine who's a computer illiterate realtor. And she's wonderful. She just wants to be able to surf the web and do eBay.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And now she had to do her multiple listings now through the net.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   She couldn't use what she used to call her modem any longer.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And someone came over to her house the other day and was complaining that she was running Windows 98.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Well, I mean, she's got a computer that I set her up with and I tend it and keep it running.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And it does everything she needs. And she called me and said, "Steve, you know, do I need something called XP?"
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And I said, "No, Judy." I said, "The reason you've never had a virus and have no problem with spyware is that nothing can infect your machine anymore because it's so old."
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So the solution now is to have a computer so old that hackers have no interest in it.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Exactly. It's sort of like having a Mac. It's got a little enough install base that no one targets it.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Is that really the secret of the Mac's success? It's just too small to be ready to work out.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Actually, I think it's that most of your typical script kitties have Windows boxes.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And so they attack what they own. So Bill Gates got yelled at for making a quote, which I think he should have gotten yelled at.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   It was funny. But I think he still kind of had a point when he was saying, "Our operating system is more secure because more people hack it."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Yeah, he said that, didn't he? I understand where he was going.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Exactly. Yeah, when he was coming to the house.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It didn't sound good, though. It came out really bad.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's a very bad sound bite.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   So the other big Apple announcement, or I guess it's Apple related announcement, is that everybody's expecting that tomorrow, Motorola, will finally show its iTunes capable phone.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Do we care?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I mean, you know, I used to think that'd be great to have every piece of electronic gadget, a PDA cell phone, MP3, all stuck in one.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And then it occurred to me at one point when I had my cell phone in my DJ, MP3 player.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   My DJ ran out of juice, but I still had it in my phone.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And in those instances in emergency, I'd still rather have my phone working, you know, just for that emergency.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You know, so what if I can't listen to me in music? If I can't call someone, you know, when my car breaks, then I'm really kind of...
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I don't want to be the kind of guy that's got 18 devices hanging off my belt and has a big butt crack as a result.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But at the same time, I think you're right. I don't think that to put it all in one device, maybe not necessarily the way to go.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   MP3 player should be an MP3 player, not a phone.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   At minimum, two devices. And then you're set.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   How about not carrying around a bunch of garbage?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Well, yeah, I don't want to Scott Evest because I don't want to be in my pocket.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   I like my Scott Evest. I know. I'm a nerd. What can I say?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   What do you carry, Devorak? Do you have anything at all that you carry?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I carry the small pocket camera.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   That's it.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   You don't even carry a cell phone?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Yeah, I do. I think I'm going to be driving around for a while. I put a cell phone in the car.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I usually keep in the glove box. I don't carry a cell phone with me. I don't want to be bothered all the time.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   This is from a guy who only recently, maybe you still don't. Do you have an answering machine?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Absolutely not.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Yeah, that's what I thought. You call him rings and rings.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   You know, I found out over the years that people get more angry with you.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   If you fail to call them back, if they leave a message, then if they can't get a hold of you.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   That's a good point. Maybe I should get rid of my email address.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   How do you handle that, John? You must get tons of email.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I get lots of email, but I got a great system. Computer time, Mark Pecal does a great job to keep spam.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I get zero spam. And the rest of it, you know, I just go through.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   You're just going to call it an hour a day to go through my email.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I've read these statistics before. I don't think I've ever mentioned this group, though.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I have a spam service also called MailRout. It's a commercial service.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I'm real close now to getting a million messages a month of which 98% are spam.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I get almost 900,000 spams a month.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And that's to all of the Leoville addresses, including spurious addresses like Leo's Hair at Leoville.com,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   which gets a goodly amount of mail.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   You actually have that? No.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Did your hair ever write back?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Never wrote back. I never hear from my hair.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Because you're wearing a two-pack.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   You've got to have good spam filtering clearly.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   What I've started doing, I don't know if this is going to work. In fact, it's not working yet.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   But what I do now is I do a triage thing, right?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   So I get several real mail messages a day.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And I have the press the flag button.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Okay, I look at the message. If I need to answer it, I press the flag button and the rest of my ignore.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   The problem is now I have this massive folder with the flagged mail that I haven't answered.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So that's not a solution.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I actually do a filter where if my name doesn't appear anywhere in the message, it just gets to set.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   So you mean if I send you a message and I don't say "Roger" in it?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   No, if it's at work.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   There's a lot of garbage at work.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Well, there's a lot of garbage because they route all the group email through us as well.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   That's awful.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   If none of the message actually has my name in it, then it just gets filtered into a standard and box folder.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I suggested something to Mark Thompson a couple years ago that he adopted immediately
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   and that we've just recently done with our main sales and support accounts at GRC.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And that is to just append the current year after your name.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   So he's, you know, Mark 2005 at analogx.com.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   So it changes every year?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Yeah, and the beauty of it is that if he doesn't set up a new account or if somebody has his old address in their email address book
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and a little ways into 2006, the mail bounces back, when you look at the address, you go, "Oh,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   it's 2006 now."
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And you're able to sort of guess what the problem probably is.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   He says that by the, and he's done this now for a couple years, and there's enough of a latency and a delay in the migration of email into major spam lists
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   that he only gets a few every so often by the end of a year cycle.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   That's amazing.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And of course he loses them all when he starts the next year.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And if you send a message to Mark, you'll know, just always put the current year at the end of it and that way you'll know.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Yeah, and if you don't, it bounces back and you get the, "Oh, reply to..."
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Speaking of analogx from Mark Thompson, has anyone used his new BitTorrent client?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Has he released?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   No.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He has a new BitTorrent client.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Oh, I'll have to check it out.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I knew he was writing one.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's not quite released.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   It says it's a beta release.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Download the installer here.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   It says on the website.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Mark took off for a little three-day Canadian fishing trip on Thursday and announced in one of our news groups.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Because our groups have helped him in the past to pound on his stuff.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And he's calling it beta, but the UI is all finished.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And it's got a lot of nice features.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I'd love to migrate to it.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I'm using BlogTorrent right now for the Twit, and it's okay, but it's not great.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I think Mark would probably do a better job.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Did he ever do the spam fighter that he was going to do?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I'm the only one in the world still using it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   He was very early on to Bayesian bandwagon, but a bunch of other ones came out.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And he just ended up not pushing any further.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I'm on the Bayesian bandwagon, baby.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Well, that bandwagon sucks.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I get off the Bayesian...
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Hey, speaking of us, you know we have a new slogan now for the show.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Thanks to the New York Times.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   This week in tech, combining a mind-numbing commitment to tech news with surprisingly valuable information.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Oh, I read that article.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Wow.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   We'd be buff-blowing with that one.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   This is from Virginia Heffernan who wrote about podcasts in the New York Times on Wednesday.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Or, I guess it was Thursday.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And she says, "The tech," I'm quoting her, "the tech podcasts, including prominent ones like Dignation and this week in tech,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   are especially prone to self-promotion."
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Devorek told me not to do that, so I'm not doing that anymore.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And though annoying for listeners, it evidently pays both show up on iTunes' list of top subscribed podcasts,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   the two podcasts compensate for the displays of self-love.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Oh.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Have we displayed any self-love lately?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I love you, Roger.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I love you.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   The two compensate for the displays of self-love and their mind-numbing commitment to tech news.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   She pulled out the source for that one.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   It's got to be one or the other.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   We can't be self-love and self-love by the way, I say, you know, what that's supposed to mean.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Yeah, we're owning this.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Exactly.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   She also called, she actually had, there was a retraction in the article because she called another podcast or an addict.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   But that's, and he wasn't.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And it's a two-pockets compensate for the displays of self-love and their mind-numbing commitment to tech news was surprisingly valuable information.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I just find it mind-numbing.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I love it.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   I don't care.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I think it's a great slogan.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It's our new slogan.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Mind-numbing?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Combining?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   No, no, listen.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   It rolls up the tongue.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I think mind-numbing.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Just keep that mind-numbing.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Well, that's the short version.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   If you go to the Twit.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Twit.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   What is our website?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   If you go to Twit.tv or this week in tech.com, you'll see it right at the top.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Combining a mind-numbing commitment to tech news was surprisingly valuable information.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Don't you think that's good?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So, Twit.com was taken?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Yes, it was.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I don't know who has it.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I don't want it.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I think it's a Welsh theater group, as a matter of fact.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   A Welsh improv theater group.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I'll have to check.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Why did you put valuable information since 1998?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Well, that's just when tech TV started.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I could have said it.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   TV?
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Devorik and I have been doing it since...
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Well, what can I start?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   In 1998, I did the data.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   It's just...
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   No, I think it's Cori.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Alright.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Alright.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I listened to John.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   He's the one who said stop with the self-love already.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Oh, you know, he's proven that.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I'm making a mess.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Get out of the kitchen.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   I'm not really a mess.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   You're making a mess.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   There needs to be more women on this show.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Well, we tried it and everybody complained.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Oh, they did?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Well, we had Jessica on.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   I remember.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I loved Jessica, but I got so much hate mail.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I just decided that's it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   No more women.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Maybe it wasn't women in general.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Oh, you're a general.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   You're turning into a Tom Likis.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I hate women.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   We have a real problem with my life.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Let me tell you.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   But I will get Megan on sometime soon.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   We got to get Megan on.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Because that's a one.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   She's a wild.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   She's a wild.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Once in a while, a woman.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   There's our new slogan.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   One woman.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   A woman once in a while is okay.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Combining a mind-numbing commitment to tech.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   You're so lucky you're the bear.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   No, this is her around the world, don't you know?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   We have an international audience.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   But people that listen that can actually, you know, come up and do something.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Global embarrassment.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   There you go.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Is global embarrassment work worse than local embarrassment?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I don't know, I don't think so.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Embarrassment is one of those things that's local, not global.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Don't you think?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I mean, it doesn't, you know, you don't know.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   They call it the Embarrass globally.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   That's a new slogan.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   That was another thing.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   They said, "Don't talk politics, so we won't."
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   All right.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Religion.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Or religion.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Mom was right.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   What do you get in the radio show then?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Nothing.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Politics.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   We're not Windows XP, apparently.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   We have to stay with technology.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   All right.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   All right.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Let me, I'll tell you what, one thing we do have is lots of questions for our listeners.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And I could just play a few of those if you'd like.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Sure.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   You want to have some?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   These are all vetted.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   These don't have any.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I haven't listened to them at all.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   This is called "Just Playing It Off the Laptop."
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Hello, Twit.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Hello.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   This is Cody from Tisdale, Canada.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Hello, Cody.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I'm not wondering what you guys thought of the new Windows Vista.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Oh, I'm a horny.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I think we already talked about that.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Actually, you know, it kind of reminds me of the old Plymouth Horizon.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   It does sound like a car, doesn't it?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   The Vista?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   The bad car.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Yeah, the Plymouth Horizon.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Like a K-car.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Yeah, it was.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   It was a piece of junk.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Sounds like a K-car.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Hi, this is Brian in Austin, Texas.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   You guys do a great job.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I'm glad that you guys are all back together and do in the podcast.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And my question pertains to my work programs.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I run my work blaster and I'm wondering if I download and install the Microsoft Antispiler
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Program.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Are those two going to conflict?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I know a lot of times you recommend having more than one Antispiler Program.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   However, these, in particular, programs seem to do, you know, similar memory-resident things.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And I was wondering if they'd have problems knocking heads with each other.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   So anyway, thanks for all the good information and you guys are doing a great job.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Actually, that's a great question.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I'd like to direct it to Steve because you're the spyware king, the guy who coined the term spyware.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Well, actually, I don't have an answer because I'm, I guess I'm a little freaked out by memory-resident spyware testers.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I like spybot-surgeon destroy and, of course, Adaware and now Microsoft solution.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And so, you know, I recommend people use all three if they're, you know, real anal about making sure their system has no spyware in it.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   But I just like to scan periodically rather than have something there all the time messing around with my system.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   I just, you know, the more stuff you've got in there, the more opportunity for trouble.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I would agree with you, except...
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   And, boy, I hate to disagree with you over spyware.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Your core competence here.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   But the only issue I see is that spyware programs no longer are any good at removing spyware.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   So by the time you're scanning for it, it's too late.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It's not like an antivirus.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   The only value at this point that spyware programs have is in blocking infection, not in detecting and removing infection.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So that, for that reason alone, I think that you almost, don't you have to go memory-resident?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And hopefully catch something while it's not like detected before.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Yeah, before it gets there.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   That's what spyware blasters, that's the one that modifies Internet Explorer, so it's a little safer.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Right.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You use Internet Explorer still, Steve?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I use IE, but I don't use any spyware scanners or anti-spyware or anti-virus or anti-anything.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Well, how do you not get infected?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Because he's vigilant.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I'm really careful.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Actually, I've got IE lockdown, so it won't do much.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And then when I go to a site that I decide I really want to use, I add it to my trust and zones list.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And so I'm just very careful.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Yeah, so as you said, I'm just very vigilant.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   So you only see the sites that you know are safe.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   You can't go to a site that's not safe.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Well, I go to a site, like for example, if I'm doing some e-commerce and I notice that I select a state that I'm in and the zip code doesn't self-populate.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Sometimes they have some JavaScript there that you do want to actually have running.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So I go, "Okay, I'll trust that site."
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And I add it to my trusted sites list and then it becomes fully functional.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   But I don't surf around the internet going sort of blindly clicking on links with IE in its normal condition because it's really just not safe enough.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   John, what do you do to protect yourself?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I use Previx.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I think I'm at a moment here where I'm feeling the media protection.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I use Previx along with about three of these other spyware scanners.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Previx sounds like a male enhancement drug.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   What is Previx?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   E-R-E-V-X.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Where did that question come from?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Huh?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   P-R-E-D-Sensually a memory monitor.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   It looks for anybody that tries to do weird installations out of the blue.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   That's interesting.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Have you ever heard of that, Steve?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I'm only hearing your audio.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Oh, you're not here, John.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Okay, John says he uses a male enhancement drug called Previx.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Can you hear him now?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Is that M-A-L-E enhancement?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   No.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   A male M-A-L.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   I'm not here to drop out of it.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   I had to ponder him out for you.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I never heard of Previx, but you like it, John.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   It sounds like an idea.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   It catches some...
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It catches systems that try to sneak an install on you.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   It just basically monitors the registry and if it sees something weird going on.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And it sees anytime it's trying to do an install at all.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It tells you, "Hey, guess what's going on?"
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And it pops up and it says this program and the temp file is trying to install something.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You really want that to happen.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Well, that actually makes sense.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   That's basically an ID, an intrusion detection system.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I'm sorry, I missed that.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Oh, it's alright.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   You didn't miss anything.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Let's go on.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Hey, guys.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   This is Caleb Allen in Merced, California.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And I'm basically looking to get started on the side of my own.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And I'm just kind of playing around with it, learning from the whole experience.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And I'm trying to get an RSS feed going.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I don't necessarily know how to do it and I've been checking on the internet and trying to
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   figure it out.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   But nobody seems to give you any practical links on how to get it done.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   So I was wondering if you guys had any ideas or any places to check out.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   By the way, love the show and guys, keep it going.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Let's call for Chris Perilla.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Oh.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Does anybody do their own RSS?
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I mean, every blog has its own RSS feed.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I have to say I've learned to encode my own XML RSS feeds for iTunes purposes.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   I do hand encode all our feeds.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   How long do that thing?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Oh, it's a pain.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   But I found actually a really good program called Feeder.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   I'll put a link in the show notes for this because it's a wonderful program.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It's for encoding RSS feeds.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   So you can hand encode them.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   It doesn't understand iTunes.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Yes, it's going to do that next month.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And that will save me an immense amount of time.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   So I can't use it yet, but right now what I do is, you know, XML is not that hard to.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   It's like HTML.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   It's not so difficult.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   You just need the patience.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   You just need the patience.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   There's a wonderful book.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I have it here somewhere on writing RSS.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   PayPal hacks?
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   PayPal hacks is good too.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Yeah, that's...
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   You know, it's amazing.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   O'Reilly does books and everything.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   They have a book on hacking PayPal.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Who'd have thought?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Hey guys, this is Tyler, Sean, and Paul from Lososos, California.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   We were just wondering, whatever happened to Patrick's box of crap, you guys haven't
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   mentioned it for a while and I thought you were going to give it away as a prize or something?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Mmm, cocoa butter.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Anyway, so yeah, we like to show a lot.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Alright, I guess we'll hear from you guys later.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   See you crest out.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   There's three guys who need their own podcast, I think.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Maybe you should address Patrick's pile of crap.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Yeah, well, it may be moved to his new home.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   No, we have it and the real problem is that I have to go through all of these name submissions
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   and I'm not getting any help from anybody.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   So as soon as I see...
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I'll help you.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   You want to look at them?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I pretty much know who our winners are.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   It's just, you know, I'm just jammed.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   We're working conversation.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Thank you.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Who did that?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Was that Gizmo?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Was that you, John?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   What was that noise?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   It was actually, that was me, I'm recording this, if you can hear me, because the connection's
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   gotten so crappy that now when you...
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   He's gone.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Yeah, well, wait a minute, what's that noise?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   I don't think he can blame us for this.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   That was a nice way file though.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Recording conversation.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Yeah, that came across clear, so we really know what the problem is.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   He's not Gizmo.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It's John Devorex, who me was.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It's his crappy microphone that he pulled out of the closet.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   You know, I'm going to hang up on him, because that sound is not good.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I don't know.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It fades away into the eighth dimension.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Yeah, that was not a good sound.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Let's hear some more questions.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Hey guys, how you doing?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   This is David Collin from London, Ontario.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I'm calling from on my cell phone, so it's going to be quite expensive calls, so I think
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I'll manipulate my timing.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Ask two questions.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.400]   The first one is I hear you guys keep on talking about backup software, and I was wondering
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   about a software that not only backs up my data, but actually does an image file and
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   would be network friendly.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.000]   Thanks for the call.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   So I'm just going to pause it there, because we don't have time for like he does.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.400]   I have an absolute favourite.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   What do you use?
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   Imaging software.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.240]   It's from a German guy.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.600]   It's called Drive Snapshot.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:51.120]   And what I like about it so much is it's both a Windows and a DOS app, but from the
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.360]   Windows side, it does the whole job from within Windows.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.000]   There's a way that you're able to sort of snapshot an active file system.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.640]   I mean, so you can make an image of your running machine, the main partition while it's running.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   Wow, nice.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.440]   Supposedly, Acronis True Image does that too, although I haven't.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.280]   Ever since it goes got picked up semantic, I've been looking for another.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.040]   Is this a German company?
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.720]   Yeah, it's Drive Snapshot.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.520]   Which by the way means the same thing in English and German.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:28.120]   And what's really cool is that his file is then mountable, so you can mount it as a
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.920]   drive and browse it just like you would anything else, extract files from it and so forth.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.840]   You mount that image within the application itself or is it just like a...
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.440]   Well, it must be some software stuff.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   Yeah, you...
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440]   I mean, you can't...
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   Good question.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.640]   I don't know whether he associates that he has .sna for a first snapshot file extension.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.440]   But so it'll make an image of a running system.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.480]   I imaged my...
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.760]   Our main GRC server that I recently set up in 45 seconds.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   Wow.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   So it's really fast.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   How big...
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   How many gigs was that?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.400]   I think the server is like 1.7 gig.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   That's great.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.600]   That's got to be at full speed.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.160]   This also supports SADI too.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.840]   Because I know like when the issue with ghost before the application...
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.000]   Yes, see, that's the beauty since it's running in Windows.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.520]   Anything Windows supports, yeah.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.760]   I mean, yeah, you could image any drive, any drive that Windows sees.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   In the snapshot it also records the partition table.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.260]   So that when...
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.560]   So that in order to restore it, say that your system completely crapped out on you.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:41.120]   So you just boot DOS and manage to get this image visible to DOS somehow.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.840]   If it's on another hard drive, that's done easily.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   You may have to install, stick it on a USB thumb drive or something in order for DOS
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.040]   to be able to see it.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.280]   But then if you stuck in a new drive, it would say, "Ah, you don't have a partition
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   table.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   I'll re-establish the same partition table that you had and then put the image back for
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   you."
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.680]   You need to prep the drive before you image it.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   Exactly.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.080]   Is it how much is it?
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.400]   It's like 39 bucks or something?
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   That's going to drive snapshot.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   Do I have to remember that when you go home?
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   Drive snapshot.de/en.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   That's it.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   All right.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.760]   It is really a nice piece of work.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.920]   And they're trying to see how much it costs and it looks like it's free, but I don't want
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   to say that without it.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.440]   Sure, it's not, but it's not very expensive.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.280]   Well there's your Virginia Heffrin, an honorary, valuable, surprisingly valuable information,
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   piece of information for the show.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   Hey, this is Zach from San Bernardino, California.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.960]   Man, I totally love the show.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.880]   I've been watching it when you guys were on Tech TV.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.600]   We've got to make some video.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   I just recently found out about your podcast and I just wanted to say that I totally love
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.040]   the podcast.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.280]   And I was just wondering if you guys would give me your opinions on your, or just your
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   opinions on Tech TV or TV.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.280]   And that too.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.280]   Please emphasize it a lot because I totally hate that.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.600]   You know, I have a, I'll put this in if you don't mind.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.240]   I was at the Comic Con last weekend.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.040]   The Comic Convention in San Diego, the biggest one on the West Coast.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.200]   And I was there shooting someone, I had my old Tech TV crew shirt.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.280]   Lots of sweaty guys there and Vulcan ears.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   Actually, no.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   No.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   It's Star Wars.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.560]   Either a Jedi Stormtrooper, Wookiee, you know, one of the, oh goodness.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.400]   Nothing like being a guy, a heavy set guy in a Wookiee suit in a 98 degree day.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.760]   Hey, that was a pretty good looking Wookiee suit.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.720]   Anyway, I was, I was basically standing with my editor and we were talking to this guy
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.000]   that we were going to interview.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.280]   This girl comes up with a phone, cell phone on her ear, she watched her.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.960]   She's like, do you know Tommy, Tommy Tallarico?
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.200]   And Tommy Tallarico is one of the guys who does it.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.320]   He's like, oh no, I don't think I've ever met him.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   She said the rudeest thing to me.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.080]   She said, maybe there's a reason why.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.960]   And she did this entire conversation without getting off the phone.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.920]   And it's like, at that point, it's like, is this the-
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.840]   Was she talking to Tommy Tallarico?
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.760]   But she was one of those people that talks to you by not looking at you.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.360]   So- You mean a lot of them at the Comic-Cons?
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   No, she was like-
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.640]   They're all staring at a point over your left shoulder.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   No, no.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.240]   I mean, like literally- She wasn't even facing it?
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   No.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   She was like, she was like talking on her phone.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.440]   She was like- Was she angry about Tommy Tallarico?
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.440]   I don't know.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.280]   I guess, judged by her comment, I assume that somehow I was not worthy enough to actually
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.120]   meet him at some point.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.840]   Does she work for G4?
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   Oh my goodness.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.480]   Roger, what's the point of this, Andrew?
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.800]   No, no, my thing is this is the type of people that-
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   Come to Comic-Con?
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   No, they get it.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   That love G4 then.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   We don't want to know them.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   Hi, my name's Adam Gago.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   And I got a question.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.760]   I got a couple of Steve Os and a Mac for the OS 10.4.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.200]   And I'm trying to extract the video from Steve Os because my girlfriend's sister's to
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.840]   be on the TV show and I want to get an on TV.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.840]   So if you guys know the way of doing that, it'd be really cool.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.760]   I'm not too cat- How long is this show?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.160]   I don't care if you must hack it into it.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   It's up to you, isn't it?
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   I'll tell you.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   I'll tell you.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   Do you have to?
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   Alright, do you want to appreciate your show?
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   You're the king of this, aren't you, Steve Pipsen?
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.760]   Yep, I've got all this stuff nailed.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:16.240]   The bad news is the Tivo records in a format which is very non-standard.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.520]   So although it's possible to extract the MPEG-2 files and put them together using something
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.920]   called tie tool, T-Y-T-O-O-L.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:30.760]   If you just Google tie tool and maybe Tivo together, you'll find it.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.600]   That's the best tool for doing this.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:39.560]   And then there are ways to change the default configuration of the Tivo so that the files
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:45.760]   it does record and then subsequently extracted are much more standardized instead of the
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   strange resolution.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.720]   Well, it's also encrypted.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.640]   You do have to do that at least because it's encrypted.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.880]   You can't use it unless you turn off the encryption.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:01.120]   But the right answer to this is not to try to do a pure digital extraction, but just
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.920]   to play the Tivo back into any video capture technology.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   Get the analog.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   Get the analog.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   Exactly.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.720]   And then I'm way down in price.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:17.080]   I use the Pinnacle card which is a very nice board that captures to digital video, but
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.760]   there are many, you know, little USB dongle-y kind of things now that'll just suck the video
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.680]   in and stick it on your hard drive.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   And it's fine.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.240]   And then I still think that the Pinnacle's studio is the best video editing software,
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   at least on the PC platform.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.240]   You still like that, huh?
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.240]   I really do.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   I'm a W-U-se premier elements guy.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.920]   Have you used Premier a lot, Steve?
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.760]   No.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   I've got a copy right up there.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   I'm going to send it to you.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   Premier.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   No, Premier Pro.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   You know, ever since I started producing Premier Pro?
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   Pro is $800 though, dude.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   Element is $79.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   Adobe's tool?
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   Well, I mean, I did look at Premier when I was choosing this.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.800]   And for what I want to do, I mean, I'm not doing fancy video editing.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.120]   I want to suck out a TV show and remove the commercials quickly.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.800]   And for doing that, the Pinnacle's studio is rocks.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   That's true.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   How much does it cost?
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   It's cheap.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   So many bucks.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   I just come with the Pro, the hardware.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   You can do the Pinnacle's and the hardware.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.040]   Because Windows desperately needs to have an iMovie and maybe that's the idea.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.200]   It is the closest thing to iMovie on Windows.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   It's pretty buggy.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.560]   I mean, it's been fairly unstable.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   You've got it so it doesn't crash on you all the time.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.920]   Well, I stayed back on seven because they really started to destroy it with eight and
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.680]   nine are just horrible.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   You didn't mention that.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.880]   So seven, if you can find it with your stuff.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   I agree with you.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   Seven is good.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.880]   I agree with you.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   But the current version nine is crash-specific.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   No, crash-specific.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.560]   Well, it's all UI nonsense because, you know, and this is what we see so often.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   Everybody does this now.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:56.320]   Seven was a perfect product in the same way the Windows 98 second edition was a perfect
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.480]   product and then they ruined it with Millennium Edition.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.800]   I'll give you a better example.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   Nero.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   Nero is great.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.400]   You talk about trashing a wonderful program by just putting in gooey sugar.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.120]   There's no reason to put that in.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.520]   Although, you know, when my dad uses it, I tell him to use it because it's simple for
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.520]   him.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   It's better than Roxia.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.320]   I mean, Roxia was even worse if you're going to talk about sugar.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.360]   I don't even like the latest version of Toast that they have.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:28.000]   With Pinnacle Studio, you take a video clip, you basically chop it into segments somewhere
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.440]   during the commercials and then you just trim the ends of each one and put it together.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.840]   And it's just like in no time you're able to produce 60 minutes down to 40 by getting
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.560]   rid of the one third commercials.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:44.400]   Steve's given me some, actually I have to say, some great home brew DVDs of shows that
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.280]   you love and they look, is that how you do them?
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   Because they look fine.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   They look great.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.640]   They're very high quality.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.000]   American Dreams, I love that show.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Yep.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.560]   And I really appreciate your, I guess lending them would be the right.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.560]   Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm promoting you.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   I'm, I'm promoting you to watch the show.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.800]   No, it's actually able to do that.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.680]   The Home Taping Act allows you to do kind of personal copies for that kind of purpose.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.880]   I don't know if it'll apply.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.720]   The problem is nobody explicitly said it applies to digital media.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.800]   But, but for a while the Home Recording Act let you do things like that on tape.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.120]   Well, I, I do all my labeling with crayons.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   So that's non-digital.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.040]   Hey guys, Justin T here in Houston, Texas.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.520]   I love the film and a big fan ever since you were the early days there on Tech 2v.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.280]   Just really mourned the loss of that.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   Got a quick question.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.920]   I'm helping out a church here in Houston.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.720]   We've got a new property about a mile away from the school we're meeting at.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.520]   And the past do a live feed from that location.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.680]   I mean, there's, there's buildings and, and, and stores and stuff between that, that mile
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   there.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.280]   And they're really set on it.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:58.400]   So I was wondering, maybe I can set up a couple of 18 or 25 dvi wi-fi antennas and
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.120]   lift them, hoist them up and make that connection.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:10.760]   Maybe do a peer to peer computer thing there with AirPort and Apple eyesight or something.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   Is that even feasible?
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   So I just tell them they're nuts and, you know, stick to the Bible.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.400]   Just, hey, let me know.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   Thanks.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.400]   Bye bye.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   No, don't do, don't do a network at all.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.760]   Is he trying to, is he, is he capturing and trying to stream it?
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.240]   Or is he just wanting to send it wirelessly over the one mile distance so he doesn't have
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   that?
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.280]   Or is he going to promote either a remote congregation?
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   Sounds was, was what it sounds like.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   They can't get everybody.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.480]   Hey, that's why I, Leo, if you wanted to talk to Kevin, he's on Skype right now.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.880]   Oh, well, let's, let's, let's add Kevin.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   I think he's.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.120]   And it actually does sound like this guy's looking for an excuse for doing his little
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   Wi-Fi experiment.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.800]   I mean, there's, there's actually a couple of products that will allow you to send wireless
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   over.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   I wouldn't do wireless.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.600]   I would call a phone company, get an ISD end line put in.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.200]   I mean, there's so many better ways to do this than trying to do a wirelessly, don't
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   you think?
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   No, it's not.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.360]   The reason I say that is because I was looking at this thing for, for like exactly a year
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.400]   ago, I was looking for a solution so we could shoot down at E3 without, and send you it
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.960]   straight to the booth without having to run back.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.440]   So you talk an audio and video, right?
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.320]   It's basically a gig or her trans member receiver combo.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.920]   But they're just, the only thing is they're kind of, they're pricey, but they work pretty
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   well.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   Probably cheap out of the phone line.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.720]   But ISD end wouldn't be able to handle the video.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   No.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   You'd have to get a T1 for video too.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.720]   That's, that is an awful lot.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   He's on Skype.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.720]   I don't see him.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   You don't.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   We're just looking in contacts.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   There's Kevin Rose connecting.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.520]   Well, I'm trying to connect to him, but I don't, but he didn't show up as being online.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.720]   So we'll, we'll ring him and maybe he is.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   So you see him there?
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.720]   I see him.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.720]   All right.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.920]   Well, soon as Kevin's, I'll be the only one with a picture in Skype, aren't I?
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.920]   You are.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   I have a picture.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.840]   I accept I'm on my, I'll put it here.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840]   I'll put a picture.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.840]   I don't see your picture, Steve.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.600]   You know, I'm staring at the screen.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   It's good looking fella.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.960]   I don't even know how to put a picture in here.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   Let me see.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   It's in your preferences.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.840]   Yes, you have to give a, give a.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.840]   Actually that silhouette looks sort of like you, Leah.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   It does.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   It's actually, that's my silhouette.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.360]   Kind of that, kind of that, that cartoon version of you on Call for Health.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.360]   I mean.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.800]   Yeah, I do actually.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.680]   Let's move on to the next call here.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.160]   This is actually fella at a comment on our last episode just to show that we actually
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.720]   listened to comments on our episode.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.480]   This is Mark Anderson from Franklin, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   Keep up the good work guys.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.880]   It's nice to have you back.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   I wanted to comment on your coverage of GTA last week at the start of the show.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.040]   In my opinion, Rockstar added the code as a publicity stunt.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.880]   They locked it away, sent the finished product to the ESRB and they got there, I'm rating.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.120]   They knew all good and well someone to find it and that they would get good press on
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   it.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.320]   And if nobody did find it, well, they could always leak it when their sales started to
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.720]   sag.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.800]   In my opinion, if it's on the distribution CD, the ESRB should see it.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.120]   God of War got an M rating.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.400]   I'm a gamer and I am a father.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.320]   I will play whatever game I want to play no matter what the ESRB rating says.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.400]   If it's a good game, I'll play it.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.960]   However, when it comes to what I allow my children to play, if I don't know the game
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.480]   first hand, then I'm going to look at the ESRB rating, not so much the letter as the
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.800]   description of the content that's in it.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.160]   So it's not that big of a deal, Rockstar should probably be chastised for trying to
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.040]   slip something past the ESRB.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.600]   Yeah, I do that.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.480]   And as soon as it's AO, which is what happened, it was AO, that's when you know you're not
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.160]   going to let your kids look at it, right?
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.760]   Hey, Kevin Rose, are you there?
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.920]   Yes, can you hear me?
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   I do.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.560]   We hear a little bit of echo coming back from you, but are you listening to speakers?
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.320]   Yeah, actually, I haven't got everything hooked up.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   That's okay.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   You sound good though.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   Oh, thanks.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   So what happened?
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.880]   You broke down in Southern Canada in the valley?
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   What happened?
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:56.120]   Yeah, basically about, I'd say an hour outside of LA, we had a hose break on the truck that
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   we were driving up.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.760]   It was actually the radiator hose and it fell down inside of, what did it hit then?
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   You know what it hit?
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.520]   It hit some kind of hole or something anyway.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.360]   Oh, it hit the accessory belt.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.320]   Oh, the accessory belt.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.720]   Yeah, I don't know what it was.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.120]   I don't know much about cars.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.960]   Oh, the accessory belt.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.240]   You say it's a giant belt that goes through the front of an engine.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   Do you hit the data?
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   Snapshot bed.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.600]   I don't know, but we were down for at least probably about three, three and a half hours.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.680]   Minds me of my youth.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   We were down.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   The car was down.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.000]   That reminds me of my youth.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.800]   I broke down.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.360]   I was driving in Opal across the country in Old Opal Cadet.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   Holy.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:37.680]   And just outside, I was driving through Death Valley.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.480]   It was Death Valley, just outside of Bakersfield, a hose blue.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.880]   And man, that was a mess.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.800]   I actually taped it up with electrical tape.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.800]   So what did you do Kevin?
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   How did you get going again?
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.760]   Well, basically the guy finally showed up and then they tried to drive into town to buy
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.560]   another replacement hose for us, but it turns out that they didn't have it.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:01.160]   So he got some type of copper pipe that was threaded, was able to cut the existing hose,
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.320]   put the two ends together, and then finally just patched us together and get us back on
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   the road.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.320]   Very cool.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   What a MacGyver.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.240]   Did he, was he a representative from the rental company?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.400]   No, he wasn't.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.360]   He was like some kind of third party that they called.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.480]   The rental company is the people that brought him in.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.480]   But yeah.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.920]   Well, so you're in San Francisco or you in LA, right?
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.280]   So basically we missed our move in date, which was yesterday, into the storage facility.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.720]   So we just got down there and moved everything in this afternoon.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   You must be bullish.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   And now we have to drive back.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   Oh.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.480]   Well, I really appreciate your making yourself available.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   Do you want to head out?
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.000]   I mean, just, or do you want to stick around for a little bit?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.520]   I don't know how good, how's my, I don't have everything hooked up.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.000]   No, you sound great.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.360]   You sound as good as anybody.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   How far are you guys in?
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   About an hour and a half.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:55.960]   We had John for a while, but his mic gave up on him.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.160]   He was using gizmo.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.400]   We got him to do gizmo.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.760]   But yeah, and the gizmo was fine.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.840]   It was not a gizmo problem, but John had some crappy mic that he fished out of his
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   drawer.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.200]   Should we take some more questions?
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.640]   This is from my, my new favorite city.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   Hey, Twits.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.840]   This is Carl, calling from Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.440]   My question is concerning the apple going intel ordeal.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.920]   I'm a student and before the summer, I was sure I was going to get a new iBook.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.720]   So I've been saving up money and then this story comes along.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:29.880]   So what I'm wondering is, if I buy one now, will it be obsolete in a year when all iBooks
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.400]   ship with the intel processor?
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.240]   So I'd appreciate to hear what you guys think about it.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   Keep up the good work.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   Great show.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   Thanks.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Bye.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   Isn't that great?
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   We're getting calls from Stockholm.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   I just love that.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.120]   I don't think, you know, I mean, look, all the software that comes out from now on, well,
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.880]   maybe not from now on, but soon, will be dual binary.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.680]   They'll have a version for Intel and a version for G5 in the program, in the box.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.560]   So if you buy an iBook now, you'll continue for some years to come and be able to run
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.200]   software for at least past the lifetime of an notebook.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.440]   And this might be a very good time to buy an iBook because you'll be able to get a great
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.440]   deal.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.240]   I think I would wait till next week when they announced their prices.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:17.560]   On the other hand, a Pentium M Mac is a much nicer notebook.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   It could be.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.800]   We haven't seen it potentially.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   I think the Pentium M is.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   What kind of prices are those going to be?
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   I wonder.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   Well, and the question is how long a weight from an announcement to actual on the shelf.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   Right.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.720]   And then the next thing with the teething issues with the whole new platform.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.040]   I would say if you don't have a current Mac, if you didn't buy one the last year or so,
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.840]   and you're ready to get one or you need a new one, buy one now.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   This actually is a good time.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.760]   I'm actually going to buy one of the near future just because.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.080]   Yeah, they'll be cheap.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.600]   And will they do an emulation layer?
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   That's what they're doing.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.040]   They have an emulation layer.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.040]   Okay.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:00.000]   So that's going to be slower running old style software on the new platform.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.040]   Well, very few.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.280]   I don't think many programs will come out that are Intel only.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:09.720]   At least for a few years during a transitional phase, every program that comes out will have
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.680]   binary for both processes.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.320]   But I'm thinking the other way around.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.960]   What about running existing Mac and Power software?
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   On Intel.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.240]   No, they do have an emulation layer.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.880]   That's this transitive stuff.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.600]   And while they're claiming it's really good, it's emulation.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.440]   So it's not going to be no matter how good it is.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:32.240]   It's not going to be as good as code that's available for me.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.200]   No, Apple does move on to a multi-core within the foreseeable future.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.120]   Would you be able to slave that emulation process onto a--
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   It'd be interesting.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.280]   Separate core and perhaps speed it up so it'd be transparent to me.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   That's interesting.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   Can you give a pity?
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.480]   We're looking for it to buy one brand new Power Mac G5 for editing.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.280]   And we're just going to go ahead and get it.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   I mean, I don't want to have to wait.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.760]   And then there's going to be that transition period just buy it if you want it.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.760]   And you know what?
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.760]   Once you buy a Mac for that purpose, it's pretty solid.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.600]   It's not like down the road, oh, I need something.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.880]   It will serve you well in that capacity.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:11.920]   Kevin, I was telling the guys that we were putting together a remote kit, right?
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.560]   So we have a remote mixing board.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.600]   Well, because we're going to probably start doing this once you get moved up here, maybe
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.960]   mid-September doing this with a live audience.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:23.280]   And by the way, a number of venues have come forward to offer.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.120]   In fact, I'm crossing my fingers on this brew pub that's come forward and said we'd
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   like to host it.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.400]   If we get that worked out and there's a local radio station in San Francisco says once
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:37.600]   you guys get it going, we would be glad to do a live broadcast on this local terrestrial
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   station.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.640]   It's on like a sneaky guy to the six floor and see that building.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.640]   Maybe we can't.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.880]   And any of it, what I was saying is I bought a PC for recording and I because I'm not going
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.040]   to schlep my tower.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.160]   It weighs about 80 pounds.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:57.160]   So I bought a shuttle PC with a FX86 64 rather FX64MD and a Raptor drive.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.480]   And that's going to be a perfect recording unit.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.840]   Yeah, it's a perfect side to carry around with you too.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   Yeah, so there you go.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.600]   You don't have to have a Mac.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.520]   The right tool for the right job, I say.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.040]   This is Jason from West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:19.840]   My question is regarding pre-N wireless adapters and why you can't find them in the USB form
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   factor.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.840]   Thanks, bye.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.960]   I'm sorry we lost to Vora because he's big on this pre-N thing.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.560]   I should try getting him back.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.560]   So he's basically asking why there are no USB adapters.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.760]   They're all what, ethernet or internal?
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.240]   I think they're all internal that I've seen.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.160]   That's Gizmo saying hello.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:47.000]   We're called John and see what he has to say.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.720]   John is the one who told me only get pre-N stuff that's using the air go.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   Hey John.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.720]   Hey John.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.720]   No.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.720]   Hey, remember he's going to let it ring.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.720]   I don't have to answer it by an item.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.720]   I don't even voice know.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   I thought he didn't have any.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   The Vora has voicemail.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   The Vora has voicemail.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   All right.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.720]   I thought he told us to.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720]   He lied.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   He doesn't know.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.720]   He just doesn't know.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   Well at least we know not to bother leaving a message because he'll never return the call.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720]   That's true.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   Because he doesn't want to upset us.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.720]   Well he sent me three messages.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.720]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   He's maybe his system is kind of.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   He's the one who said by the way on the pre-N's that the best way to go on the pre-N is anything
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   with an air go chip.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.720]   But maybe, I mean they're so fast.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   Maybe USB isn't fast enough.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   Maybe you can't keep up a movie.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   You're getting up to 100 megabits reliably on these things.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   Here's John's.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.720]   Off the USB tool to do four.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   This is you go.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.720]   This is John.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   This is voicemail.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   Okay.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.720]   There's one.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   There's one.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720]   Let's see.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720]   Where'd you go?
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   What happened here?
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   I was talking.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   I'm talking here.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   So did you guys see that there's a school in Virginia that is selling 1000, 1000, I books.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   Is this Virginia Tech?
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.720]   No.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.720]   It's a high school.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   Oh.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   50 for $50 each.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.720]   1000 laptops we sold to the school warehouse on the day.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720]   What models?
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.720]   There are white power PCs with 12 inch screens, 320-inch memory.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.720]   Where do I send it?
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   10.2.8.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720]   First come first serve.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720]   You got to show up.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720]   Oh, you got to go to Virginia.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720]   All right.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   Well, Alvar, I'll have Twit listeners in Virginia.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   We're going to go to Virginia.com in Los Angeles.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   This is more of a request or announcement than a question.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.720]   We're holding a huge land gaming event this July 30th and 31st in Pasadena, California.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.720]   I was hoping for a mention on your podcast.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.720]   A little bit about the event.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.720]   Landfest 2K5, we're going to be giving away over 70,000 in cash and prizes.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   We've already registered 526 attendees for the main gaming event and to bring your own arena.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   We have a case mod competition with Jeffrey Stevenson and Paul Capello overseeing.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   Paul Capello is famous in the community for his DOOM 3 case mod.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.440]   We'll also have the infamous cyberathlete fatality to challenge anyone brave enough to try to
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.000]   fragment painkiller.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.360]   Our exhibit floor will include large boots representing AMD, ATI, Microsoft, and Canon.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.800]   Please call me at 562-271-4106 extension-3389 for more info.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   Thanks a lot for your time.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   Bye-bye.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   I don't do plugs on Twit.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.640]   That's a serious newegg.com plug.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   I like newegg though.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.200]   I mean, we should give them a plug.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   They're nice.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   And that sounds like a good event.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.360]   I'm sure they're right to have their phone number there blasted all over Stockholm.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   Oh, God.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   I think that's what they want.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.600]   Everybody in Stockholm, please call that guy now.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.920]   This is called completely unscreamed questions.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.360]   And I prefer it that way, don't you?
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   You're going to edit this down, Leo.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   I don't think so.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   I know.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.360]   I'm liking it.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.360]   I'm liking it.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.360]   That's what I do.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   I don't like to...
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.560]   The Twit stream of consciousness.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.520]   That's what people look at.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.400]   Isn't that what people want with this show?
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400]   Maybe.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040]   I like that.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040]   Let's hear that again.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   That was a good one.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.680]   Let's play that one more time.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.680]   That's a female.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.760]   I know you can't some Twit guys.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.560]   This is easy from Baltimore.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.240]   And I have a sad tool that works in low.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   I know, Susie.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.040]   I'm trying to network my home to pop PC running at Cpro and my laptop running at Cpro.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   So you would think...
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.040]   No, you know, I don't like this part.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]   I just like the beginning.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   Let's just listen to that again.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.280]   I'm telling you some Twit guys.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.040]   The rest just sounds like you're calling right here.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.600]   It sounds like another K as it works.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.280]   I don't want to hear any more of that.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   I've heard this.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280]   I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.080]   I'm thinking of putting Linux in the second operating system for my computer.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.280]   I'm wondering do I need Linux at all?
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   You do?
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.200]   You do if you want to put Linux as your second operating system.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.880]   It's STD, but I want a Linux working hard drive.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.680]   Not a live CD.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.240]   Thanks and keep it the good work.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.240]   I'm going to get the guesses.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   How old do you think that kid is?
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240]   12.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   15.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   15, you think?
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240]   No.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240]   His voice hasn't changed yet?
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   Did you sound like that when you were 15 coming?
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   Yeah, I did actually.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.240]   He still does actually.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.240]   A little bit.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   So does this turn into what's your favorite Linux distress discussion?
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   Yes.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.240]   Oh my goodness.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.240]   Well, let's do that against the kid's age.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   I don't know.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   Are you a Linux user at all, Steve Gibson?
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.240]   No, I'm a free BSD guy.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.240]   Hold on.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   This might be Opera.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   Hi, this is Leo.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   That's the CEO of Opera.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   Wow.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.240]   And I think we want to put him on, don't you?
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   Yes.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240]   And he's going to have to do this swim?
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   Well, that's what we're going to ask him.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.160]   John von Tutsner is the CEO of Opera, one of the founders, one of the two founders of
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.360]   the browser company.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:53.640]   And the man who said he would swim from Norway to the US if Opera, there were one million
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.440]   downloads of Opera, the new Opera eight in four days.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440]   And there were.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.640]   And John, you made an attempt, didn't you?
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   Yeah, one swimming.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.920]   Oh, it went swimming.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.640]   You didn't get all the way though.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:11.240]   I had a slight problem with the guy who got me into all of this by actually going out
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.200]   with this information.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.720]   He was going to be in a raft on the side.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   And there was a hole in the raft.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   He couldn't swim.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   I had to say them.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.080]   So I couldn't really let him die.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.560]   So that's how that trip ended.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.760]   It's the PR guys fall as usual, right?
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.800]   Well, I'm glad that you didn't drown.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.840]   And congratulations on the success of Opera eight.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   That's been great.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:42.760]   You've been very outspoken about Microsoft and Microsoft's kind of counter programming
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.760]   you.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.480]   For instance, they apparently have some code in their site that looks for Opera.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:54.840]   They have, well, they have had at least, and I think they still do.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:06:00.600]   For instance, there was a case where people couldn't get into the Amazon site where Microsoft
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.800]   would tell people that if you're using Opera, that Opera wouldn't support standards and
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.280]   they wouldn't let you in.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.520]   And there's been all the cases where they've been sending us code that doesn't work very
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520]   well.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.160]   Oh, is that familiar?
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.960]   It must make you pretty angry.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   Yes.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.960]   Oh, basically we don't think that this is the way things should be.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.920]   And we've taken this up with Microsoft a number of times.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.960]   And sometimes we try to do it in a funny way or even through the media.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.640]   But still, they're not really going out there a way to make things work with Opera, or
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.640]   to be safe.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.400]   It seems to be the opposite.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.640]   What would you like Microsoft to do?
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.680]   Just get out of the way.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.680]   That would be a start.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.440]   I mean, if they would actually not look for Opera and they would just feed us the same
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.880]   thing as they do in Internet Explorer, well, then it would be more a problem on the Internet
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   on our site.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.920]   But even better is that they actually would start to adhere to standards and make the
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.440]   standards, standards, the pages, standards, compliant.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440]   That would be good for everyone.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.560]   And I'm sure that that would solve all problems for whoever.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:18.040]   So you mean that the MSN is detecting the Opera user agent header and changing the pages
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.560]   it serves when it sees that that browser is using MSN?
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.880]   That's the problem that we've been having, yeah.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   Oh my goodness.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:28.280]   Do you spoof the user agent and then what happens?
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.880]   Well, we always spoof, but you can always find out this Opera.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.120]   Actually, although in the latest Opera versions, we've been making it possible to actually
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   spoof totally.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   So it's impossible to know it's Opera.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   Right.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   And that's sometimes needed.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.520]   It shouldn't be needed.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.960]   But we've been having situations like this where, I mean, one case was Hotmail.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:53.400]   Hotmail users couldn't delete their spam mail using Opera.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.000]   But not because Hotmail was somehow a standards compliant and you weren't, but mostly just
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.200]   because they were detecting it.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.240]   Well, actually what was happening if you were using Opera on the Hotmail site, there was
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:11.360]   a function, a JavaScript function that you needed to call for deleting this spam.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.840]   And that function didn't exist in the code that was sent to Opera.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.760]   Oh, so they deliberately sent you...
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.760]   They disabled it.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.360]   So it looked like Opera didn't work.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.200]   Again, we don't know exactly why this is happening all the time.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.720]   I mean, it probably is in some cases it's someone doing a mistake.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.280]   But the thing is when you're looking for the Opera in the ring and then send us faulty
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.160]   pages, well, it makes us wonder.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160]   Opera's done very well.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.880]   Opera 8 is very popular.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.600]   There are issues with some pages, Opera not working.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.400]   Are you fully standards compliant?
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.040]   Is it that the pages aren't compliant or is it that you can't support all the standards?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.760]   I think we are probably the most standard compliant browser on the planet.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:06.720]   I think it's more like the pages are using, put handfully something Microsoft specific.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.120]   Sometimes it's even a question of Opera supporting standards better than the other browsers.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.280]   And then they're actually coding around problems in the other browsers with them to give us
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   problems.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:24.240]   So really the issue is more that people design pages for Internet Explorer.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.240]   That's really the issue.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.880]   I mean, that definitely is a problem.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.960]   And part of that is that Microsoft never went out of their way to support the standards
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   fully.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.400]   The fact is that they've been supporting parts of the standards.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.080]   And then it's very difficult for web designers to know which parts are working, which are
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.080]   not.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080]   Right.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.400]   And then they code it to make it work with IE.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:50.360]   And then they may be even programming around a bug in IE with them and not working in Opera.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.240]   Luckily there's less and less of this, but it's still a significant issue.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:00.200]   And we are spending quite a lot of time in getting pages to work that should have worked.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.960]   We're talking to John von Tuchner, who is the CEO and founder of Opera Software, the Norwegian
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.240]   Company that makes one of the three top browsers in the world.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.720]   And I'll tell you, people who use Opera are fanatical about Opera.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.840]   I mean, you have your strong adherence.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.520]   On the other hand, it's been a struggle for you against Internet Explorer.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:24.160]   Then along comes Firefox and starts to really take market share from Internet Explorer.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.400]   Why wasn't that Opera?
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.960]   Well, I think in a way that timing for Firefox was great.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.600]   I mean, if you look at it, Mozilla has been trying for very many years.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.880]   They've been working on this browser since 1998.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.240]   And it's great that they're having some success.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.840]   I mean, the browser is good.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.120]   And I think in a way they came out with a browser at the same time.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.200]   There was a lot of focus on security issues in IE.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.760]   So a lot of people then looked at an alternative and they found Firefox around it and they really
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   liked it.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.920]   And it's a good browser.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.120]   It's not as powerful as Opera, but it is a good browser.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.360]   And I can understand that people like it.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.520]   So how has it been for Opera lately?
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:15.480]   Has the success of IE, I mean, if Firefox helped you succeed as it has it kind of established
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.480]   a market for a non-Internet Explorer browser?
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.040]   I think there's definitely increased interest in alternative browsers.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.680]   The fact that people are now downloading alternative browsers more obviously also means more downloads
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   of Opera.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.800]   And we believe that we can stand the competition quite easily.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.320]   You say people do like Opera, the people that take the time to actually download Opera
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.960]   and spend some time with it.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.400]   Quite a lot of them find that it actually suits them better than any other option.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.800]   So the reality is we're getting more downloads.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.400]   So this is a positive thing that there's more interest in the browser market.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.240]   And I think also with Netskips markets here going down so rapidly, I think it was good
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.120]   that another alternative came out there.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.960]   And Microsoft is not having more than 90% of the market.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.600]   And their alternative browsers are on the rise.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.840]   And it forces websites to consider other than a...
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.840]   Other than a...
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.800]   Basically quit being sloppy when they write a word.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   You've got to think of the rest of the world.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:20.200]   I think this is a very important thing.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.520]   Web designers really need to think about alternative browsers.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.240]   And they also have to think about the fact that the web is changing, that you're getting
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.880]   not only PC browsers but also mobile browsers.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.400]   And this is going to be changing quite a lot.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.880]   But obviously the fact that Firefox also supports that is quite well.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.240]   So normally if you're designing for Firefox, it will work in Opera and vice versa.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.720]   One of the things you did early on was move from a Windows-only platform to a cross-platform
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.720]   strategy.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.520]   And that's proven quite successful for you, I think.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.920]   I mean, I see Opera on cell phones and a lot of non-traditional platforms.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.120]   We've been working on this for quite a few years.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.160]   And if you look at it, I mean last year we were on 8.8 million phones.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.480]   So that's up from 2 million in 2003.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.080]   So there's a definite trend in the number of devices that are going out for the Opera
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.640]   and there's going to be an increase this year as well.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.320]   And I think this is very important.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.120]   If you look at it, there's a lot more mobile phones and PCs being sold every year.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.640]   And in a few years' time, all these mobile phones are going to have a full-blown browser.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.920]   And I think that changed the equation.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.040]   You can't really code for IE on the PC anymore.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:34.440]   You have to code for something that is working on different kinds of devices, different operating
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.520]   systems and different browsers.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.680]   And the only real solution to that is to our third standards.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.280]   Guys, if you have any questions, please don't let them...
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.160]   I don't want to monopolize, John, I'm thrilled that we get to talk to them.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.560]   Did you experience any resistance from mobile phone manufacturers when you kind of approached
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.160]   them or did they approach you about using Opera on their platforms?
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.560]   There's definitely been no negativity.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.600]   I mean, they've been wanting Opera.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.640]   Opera has been gaining momentum quite a lot.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.600]   And I think actually in the beginning, it was more of a...
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.280]   Is this really possible?
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.480]   I mean, a lot of them really didn't think it was possible to have anything else but a
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.800]   separate mobile internet.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.920]   But the separate mobile internet hasn't really taken off.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.320]   And then when people have seen Opera on the mobile phone, they've seen that it's actually
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.440]   is possible to use a full-blown browser on the mobile phone.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.240]   I mean, it is the same browser we put up to the mobile phone as we put in the PC, the
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.480]   core of it.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.080]   So this has been educating the market.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.120]   And so if you look at the market four or five years ago, people were thinking this is not
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.000]   going to work except on some high-end phones.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.880]   Now the trend is that we are moving into mid-range phones.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.400]   And I think in a few times, this is going to be the default.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.880]   You're going to have a full browser on your phone and hopefully quite a lot of these phones
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.960]   will be having Opera.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   Opera on Symbian is great.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.480]   I mean, there's no close second.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.840]   I mean, you really dominate on Symbian.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.440]   Now as a gamer, I have a question.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:12.520]   Are you or will you be considering a browser for the PSP?
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.800]   That is a question that is difficult for me to answer.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:25.400]   But this is decided on market, demand, market contracts and the like.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.360]   And so you never know.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:34.120]   We will port Opera to any platform that gives us volumes and users.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.480]   And that may well be the PSP in the future, but we have to see.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.000]   How easy is it port for you?
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.920]   What technologies are you using to make it so easy to go across platforms?
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.680]   Well, we've been doing these kind of ports since like 99.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.720]   So over time, we made it a lot easier.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.760]   Normally, we can have Opera as a prototype up and running on just about anything that
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.960]   can run anything at all in this space of weeks.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.280]   Are you using a virtual machine?
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   Are you in C?
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280]   How are you doing that?
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.440]   This is written using C++, but we made our code very simple.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.120]   I mean, we've always followed this kind of, okay, let's not make use of any Microsoft
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.200]   libraries or any other libraries that kind of tires into a platform.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:21.960]   We just tried to make more and more of the code ourselves and this makes for efficient
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960]   porting.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.760]   So what brings you to the US?
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.880]   Well, it's a combination of vacation and work.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.040]   I decided that this year I've been doing a lot of trips to the United States.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.280]   So doing the vacation in the United States, I'm going to say me a few trips.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.880]   So you kind of kill two birds with one stone.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.880]   So that's the biggest right now.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.400]   Currently I'm the last Vegas, yeah.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.600]   Beautiful circus circus.
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.800]   Probably the worst hotel in the year could have chosen John.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   Well, you know, I mean, I'm with a family and I was told that this would be a nice place
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.800]   to bring the family.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   The kids all love it.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   I'm hoping so.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.280]   There's a lot of these casino things downstairs and you know what?
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:08.280]   I'm not into gambling, so, but I'm fairly certain the kids will love that.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.880]   Where else are you going?
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.320]   Well, I've been in New York.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.680]   I've been on the West Coast a bit in different places.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:22.880]   And mainly in San Diego, we have an office in Carl's, but it was a natural choice.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.560]   Did you take the kids to Legoland?
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560]   Yes.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560]   That's fun.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560]   That's fun.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.640]   And are you going to the Grand Canyon?
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.000]   I've been to the Grand Canyon.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   Okay.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   Okay.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   You got to do that.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   If you go to Vegas, you must go to the Grand Canyon.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.320]   Yeah, the Grand Canyon is very spectacular.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.240]   It's a great view and I would recommend anyone to have a look at that.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.600]   I've only seen it through Google Earth, so I really have to make a trip there.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.080]   Well what's ahead for Opera?
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.440]   Anything you'd like to talk about?
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.920]   Opera Aid, of course, is a huge announcement and I think I've been using it and I've been
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.720]   very happy with it.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.120]   What's ahead for you guys?
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.240]   Well, we'll continue to strive to amaze, strive to come out with something that is
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.880]   better than anything else in the market and better than ourselves.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.240]   So that's always a focus for us.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.160]   We have to do this and we want to do this.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.560]   So you'll be seeing more interesting technology coming from us.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.840]   At the same time, we just continue working on the browser.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.200]   We are building up the company quite rapidly.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:26.520]   We added a lot of people during the last year and this allows us to do things faster.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.520]   So we will be coming up with a lot of cool stuff in the year to come.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.240]   The same applies to the other markets.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.800]   We're doing a lot on the mobile side.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.440]   I think there's going to be a significant increase in the number of phones going out
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.960]   with Opera this year and next year.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:48.440]   And then there's all these other types of devices like set up boxes and even cars and
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.440]   planes.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:54.040]   There's a lot of things that you probably will be seeing in the future.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.280]   One of the reasons Microsoft is so adamant about taking the browser market is ultimately
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.560]   in a networked world, the browser becomes the most important application on your computer,
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.760]   on your cell phone, on your devices.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.920]   What do you see the world through?
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.920]   It's your portal.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920]   Yep.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.640]   So that's an exciting area to be in.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.040]   Let's talk briefly about spyware then I'll let you go because I'm sure you'd like to
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.400]   get back to your family.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.200]   How do you deal with the issues of spyware, malware and so forth?
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.600]   Well, one benefit of how we do things is that because Opera is not so tightly integrated
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:31.000]   into the operating system, Spyware has a more difficult task with Opera than maybe with
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.400]   Intimal Explorer.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.400]   So that's one thing.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:42.000]   We just focus on security in general and so all these do-thing things and all the things
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.160]   that we have which is the main thing that we have to deal with is to make it as difficult
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.000]   as possible for anyone to do damage.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.840]   We've been doing a lot of these things with operate and then we will continue to do so
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:01.840]   just focus on any little item that we can do to increase security and this means that
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:09.240]   I think if you ask third parties you'll find that Opera is the most secure browser on out
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.600]   there and part of it is not having active access and not being tied into the operating
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.600]   system but also just the fact that if there's an issue and there are issues in all browsers
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.040]   then we fix them quickly and that's important.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.120]   Opera has always been in the lead and features you were the first to do, kind of tabbed browsing
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.160]   and multiple window browsing.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.880]   You've got wand which of course fills in passwords and so forth.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:35.200]   You've got voice activation, great UI.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.800]   Any innovations you want to share with us that are coming down the road?
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.440]   I think you'll just see new items popping up all the time.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.720]   It's very difficult for me to talk about if you should before they're out.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:53.120]   We don't really want to tell the competitors about what our next step is going to be.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.920]   What's great is there's cross-pollination.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.840]   Everybody looks at what everybody else is doing and obviously says we'd like to do that
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.840]   one better.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.000]   Certainly, thanks to your implementation of multi-window browsing, tabbed browsing became
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.760]   kind of the common way to do it and I think a huge improvement frankly.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:15.880]   I think a lot of people are using tab browsing and using people are still not everyone has
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.480]   found the sessions functions that we haven't operated yet.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.720]   I think that one is also going to be a...
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   I love it.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.720]   I've found it.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.720]   It's a definite requirement.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.600]   I think in a way when people start to use that they don't understand, okay, how did
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.600]   I do this before?
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.600]   Right.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.600]   Right.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.960]   Sessions allows you to save open pages as one kind of thing that you can reopen and go
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.800]   back to your session again.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.120]   And it really is a great way to work.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.400]   I have a session up and right out in front of me with a bunch of pages.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.440]   Can you really imagine the time before you just had to say...
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   It was hard.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440]   And those, it was a pain.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.880]   John, I really appreciate your time.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.480]   I hope you have a wonderful visit to the US and thanks for providing an alternative.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.480]   Thank you.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.480]   Opera is a great product.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.080]   Opera 8 is available now from opera.com.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.080]   John S. Von Techener.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.080]   I got it right.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.880]   It's so good to hear those stories because Lord knows that we...
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880]   There's a chance.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.760]   CEO and founder of Opera Software.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   Thanks for joining us today.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   Thank you.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   Take care.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   Well, that boy, we had a lot of stuff today in Twit.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:19.400]   We thank our guest, John C. Devorek, via Gizmo, at gizmo.com from Skype.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.600]   Of course, we heard from the great Steve Gibson of GRC.com.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.080]   This has been great, guys.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.480]   David Prager joined us.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.480]   Kevin Rose, too.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.040]   We wish you all by eyes and we hope you make it home safe in sound.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.120]   Kevin Rose, for Raja Chang.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.320]   I am Leo Leport.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.600]   A tip of the hat to Mark Blasko for our opening theme.

[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   Ashley Wit.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:47.160]   And he's good, and of course, the Twit logo by Dorothy Yamamoto.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.320]   I'm Leo Leport.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.800]   This is Week in Tech.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.080]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.080]   Have a great week.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:53.520]   We'll see you next time.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.860]   This because you like this one.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:03.000]   This is like this one.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.540]   This one.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:08.520]   This is a crapsid z aids.

[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:16.760]   This is crapsid Rhino.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.280]   This is everywhere just now.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:26.980]   Hey stomp!
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   This is the week from now on and now our servers dead.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   This week in tech.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   We are here.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.980]   Tech.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   Tech.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.980]   Tech.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.980]   Tech.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.980]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   Yeah, the Twitter army.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.980]   I don't know what the answer is. I really don't.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:23.380]   The
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.560]   This is amazing.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:35.120]   I'm like, I don't want to.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:41.000]   Do you wanna do it?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:49.680]   Do you wanna do it?
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:25:02.680]   Do you wanna do it?
