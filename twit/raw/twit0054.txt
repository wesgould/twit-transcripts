[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This is Twitch, This Week in Tech, Episode 54 from May 14, 2006.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   We have an unusual panel today. Once again, we're glad to welcome back John C. Dvorak.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Where were you last week, John?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I was in Brazil.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I missed the show because I just lost track of the day.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Oh, that happens. That's okay. Next time I'll...
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I never get...
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I never get...
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I was in Brazil the week before.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I was in Brazil the week before.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We're glad to have you back.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   John C. Dvorak, of course, said Dvorak.org/blog.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Mr. Patrick Norton from DLTV. He's back again.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Too good to have you back. We were both much missed.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   People said, "Hey, it's not Twit without John and Patrick."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Aww, well, we argued together so well.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   That's sweet.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We've got Jen Carter with us in honor of E3.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   She's been on once before. She, of course, hosts OpenAlpha.tv,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   which is a great video game-oriented podcast.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Even more than that, of course, comes on the call for help regularly in Canada,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   showing us her hacks.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   She was at E3 and she's talking to us from Southern California.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Hi, Jen.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Hey, Leo. Good to be back.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Welcome back.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And Al Lowe is here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And I know you know that name.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   He's the guy who created Leisure Suit Larry,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   one of the most famous game designers in the world.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   He was at E3 announcing his new game, Sam Swade.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And we'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Al, it's good to have you on the panel.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So real quickly, since Jen and Al were there, you're...
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And we won't belabor this, but your thoughts on E3.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   What was the big story at E3, Jen?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I think far and away from me and a lot of others was definitely the Nintendo Wii.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Just finally getting to play it and see it in action and wave around the controller.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Really, the Wii stole Thunder from the Xbox 360.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I guess there wasn't much to say about the Xbox 360.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It's been out for almost a year.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And PlayStation 3, which is kind of a surprise.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Al, do you agree?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Does the Wii get you excited?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   The Wii went in as the underdog and came out as the winner.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Kind of a surprise.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   What made the Wii...
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah, roughly story.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   What...
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   What made the Wii so interesting to the attendees out?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I think the controller, I think the integration of the software with the machine, just the
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   general buzz about the whole thing.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Everyone that I talked with said that was the big story.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Isn't that funny?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   If you'd asked me a year ago, is Nintendo out of the game?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   In fact, I think I might even have said this.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's now between Microsoft and PlayState and Sony, and nobody cares about Nintendo anymore.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I did say it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And a number of people said, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   The DS is a great product."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Jen, did you ever count Nintendo out or was I just misguided?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Well, I am one of the people I started playing games on television and then NES.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So I do have a soft spot for Nintendo, but the DS have been going strong since pretty much day one,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and the Wii is kind of capturing that same market, that market of people who don't really play video games.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   That's a surprise to you, John, that Nintendo is still in the game.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Well, you know, I was...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.960]   I actually stayed pretty close with this company, and I was a fan of the DS when it
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   first came out.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   I think you remember that.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   First I thought it was a little bigger than it could have been, but then I realized that it had all this potential with this touchpad.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   You thought it wasn't even doing well, I think at one point for some reason.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   But this thing has been a runaway success, and these guys, these Nintendo folks, have done a wonderful job of coming up with new concepts,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   which nobody else seems to be doing.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   I mean, if you looked at the PlayStation versus the Xbox, you have, you know, updates of football games
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   and updates of race car games, and yeah, they look a lot better, but this is the same old stuff.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   I think maybe it comes back to an "ow, you could probably comment on this" gameplay versus how it looks.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   A great-looking game will lose out to a great playing game every time.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   Is that true?
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   Not true.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Every time.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   No, I think many people fall for graphics.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   They go crazy over how it looks.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   Yeah, you see the graphics, and you just fall for it.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   However, I think the second game sold is dependent on gameplay.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   Oh, that's a good one.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   Yeah, you're only full-class game.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   Right, exactly.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   Yeah, so a lot of people fall for it.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   But, yeah, on that note, I thought John Woo's stranglehold looked tremendous from Midway, a game from Midway for 360,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   and crisis too.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Both of those games were just killer graphics, but the same gameplay that you've seen many times before.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   So, are they going to sell?
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   Yeah, I'm sure they will.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   But will they be a breakaway hit?
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   No, and I think the other games that are original have the chance to break away.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   Isn't there a good market though now for especially good-looking games because we're starting to see these machines hook up to HD TVs,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   and people want to show off what they've got?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   Absolutely.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   I know games don't look as good on TVs as they do on high-def TVs.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   Right.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   Well, there's also one other element which...
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   There's another element to the HD thing.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   If you have a big projector or something and you run one of these, because we've done this here,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   you run a 360 game through the HD system and you can get a split screen on a racecar game,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   which is actually usable by two players because you can really see something.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   That's true, otherwise it's useless.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   It's useless, and it's too small.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   Right.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.960]   That's an issue anywhere.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   Are any of these machines going to have...
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   What is that, the game length idea where you would have multiple machines and multiple screens
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   and you could play against each other that way?
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.960]   I guess that's what's online gaming really is.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   I think that's what live is all about.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   That's one of the things all three game machines are focused on is this online all the time.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.960]   Well, not only the three game machines, but now Microsoft is integrating PC games against Xbox 360 games.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   I like that idea.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   I think that's a big hit for Microsoft because there's one area where they have a real lead is in PC gaming.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   If they can take that success in PC gaming,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   hook them up with the Xbox 360 gamers.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.960]   I think that makes their market a lot more attractive, don't you?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   Not only...
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   No?
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   Oh yeah, I think far and away, really.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   Shadowrun is the first game that's really going to take advantage of this live anywhere a service
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   so that the controller players can finally play against keyboard or mouse and see who's going to win.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   But it isn't going to launch until later this year because it's dependent on Vista.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   So you have to wait for Vista to come out, get that running, then get Shadowrun, then you can play.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.960]   Oh.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   Well, still Microsoft still has a big head start against Sony specifically for anything online.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   It looks like, I mean, from people who, you guys can tell me if I'm wrong here,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   but according to everybody who looks at this carefully, they say, you know, Microsoft really is set up to do this take advantage of online
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   where Sony is still kind of a cluge.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   Oh yeah, well Xbox has the huge advantage having come from their first generation that had the live service.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   So now they're just building upon that while Sony's trying to catch up.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   Does Sony have anything important to announce? I mean, they had a big price conference.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   Yeah, they did. They announced the price, they announced the date, and they spent an awful lot of time talking about Singstar,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   which is bigger in Europe than it is here because here it doesn't exist.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   What does Singstar?
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   Basically like a more advanced version of karaoke revolution with a lot of licensed music.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   So it's kind of nice if you like that.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   Yeah, I know. I think I've been talking about how the menus, Gran Turismo...
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   It's being sarcastic. Are you really excited?
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   Where is karaoke dead?
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   Actually, that was Patrick Allen.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   How's an Alva gentleman to hold his tongue on that one?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   Al Phyllis sleep.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   Well, dance, dance revolution is huge. I understand what dance, dance revolution is.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   What is karaoke revolution? Is that the same idea you're competing against each other in karaoke?
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   Yeah, it's the same kind of idea. You can actually use a dance pad and the mic at the same time for a revolution party.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   But yeah, it basically just keeps track of your pitch more than the actual notes because a lot of people can't sing,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   but they can still play this game.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   You know that CBS is doing a morning television show called Dance Dance Revolution?
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   You know, I'm actually kind of happy about that because anything that gets kids active and moving around, I hardly support.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   I guess you might be right on that.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   Patrick, do you play any games? I mean, is this completely, is this conversation completely beyond you?
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   I've actually played top of PSP and was so terminally disappointed with the games on that.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   I just gave up on gaming again.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.960]   You know, I had the SP too and I really was excited.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   I thought this is going to be the greatest thing and it doesn't really, I mean, compared to the DS, it doesn't seem to be getting any traction.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   Or is that right?
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   Yeah, that's just the general consensus.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.960]   The price is that maybe that's what's going to kill PlayStation 3. Is it two? What is it? 700? 600 bucks?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   599.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.960]   Jeez.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   I don't think the PSP is...
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   Oh, no, it's QuickToys!
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   It's QuickToys!
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   It's like returns.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   At perfectly timed, I think.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   The PSP of the price of the PSP wouldn't be so bad if you were looking left and right and going, "Look at all these amazing games!"
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   Which is everybody that's got a Nintendo DS is doing.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   But yeah, I have to be really careful with games because I'll sit down and play something and look up and it'll be 14 hours later.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   I'll keep this in mind if you're going to make a game that it can't consume our lives.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   Actually, I want to know, I just looked up some pictures. Is that a wedgie being given his hands way down?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   [laughter]
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   The first thing I wedgie in a first-person shooter goes...
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   As someone who nearly flunked out of college thanks to Al in my sophomore year, I want to know because I'm willing to invest in this one and risk my marriage and my career if I can give people wedgies in it.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   It just looks like fun.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   Well, not only wedgies, but uber wedgies.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   Super atomic wedgies!
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   Super atomic wedgies!
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.960]   Yeah, what we did was look at action gaming and try to take a different approach and not do the same old thing that you've done in the war.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   So everywhere there's violence in a game, we just substituted laughs.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   I think that sounds great.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   It's still the kind of thing where there's a lot of puzzles and challenges and things you've got to figure out.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   Yeah, absolutely, but it's not an adventure game.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   There's no inventory, there's no mix and match, there's none of that stuff.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   It's a detective game, but it's not one where you have to take notes and figure out who's going to come.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   I like a game that's fun to play, but there's stuff going on.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   You have to kind of use your mind, but it's fun.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   Well, we looked around for a genre to put it in and we came up with action comedy because there was no genre.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   So that's what we're calling it.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   We're calling it an action comedy.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   I'm excited about Spore.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   We talked about it a little bit last week.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   I am too.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   That's the game that I'm looking forward to.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   We'll write, of course, the guy who did The Sims, SimCity, really an amazing designer in terms of simulation games is doing this game where you start as a multi-cell creature, actually a single-cell creature you create.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   And then you eventually conquer the stars.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   Did they, Janet, show any more about Spore or talk any more about Spore?
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   Yeah, they had a theater and just showed some amazing gameplay footage.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   You could really see how it just covered.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   The progression is really amazing.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   How you start in this 2D game and it turns into this 3D game and it turns into a pseudo-MMO.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   He calls it a massively single-player online game.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   I'm not sure what that means.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.960]   I love it.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   Well, apparently everyone else who's playing winds up making these contributions to the world.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.960]   So even though your world looks like one thing, it's going to be altered by what other players are doing.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   Oh, that's so basically all of the individual games add up to the gaming environment?
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   Something like that.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   Yeah, I'm still trying to figure it all out.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   I thought it was not at first.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   I thought you built your world and your environment and then you could go off and explore other peoples and they could come explore yours.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   It's pretty far into the game.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   But you're not fighting against each other.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   You're not trying to conquer their world.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   I think you can fight against each other.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   Well, interesting because now you Sam Sway isn't going to come out for a year, right?
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   Right.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   Same thing with Spore now.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   It's sometime in 2007.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   And yet when I look at the screenshots, these things are very advanced.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   What takes so long?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   It seems like Spore especially seems like it's almost done.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   I could think a game like Spore must have some pretty intensive QA to go through just to keep track of everything and all the monsters you can create and all the pathfinding and the motion.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   Well, and more than that, I think the gameplay balancing on that game would be a tremendous project.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   I could see allocating a year's work just for balancing that.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   So the engine may be done, the art and the collateral might be done, but they're still figuring out how the game plays.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   Well, it's all the algorithms that determine whether or not you're being successful.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   Just like in the Sims, you know, there's all those rules that you have to make up as you play.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   That's not graphics, that's not the engine.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   Right.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   That's just balance.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   Wow.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.960]   That's quite an achievement.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   So even as a competitor and a game designer yourself out, you can respect what Will is up to.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   You probably more than many understand what's going on.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.960]   When I first saw that video, I thought he was crazy.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   No kidding.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.960]   I mean, that's maybe a master work.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.960]   Maybe his life work, you know, that's what he's been leading up to all this time.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   I believe that.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   And it's going to ruin my life because like Patrick, I'm going to, you know, of course I can't drop out of school now.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   I don't know what I'm...
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   There was a three or four week period when the podcast production slowed down considerably when I played World of Warcraft.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   I have a feeling the same thing I'd have on Sport comes out.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   It's going to be bad.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   Well, you haven't gotten on the DS's that new brain game that comes on the DS yet.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   Oh, I want to get that.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   Tell me about that.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   That sounds really cool.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   This is going to be everybody's worst nightmare in terms of addictions.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   I'm telling you right now.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.960]   You kidding?
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   Really?
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   Have you played it?
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   Yeah, I have.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   I played it actually a demo version but I got...
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   When Nintendo was doing a dog and pony show, I got to take a run at it.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   And it's finally been released and I have a copy.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   And everybody in the family is like playing it all the time.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   My wife can't get off of the thing if she's on it.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   She has to actually leave the house.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   But she was kind of addicted to Tetris too.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   She just gets into these things.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   Kind of like Patrick, I believe.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   You just get involved in the thing and you just can't stop playing it.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   This thing is supposed to do, of course, is improve your IQ.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   So that's even better.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   You feel like you're actually doing something important?
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   Yeah, you're accomplishing something.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   So I have actually avoided it as long as I can.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   This is for the DS.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   This is not for the Wii or something.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   You know, avoided the DS or avoided the intelligence increase.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   I'm already an idiot.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   I don't need to be shown.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.960]   I don't need to be any smarter.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   It turns out to be kind of me kind of stupid helps a lot in the job I have.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   A writer.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   You know, if you have too much brain, you tend to write boring.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   I need this because I feel my mind is going.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   I feel like Hal in 2000.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   Yeah, we felt that way about you too, Leo.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   But I don't think you're going to find that this is going to be a problematic game for you.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   I'm telling you.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   Have you played it out?
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   I did.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   I found the only way I could beat the color naming thing where they put up the word yellow
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   in blue color and then I'm supposed to say blue even though the word says yellow.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   It was terrible.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   I found the only way I could win at that or not win, but at least get my age down below 80
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   was to turn the machine upside down and unfocused my eyes.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   So if I've been reading the word.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   You're showing your brains there.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   Yes, that is.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   Yeah, there's that trick and then you can also put just a sheet of papers.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   You can only see like a top little bit of the word and not the entire thing.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   Sounds like you were all very good at cheating in this game.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.960]   Well, that's probably part of it.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   My youngest son said that he's got some memory tricks that he's used and has improved his score quite a bit.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   He's down to 30 or something like that.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   But I should mention the people out there who get a hold of this game that when I was looking
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   at it, the Nintendo folks themselves say that almost everybody gets a score of 80 when they first attempt.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   So your brain age is 80 when you start.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   Right.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   And it's not a Bertrand Russell 80.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   I don't believe that.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   But what is?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   More like a Bob Lochasau.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   It's more like a grandpa Simpson 80, I think.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   Exactly.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   Where's my soup?
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   Well, where's my parents?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   Brainage.com.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   So would you say, all right, I'm going to ask it now.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   Should I buy a Nintendo DS just to play brainage?
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   I think you should buy a Nintendo DS because it's really a great little machine.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.960]   Right.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   Definitely.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.960]   Just wait for the DS Lite to come out because it's quite an amazing improvement.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   Is it?
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   Far and away.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   When will that be?
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   I believe it's like June 11th.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.960]   I wish they could have brought it out the same time as the new Super Mario, but they just couldn't meet the quantity so I had to push it back.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   So that will be worth waiting on instead of getting the current DS.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   I think so.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   Just the screen brightness, the battery life.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   I like the new placement of the buttons and the microphone, which was very handy for brainage because you're going to need that.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   See, I had a DS when it first came out and I was underwhelmed.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   My son was underwhelmed so I didn't hold on to it.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   But all right, now there's something for me to play besides Nintendo dogs.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.560]   So Nintendo's back, baby.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.560]   We thought they were history.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.960]   Moving on to the actual tech news of the day, we'll do a soft segue because it is still a game story.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   A judge in San Francisco heard hearings on Friday to overturn California's law against selling violent video games to minors.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   Now this law never went into effect.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   It was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger, supposed to go into effect January 1st, Illinois, Washington State, I think Michigan have a similar law, all of which the courts have thrown out.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   The idea is that if the violence against humans is heinous and atrocious and serious that the game cannot be sold to minors.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   The judge said that it violates the minors first amendment rights.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   When did minors start having first amendment rights against?
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   I'm surprised to hear that.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   I know, especially how is fighting a violent video game free speech?
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   Well, it also to say is somebody who remembers, you know, having free speech issues in his high school before I get a bunch of emails from angry teenagers.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   It's like, there's pretty much there's the Bill of Rights suspended inside of high school.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   They say you can't wear whatever you want on a T-shirt.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.960]   You can't.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   No, of course.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   Anyway, this judge said if the only thing that would keep this law in effect is if there is compelling evidence that video games, violent video games create violent kids.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   And I think actually all the evidence is to the contrary, really.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   So.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   Yeah, I think you guys are confusing school rights with age rights or things.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   But I know that teenagers that have put up websites that have been opposed to local schools or to their school have been upheld under freedom to be interested.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   But now you can't, you're right.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   You can't wear any T-shirt at school because that violates a school regulation.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Right.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   So that's a school.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   So you don't have rights in school, but.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   Yeah, I think you can't play violent video games in school.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   Yeah, well, that would make sense.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   That would.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.960]   Nobody's protecting that right.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   Right.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   All right.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   Okay.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.

[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.

[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   I'm going to go back to the next one.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   If I ever get a sucking chest wound while doing call for help,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   Jen, I will immediately call on you.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   I'll be on that.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   I think she's saying she really doesn't want to be called on.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   I don't care.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   I'm calling.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   Show us what you've taught us.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   I down 911 first.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.960]   Not to take anything away from your medical skills, Jen.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   This is a really a news story.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   I had to comment on the top story in Dvorak's blog right now.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   Dvorak.org/blog.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   The cab driver who's pulled in to do an interview in the BBC.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   What happened there?
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   This is the funniest thing I've seen.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   If anybody who is an anglophile likes to go to England and go to the Haymarket Theatre
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   and watch "Farsas," this is like a classic English farsa that you would be impossible to write.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.960]   Apparently some cab driver from Ghana or some French Congo or someplace
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   was standing out in front of the studio.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   He was going to take Guy CUNY, who is a very famous journalist out of England.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   He was going to take him home after he did the interview because it was supposed to be around him.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   I guess somebody came out and said, "Guy CUNY," looking for him, and this guy waved his hands thinking he was going to pick Guy CUNY up.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   The guy rushed him into the office, put a badge on him, and said, "Guy CUNY," so when Guy CUNY was called up to do the show,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   somebody looked around and saw this guy who can barely speak English and said, "Guy CUNY," and he says, "Yeah, yeah, Guy CUNY."
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   He's going to give a guy CUNY a ride.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   Next thing you know, he's on the stage doing the interview, but you've got to watch the video because when the guy is sitting there,
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   I have a link to the video on my site, you click on it and the guy, he has this crazy look on his face, bites his lip, looks around,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   and he says, "Okay, I'll be Guy CUNY," and he does this interview as an expert.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   They're talking about Apple. Does he say anything coherent?
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   At one point he does, about halfway through, the woman says something, and the guy says exactly, and then he goes on to the internet cafes.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   It's hilarious, but he's nicely dressed.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   The funniest part of this is that guy was in the green room the whole time watching this.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   Oh, my God. Why did he come running out?
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   Apparently it was not trivial to get onto the stage from the green room.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   I think that's live TV at its best.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.960]   As far as I know, we never did that on the screen savers, but it could well have happened.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   Actually, there was one incident.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   There was?
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   Of somebody appearing on the screen savers, it wasn't who they said they were?
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   No, but it's fun to make that joke.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   You just try to figure out who it was.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   So somebody who was on the screen savers a number of times, Adrian Lomo is in the news again.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   He was the, they call him a gray hat hacker.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   Look how easy he was to get in.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   He never had a place of residence.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   He slept on his friend's couches.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   He was always mobile.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   They finally caught up to him.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   They did a plea bargain to one count of computer crimes and got a felony conviction of six months detention in his parents' home in two years of probation.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   Apparently, I didn't know this, but as a condition of probation for a federal crime like that, you have to give them a sample of your DNA, a blood sample, and he's refused to do it.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   Well, he's refused to give them blood.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   He's off.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   He's been willing to do other forms of DNA.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.960]   You can take my hair, but I won't give you blood.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.960]   Right.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.960]   So it's not really a privacy issue then.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   He just doesn't...
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   Well, he's claiming it's a religion issue.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   Basically, it's religious issues against giving blood.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   Well, there are religions where that is considered not acceptable.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   Interesting.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   And why don't they just take a hair?
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   I think the laws that he's supposed to give blood.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   That's how they're supposed to get the sample is by a blood sample.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   The DNA sample is supposed to come from a blood sample.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   So his parole officer apparently filed that he's violated his parole.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   I support him because after all, he's not going to... not likely to commit a crime where DNA evidence is going to become involved.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.960]   Yeah, they just like to build up the database in any way they can so they can have everybody's number.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   You know, my father-in-law had... you can go to commercial services and get DNA analysis.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   And he did this, and he's really excited about it.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   And he sent us all the paperwork, you know, and you can tell who you've got, what you've descended from and stuff.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   But the problem is there isn't a very big database.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   This company can only compare it to other people who have submitted data.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   And they're kind of tied to what the other people have said.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   So my father-in-law, some of his genes match two Israelis.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   And so it's like what you have Arab genes will probably not.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   It's probably these Israelis are from Scotland.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   But they self-identify as Israelis.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   So it's completely useless so I can see why you might want to build a big database.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   Well, I mean, it's an interesting database.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   It was originally the combined DNA index system.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.960]   I think it was called CODIS.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   And in 2004, it was expanded from violent criminals and sexual predators to every convict...
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   all, like all... it was to say, all newly convicted federal felons.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Interesting.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   Including drug offenders and white collar criminals.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   Now, do they take DNA from... if you... served in the armed forces, do they take DNA from all...
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   our servicemen?
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   I would... I mean, I would think that would be helpful in identifying.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   No, but as you... whether they do or not, Leo, I'm sure anyone listening to this podcast will think that's a great idea.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   Oh, I'm sorry I mentioned it.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   You know, I...
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   The dog tag isn't always the only way to identify somebody, right?
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   If it weren't for DNA, I don't think many of the victims of the World Trade Center bombing would be identified.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   Oh, well, that's a real downer.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   It's another depressing story.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   Yeah, did you see... did you see Flight 93?
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   I will not go see that.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   I will not go see that.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   I have... that's just too sad.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   Did anybody see the bird flu movie?
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.960]   There's a movie about the bird flu?
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   Oh, it was like last week or something and they was just apparently... I didn't get to watch it.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   They'd be... every comedy show on TV made fun of the... apparently the thing was just an eludicrous joke.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   So bad.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   Yeah, well, I mean, you know, okay.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.960]   You've talked about the bird flu on the cranky geeks I know.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   Is it inevitable?
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   The story's on bird flu in the blog too, but it's kind of now it's become like so popular to talk about this.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   It's like Killer B's, right?
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   Maybe a little more popular than that.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   You've got the Martin Sargent skewing on the Killer B's concept.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   Yeah, he really went off on Killer B.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   Over and over again.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   Martin is terrified of Killer B's.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   Well, now he's got something else to be afraid of.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   Avian flu.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   Apple's no longer afraid of two things. The Beatles and France.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   Apple won their case in British court.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   The Beatles were suing, saying the use of the Apple logo and the iTunes store infringes the Apple Cores copyright.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   The court said, "No."
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   "No, you're snow."
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   Get out of here.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   They've been nicking poor Apple for years with these chicken lawsuits.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.960]   I'm glad Apple finally won one.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.960]   They won it.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:50.960]   And the judge said, "You know, Apple sells music. The Beatles make music. People know the difference."
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   I think it's about time.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   Apple also kind of won in France with that law, that the controversial copyright bill that would force Apple, among others, to open up their copy protection technologies to competitors, was amended
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.960]   with a way that Apple could keep the copy protection secret.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   According to that.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   Yeah, but it still wants them to be interoperable, but it's allowing them to keep the copying scheme private.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   I don't understand.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   Maybe you only show it like Apple would only show it to Bill Gates for five seconds, and then that would be it.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   I mean, everybody could just go to DVD John because he's cracked all of them.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   Right.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   That's right.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   So I guess Apple will stay in France maybe.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   Anyway, I don't know if that was a, I imagine that was a compromise that Apple had some input on, but...
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   I have understood it was a bunch of lobbyists that got the French to cave in.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   Well, the lobby's from...
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   Apple.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   Apple.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   Right.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   That's what I meant.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   Not a negotiation.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   Not a negotiation.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   They lobbied.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   Wow, this is going downhill fast.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   How about this one?
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   Yeah, we really, we had to come up with some real stories.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   Home recording made legal in Australia.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   You mean it hasn't been?
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   Okay.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   Music fans will be able to legally record their CD collections on the iPods and MP3 players.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   Apparently it hasn't been.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   Which must have been awesome.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.960]   I see you have some blue.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   Let's get them a shock to all the Australian protection laws.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   You can't rip a CD.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   Apparently, there will be new enforcement measures to combat piracy, so it's kind of one of those trade-off bills.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   And they also made parody and satire legal.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   And that's about time.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   No, using copyright material for paring your satire.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   Right.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   Well, it's funny because in theory now, if you ripped your entire CD collection...
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   You go to jail.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   Yeah, and Warner Brothers snuck into your house and found that out.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   They could sue the pejisis out of you.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   You know, it's interesting because I think the record companies in the States also want that to be the case.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   I think they really feel like it should be illegal to rip a CD.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   Well, you know, if they could, they'd get first sale repealed.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   So that would be illegal for you to resell your CDs or anything like that.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   Just keep buying it.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   That's the idea.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   Well, you know, does anybody blame these guys for wanting these kinds of, you know, these kinds of privileges?
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   Well, I blame them because I think...
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   Are we talking about the Australians or the record companies?
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   No, I'm talking about the music.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.960]   And I just...
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   The stories I'm saying is because I'm doing a column that's going to run a PC Mag this week.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   Or maybe it's going to be in the magazine or online.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   I'm not sure yet.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   But, you know, where I'm thinking, you know, over the years you've noticed how everybody likes to point out things like,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   well, gee, you know, the movie business, they tried to ban the videotape recorder.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.960]   And now they make most of their money from the videotape recorder.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.960]   And there's an example after example as how a new technology comes around.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   And it makes them more money, not less, and they should embrace it, right?
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   Right.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   Right.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.960]   Why are we consulting for these guys?
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.960]   If they don't want to embrace this stuff and go broke, fine.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   Because they want to get laws passed that keep us from doing what we want to do.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   Well, what we want to do with their stuff.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   As far as I'm concerned, why don't we just go find a different channel altogether and just leave their stuff to languish.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   Stop buying the Whitney Spears records.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   And here's perked up at allofmp3.com and they yelled out, "John, John, we have a way of doing this.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   Just come to what it doesn't look like."
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   Well, no, I think what John's saying is place like, like, magnitude, where you go and you...
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   These are artists who say, "We're not going to be part of this system."
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   Well, the problem is with all due respect to it.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   I mean, as somebody who owns probably more obscure bands on CD than anybody else in this podcast right now,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   there's times when going, you know, an MB&DO case point led Zeppelin, the Beatles, right?
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.960]   There's a lot of people who aren't going to go, "You know, I'm sure there's an alternative band that sounds just as good as the real thing.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   We substitute Leo LePort's Beatle catalog with...
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   Hold yours, crystals.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   Let's see if he notices the difference.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.960]   Yeah, but the Beatles were then. This is now.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   Well, then and now, I mean, there's still a lot of Beatles albums that come on.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   I bought one Beatles album in my life, John. The yellow submarines, so I could revisit my childhood fascination with that movie.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   Other than that, I don't own any Beatles albums. I don't own any Led Zeppelin albums, but I know lots and lots of people of many ages...
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   I own both.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   Who buy it at both, yeah.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   And I bought the albums, I bought the cassette, I bought the CD, and I've downloaded them.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   I paid them for the same song six or seven times.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   Well, you'll get the next one free.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   Why six get one free?
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Press kit thing and have them send you this stuff for nothing.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   If you're buying that many copies...
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   I don't do that.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   I'm too lazy. I just end up buying it.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   So apparently, Terry Semmel admitted that Microsoft did come to them, come to Yahoo, and offer to buy into the company.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   And furthermore, he says, we turned him down.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   Hostile takeover, Microsoft's got the money.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   Don't they?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   Don't they?
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   They couldn't buy Google, but they could buy Yahoo.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   I don't know what's the market cap on Yahoo. It's got to be pretty high.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   It's not as high as Google.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   You know, is it the Google campus doing a podcast with Chris Tibona this week?
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   That is nice.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960]   Oh, yeah. It's swank.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   And you go into the restaurants and there's incredible food of all kinds.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   They're all these different restaurants.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   And you don't pay. You just get what you want.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   I kept looking for the cash here.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   Well, it's all part of keeping you there 24 hours a day so they can work you.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   Right.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   It's amazing.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   If I were a single guy, I'd eat all my meals there.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.960]   I'd stay there.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   Well, they also was talking to the... they've got shuttles that go everywhere from Santa Cruz, probably to Santa Rosa, driving people to the office and the homes and the homes and the homes and the homes.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   And the campus is just so big that they have little electric motor scooters and all the lobbies of the buildings so you can just hop on one and go to another building if it's too far.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   Okay. Okay. Not to interrupt, but I'm going to interrupt.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   If you took the Google price now, of course, it would run up if you tried to buy them out.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   But the market cap is $43.4 billion. I don't think Microsoft can afford that.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   How about... they can probably buy... they can probably buy 10 or 20%.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   What's Yahoo's net worth?
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.960]   No, that's what I meant. Yahoo.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   Really?
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   Yahoo's $43.4 billion. I'll look up Google net.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   So I don't think Microsoft has enough cash to lay down.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Yeah, but they could buy enough shares to do some interesting things.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   Well, and that's the thing. I think that they didn't say... they didn't say we want to.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   Well, that would run up the price of this stuff. They probably still cost them too much money. It's too expensive.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   Well, you guys, we got me thinking now that I think the wrong career going to tech for a bank, I should be, you know, the search engine business.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.960]   Oh, there's money there, boy.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   Oh, there's money in banks, too.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.960]   Oh, yeah, we carry the money, but we don't get to see a lot of it.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   Well, let me rephrase this. There's a lot more steady employment in banks, and there are at any number of search engine companies.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   I said I didn't say how much of a stake Microsoft wanted or how much they were offering for it. I would have been very interested.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   I got the market cap number for Google.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   What is it?
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   $111 billion.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   Man.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   Oh, man.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   That's what happens to your stock. It's $400. Are you still... still tired?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   It's a lot of $370.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   Is it?
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   Target price is $500 still, Joe?
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   In fact, I still think, you know, I mean, I wouldn't put this in print, but I will, you know, kind of say it.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   There's no way it listens to this, sounds like that.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:24.960]   Well, you know, I've had it... I put in market watch that I thought was going to hit $500, which are my editor question until it started getting up there.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   But I'm not going to put this in the column, but I think $2000 is probably achievable over the next five to six years.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.960]   $2000, kind of for splits, because it happens to split.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   Actually, it would be... Yeah, no, it would be split a few times. You never know.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   But I say $2000, and it actually would... If I was going to put a date on it, I would say probably by late 2009.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   Wow.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   Do you think... Do you agree with those who say there'll be a crash towards the end of this decade?
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   I'm one of the promoters of the crash idea.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   I've got to... In fact, I'm writing it up. I'm going to make a monograph. It's probably sold off the website.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   When is it going to happen, just so I can sell my stock first?
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   It should happen.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   Here's what I just say to people. If the Dow Jones hits $30,000, which it will...
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.960]   Sell.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   ...we think. I mean, I would also say sell your property, because I think this is going to be the beginning of a long downturn.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.960]   And I was looking for an upbeat story.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   But we'll discuss this at length after I finish my monograph.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   You know, that would be a good... Let's do a Twitch special, a triangulation special, something like that.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   I'd like to do that.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   Yeah, we can do that.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   That sounds like a winner.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   Yeah. The stock market crash to come.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.960]   I'm not the only guy saying this. I mean, a lot of people say...
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   But, you know, most people don't take it too seriously.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   But my thing, which I call the insurance bet, I say, "Look, you don't have to believe it."
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   But when the Dow Jones hits $30,000, which doesn't look too likely tomorrow, but when it does, I would be very larry about being in the market at all.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   That makes sense.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   Yeah, so that's just, you know...
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   Here's an upbeat story. Three Australian men who were lost at sea for three weeks.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.960]   They were living on raw squid and rainwater, but they had cell phones.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   The problem is they were too far away for the cell phones to work, so they would turn it on every morning to see if they got a signal.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   They didn't. Finally, they did. They conserved their batteries all three weeks, and they sent a text message to their families who rescued them.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   Isn't that a great story?
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   I love that story.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   The authorities found several kilometers from Murray Island. They sent a helicopter.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   They were treated for significant weight loss, 20 kilograms. That's a lot.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   But other than that, they're fine.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   SMS saves lives.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   SMS and brains. Like reading the story, they were really thinking they had Kansas helmets, so they didn't get sunstroke.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   They made paddles.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   These guys really knew what they were doing out there.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   See, but they got lost in the first place.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   It wasn't funny, though, with their little buckets over their head and using Kansas paddles, but their cell phones, they kept them protected.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   I'm just impressed that they were smart enough to save the battery.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   Isn't that great? I would have called, kept calling, right?
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   No signal. No signal.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.960]   Well, maybe I could play some Tetris online. Anybody want to play Bejeweled?
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:17.960]   I wonder what kind of cell phone they were using. I think the company should find out, or get you to look into it and see if it's there.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   Give it a promotion.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   There's an app for you.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   It's better than on-star.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   That's advertising written all over it.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   By the way, I just saw this story on ours. Technica Sony says the price for the PlayStation 3 is too cheap.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   Yeah, they spent some time defending it before E3 ended.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   We're giving it away.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   Well, if you subtract the cost of a Blu-ray player.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   You know, I guess in a way that's, you know, $600, but you get a high-def DVD player.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   That's the rationalization I'm going to use.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   The rationalization.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   You want to hear the ductible, Al? You're in the business. You got to buy one.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   You know, game machines have always been sold at a loss. So what's the big, what's new?
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.960]   Wait, have you heard, have you read Kudagari Kuduragi's quote on the justification for the price?
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.960]   No, what do you say?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:14.960]   And of course, this is, you know, we don't know what context this was taken in, but for instance, is it not nonsense to compare the charge for dinner at a company cafeteria with dinner at a fine restaurant?
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   It's a question of what you can do with a game machine.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   If you can have an amazing experience, we believe price is not a problem.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   I see the ad campaign now, the PlayStation 3, like dining at a fine restaurant.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   Worth more because of the service.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   Well, that's right.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   It's premium.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   Except for the fact that people don't need a fine restaurant day after day after day.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   Oh, that's true.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   Yeah, this is the best thing that can happen for Microsoft right now, because this makes the premium 360 look cheap.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   That's right.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   I'm still I'm going to get a DS light.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   I've decided because I need I need brain training.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   So, anybody parents that are going to get hammered come, you know, ship date for the PS3.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   Howling, screaming, whining children begging for the next generation gaming console.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   I like to tease Henry.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   I asked him, so come Christmas.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   Should we get you a Nintendo Wii or a PlayStation 3?
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   3 or Wii?
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   Or a herd of goats.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   Yeah, or goats.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   Start your farming empire now.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960]   I'll take the goats, Dad.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   Real estate.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   That's what I want.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   So, the story, Intel touts developing world laptop and they have pictures of it here and there on the Redge hardware segment.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.960]   Has anyone looked at this thing?
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   This is their response to the MIT $100 laptop.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   Yeah, it's a white box design.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   It's a $300 thing with a crazy looking machine.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   You know, the thing that they think they overlooked is that that MIT machine uses that little mechanism that creates a great deal.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   It's a little battery charger.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   It's a hand.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   Well, they basically said, yeah, they basically, Intel's response, they've dropped it.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   They're dropping billions of dollars into bringing the third world onto the net as part of the announcement.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   And they're like, you know, people deserve to have a real computer with a real screen and they're not going to sit there cranking, you know, for power.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   And it's just kind of, it's a total PR contest with the guys in the MIT.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   I can mention of this hand crank, this mechanism which came out some years ago and first appeared on some radios is now available on some flashlights.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   You can get it Costco.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:23.960]   And it's a really good, I mean, I don't know who I've actually tried to track down who actually manufactures this little mechanism.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   It really works.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   It's amazing.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:33.960]   Yeah, but it's one thing to generate enough power to keep a flashlight going, especially something, maybe like an LED flashlight that doesn't have a lot of power demand.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   But cranking enough to keep a notebook running. I mean, you know, this is, you know, maybe you're going to end up with one arm.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   It's twice the size of the other, you know, crank for 20 minutes, type eight paragraphs, try and crank for 20 minutes, you know, log online.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   But what do you crank to get the Wi-Fi to work?
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   So electricity, are you on the net?
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   I know.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   If you're in a place where you don't have enough electricity to run the computer, you kind of wonder what their, what is it, a calculator?
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   What are they doing? What are they doing? What are they not doing spreadsheets?
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   What are they not doing?
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.960]   Probably, yeah, I tell you what they're doing.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.960]   What?
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.960]   Pawn.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   Pawn.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.960]   What else would you do with that thing?
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   And cranked porn.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   I was hoping you were going to say game.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   There you go.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   And then you could use that bigger arm.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   [laughter]
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.960]   Jenna, I'd like to apologize on behalf of the entire team.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   Oh, that's a right-of-mockey player. I've heard it all before.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   Speaking of which, the adult industry, the adult industry welcomes the rejection of the triple X domain.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   And they didn't want a triple X domain.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   Of course not.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   And I guess it was, I don't know who was lobbying with ICANN.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   I thought it was the right-wing anti-pawn activists.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   But in fact, it was both them and the porn sites.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   Why not, John? Why wouldn't they want that?
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Well, because they don't want to be turned into some little arena that they can easily be filtered out, so they can't push their junk on to everybody.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   I wrote it.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   It would have been a land grab for pornography.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   They thought that the pornography would like it.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   I know.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   I know.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   It joins the Family Research Council.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.960]   And I got into a beef with these guys once before, and I wrote about it.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   I discussed this triple X thing for a long time.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   And it's baffling to me.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.960]   It's almost as though this group, this family, there's a couple of them, actually.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   These right-wing family, supposedly family-oriented groups are against the triple X thing.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   And their argument is that, well, that's because then I can just type in anything.xx.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   And you get porn automatically.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   It would encourage porn.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   The porn people don't think so.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   And I don't either.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   Obviously they've never used Google.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.960]   I mean, if you type in sex in Google, you'll find all the porn you want.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   Yeah, it's not as hard to find porn.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   But the people that were for the double triple X, the idea was that if once you establish it,
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.960]   it might take a long time.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   But if you start pushing people into that little niche, then you can do some serious filtering.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   And it just keeps them away from it.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.960]   Well, maybe I'm giving the porn merchants too much credit.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   But wouldn't they like the idea of a red light district where they could go and people who wanted it could see it?
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   Well, if you spent years putting together a highly integrated network to make this stuff available all over the place
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   and the promotions and all the weirdness.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   I mean, imagine how annoying it would be to try to stuff all that under one domain,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   plus having to repurchase your domains, you know, getting into funding battles for all that stuff.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   This is all pretty bizarre.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   Does anyone think they'd give up the domains they have already?
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.960]   No, but I mean, double their overtime.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   You could over with legislation, you can make them give up the stuff that they currently have.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.960]   Because, you know, the pendulum on porn swings back and forth, especially in this country,
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   which we don't even like bare breasts and advertising.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   And so, I mean, that, I think that over time, it would have been a beneficial thing for filtering mechanisms,
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   but it's never going to happen with these do-gooders who are actually, you know, on the seat.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.960]   You know, I don't know why they don't realize if you're on the same side of these pornography,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   they both think the same way about it.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   Something's wrong with this picture. Get a clue.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   One of them's wrong, that's for sure.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.960]   And then, you know, I can't, has voted against the proposal, so once again, it's not going to happen.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   I'm more worried about somebody stealing all my phone numbers.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   You're talking about the latest NSA revelations that in fact...
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   Isn't that ridiculous?
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   The NSA has been recording phone numbers.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   It's interesting because they requested and got the information from SBC Verizon, the big companies,
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.960]   but Quest of all people, one of the smallest telcos, said no.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.960]   I was so proud. I almost wrote a thank you letter to my phone company.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   They said no because they said it didn't go through the FISA court.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   There is a, you know, there's a secret in court and that you have to have.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.960]   I mean, I think Quest did the right thing, but I wonder if there's any coincidence with the fact that the Quest CEO is like,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   you know, turning out to be not the world's most honest person.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.960]   And, you know, they didn't need to have any more of this evidence show up.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   You mean he was hiding his own information?
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   Well, I mean, I don't know. It just seems like a coincidence to me that all of a sudden Quest,
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   which has always been considered "quirced" by people who are up in the Pacific Northwest
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   and are stuck with these guys, that they would be the guys on the white horse, you know,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   telling the government the stuff that it just doesn't make sense.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   You know, on the other side of people saying, "Well, there's no real information here.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   They're not listening to phone calls. They're just getting what number called what other number,
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.960]   and sifting through it, doing data mining."
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.960]   Yeah, you can do a lot of interesting data mining.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   Some years ago, I was in England, and I got a briefing from Interpol showing how they use
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   these phone call mechanisms, where you can just see how it's calling who the most.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   And they could actually put together who was in charge of a mafia organization
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   and who their lieutenants were. You could outline the whole, you could figure out exactly,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   you know, the structure of an organization with phone call records,
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.960]   just who's calling who, when, and how.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960]   Right.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   It does seem like a little bit of an invasion of privacy, but...
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   You know, it's the whole history of the U.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   It's doing, it's really spooky, too, because their whole thing is, you know,
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   they're not supposed to do anything inside the borders of the United States.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   Right, right.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   Well, that's, I think, really, ultimately, I'm not so concerned about privacy,
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   it's just the bypassing the... I mean, there are good means to do this.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   There is the FISA court to completely bypass that and just kind of go ahead and do it.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   This strikes me as a little bit arrogant.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.960]   Yeah, it used to be, I'll do it now, and ask permission later.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   Now it's, I'll do it now, I won't ask permission, and I'll claim that I would...
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   I'll deny it.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   And then when you catch me, I'll say, well, it was my right anyway.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   Well, you know, the big fear, I think, is that people are worried that, you know,
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   that a political organization can get a hold of this data, do the data mining,
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   see who people are affiliated with, who they're calling.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   Right.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   I mean, you don't need the phone calls, you just...
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   You could put together kind of an interesting...
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   Or maybe some guy, you know, some...
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   You saw this, and some senators having an affair, you know, you could use it to blackmail people.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.960]   I mean, this is just not a good thing to allow.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   Word 2007 is going to feature built-in blogging.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.960]   Microsoft jumping on the blogging bandwagon.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   Okay, that's not much...
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   Well, Microsoft takes credit for being the biggest blogging site in the world now,
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.960]   with my space or whatever it is.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.960]   I find it hard to believe.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.960]   What is not...
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   It's spaces...
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.960]   Microsoft spaces.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.960]   Spaces.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   Right, my space is the other one.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   You know, the more I experience my space, the more I realize it's just a thinly disguised marketing site.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   I mean, it's really all about, you know, getting people's information and marketing to them.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   It's kind of bugs me.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   Well, my space is amazing.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   But, you know, Microsoft claims it's got the most blogs and blah, blah, blah, with spaces.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.960]   I don't know, does anybody believe that?
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   I'm kind of happy, true.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   Well, spaces is tied into MSN, right?
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.960]   So all the kids in high school who use MSN to talk to their friends.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   It's different than...
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.960]   It's different than...
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   Put their data in that as well.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   In Canada, they use MSN.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   I don't think kids hear use MSN.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   Oh, man, that's right.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   It's right.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.960]   All my American friends are on AOL.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   My Canadian friends are on MSN.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   My Australian friends are all on Yahoo, for some reason.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   Isn't that...
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   It's a cultural, a natural, natural cultural thing.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   I think MSN is actually very popular globally.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   Not so much here in the States, though.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.960]   So what's this blogging software going to do in Word 2007?
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   I guess you'll write something in Word and then publish the blog.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   I mean, you know, there's software to do that right now.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.960]   It's very easy to do.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   You know, there's a cut and paste mechanism that's available, too.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.960]   (laughter)
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.960]   You know, I think that that's sensible.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   If you're going to have a Word processor, what is a Word processor to?
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   It creates text, and then you have a printer, or you have email,
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.960]   or various ways of distributing.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   It makes perfect sense to publish it to the web.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   It's a perfectly reasonable menu entry.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   I don't know if it's...
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.960]   Yeah, it's called Lame.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   (laughter)
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   You imagine what those entries are like.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   You can't put photos in.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   You can't do block quotes, or can you.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   And you can't do anything that most bloggers want to do.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   Exurps, you know, does it work with their RSS properly?
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   Well, that's true.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   Probably better for a built-in do in R.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.960]   A good place for it is an RSS reader, or other things like that.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Any other stories you guys are talking about?
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.960]   I suppose we should cover net neutrality, and the low Eolus patents,
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.960]   and all that stuff.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.960]   I just...
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.960]   I can't get excited about it.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   I finally got my hands on an HDTVD player.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   And?
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   It's very pretty.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   It's very expensive.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.960]   It's a Linux box, and it runs very slowly.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.960]   We actually show it running on DLTV, on Tuesday's DLTV.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:41.960]   This isn't the Toshiba.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   This is the Toshiba.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   The Toshiba has Linux in it?
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Yeah, it's a Linux box.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   It's like a P4, 512 megabytes of RAM.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   Inside of...
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   It's got a big old fan on the back.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   You're kidding.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   I kid you not.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   Do you describe me as Patrick as a clunker?
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.960]   That would actually...
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.960]   It's saving grace as there's moments.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   I'm a huge fan of the photography and good fellas.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   It's just a beautifully shot movie.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.960]   Wonderful.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   And that was when I was watching it, and there's moments where I was like,
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   "Okay, you've got six times the detail.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   This is neat.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   This is really pretty.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.960]   It's nowhere near as dramatic as the difference."
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   And Blu-ray won't be either.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   It's nowhere near as dramatic as the difference between videotape and DVDs.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.960]   But there's moments where you're just like, "Wow, the video just looks so rich."
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.960]   And then you go $500 for a box that takes forever to boot and forever to load a disk.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   So this thing...
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.960]   This is interesting.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   So in order for them to make an HD DVD player, they basically had to give you a computer.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.960]   Pretty much.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   A pretty powerful computer.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   It has a hard drive?
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.960]   Not that I know.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.960]   Okay.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   Okay.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   Maybe on Tuesday, she'll open up the HD DVD player.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.960]   That'll put some heart attacks on you people.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   DL.tv, if you want to see what's in the show.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   So the OS is running from ROM?
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   I believe so.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   Maybe if it's...
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   I'm pretty sure it's running from ROM.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   You could do a...
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.960]   That's why it sits in like 16 or 32 megabytes.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   But that's probably why it takes so long to boot.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.960]   It's got to load it in.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   Well, it takes a while to read the disk too.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   The density on the disk is pretty amazing.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.800]   The other thing I'll also do is finally get to talk about some of the stuff that's going
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.960]   on with in-phase and holographic storage, which is pretty trippy.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   Yeah, they're getting how much data in a square inch.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   I mean, it's quite a substantial amount.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   It's 300 gigabytes on a single disk and then it's going to jump to 800 gigabytes, I think,
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.760]   in 2008 and then 1.6 terabytes in 2010.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.560]   The current players, though, we show the video on...
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.560]   We did a big thing friendly from NAB and we've shown the...
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.000]   You kind of have to see the picture of it to realize just how big the current generation
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   drives are.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.560]   You put a meter long.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.560]   Oh, well.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.560]   You know.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   It's early days, yeah.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   Yes.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.320]   There's a story that came out just actually yesterday, I think.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:10.960]   I put it on the blog on 514-2006, which is a Met Sushi or Metchustup Panasonic and Sony
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:17.200]   decided to come with a new HD video camera spec that essentially uses normal DVD media
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:23.280]   to record HD signals using MPEG-4 or H.264.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.960]   And when I ran into the story, I thought it was interesting because I've had people
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.480]   say, you know, maybe the whole HD revolution with Blu-ray and HD DVDs is never going to
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.640]   happen because you can already put HD on a regular DVD if you use different encoding.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.360]   Patrick, what do you think?
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.800]   I'm not sure I understood what you were saying.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.840]   Well, you know, you can take...
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.920]   There's a new camera spec that Sony and Panasonic want to do, which is to record on these little
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:57.200]   mini DVDs, regular DVDs, in other words, plus R and minus R, using a MPEG-4 instead of
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.480]   MPEG-2 and you can get the HD signal on there.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.080]   You don't need these fancy discs.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:08.760]   Isn't that what that Microsoft Terminator 3 was, the Windows extreme?
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.640]   It's something actually Robert's playing around with right now.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:17.000]   It's figuring out the best way to record HD content onto a disc for playback, onto a,
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.320]   you know, a rewritable or a, you know, right-once disc.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   But it's interesting.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.320]   I mean, finding players that'll do that, that actually have, that'll scale out to HD
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.520]   is a little more difficult.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.400]   Well, Robert, you know, in fact, is the one who first mentioned this to me because he
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.840]   was on Cranky Geeks, which is another plug.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.000]   It's crankygeeks.com and John, you know, there's Flash there.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.400]   You don't like to have another video.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.800]   I'm not going to bring up the Flash issue again.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.760]   Anyway, he brought it up that, you know, that the, the, the, he fell, although I don't
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:49.840]   agree with this necessarily, but listening to your story about the HD DVD player, maybe
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.920]   he's right, is that what's the point?
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.360]   Why don't we just do it this way, which is now what Sony and Panasonic are apparently
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.760]   designing a system to do?
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.840]   Although they don't, you know, they're kind of, you know, Sony's kind of on both camps
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.520]   because they want to push the Blu-ray, but I don't know.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.440]   I mean, you're starting to make more sense when you start thinking about it.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.440]   Yeah, but what's the amount of time that can be stored on there?
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.480]   How much video are you talking about?
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.440]   One-sided disk stores 20 minutes.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.440]   No, I apparently can't.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.280]   Well, that's the word on that.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   It's the Voreak/blog.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.280]   It's the Voreak/blog.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.280]   It's the Voreak/blog.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   It's the Voreak/blog.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.120]   It's the efficiency of conventional and paid to a one-sided DVD disk and store 20 minutes
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   of high-res digital.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   No, that's good.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   So my move on.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   Yeah, but these are eight-centimeter disks.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.120]   These are a little bitty disks.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.120]   Oh, no.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.120]   These are little bitty disks on these cameras.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   You can do it with a big disk.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.960]   And I think Robert's right is working on trying to-- I guess he's going to do a call
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.720]   or write up on it somewhere.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.200]   Anyway, I just thought that was an interesting story.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.600]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty clear that now that I hear that the Toshiba player is
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.080]   really this big old Pentium computer, I think it's pretty clear that HD DVD, either Blu-ray
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.400]   or HD DVD, is going to be a flop.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.240]   I just don't see it taking off.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.840]   There's so many other alternatives.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.400]   And it sounds better, frankly.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.600]   I just don't see it happening.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:11.200]   But the other thing, this technique of putting HD on a DVD doesn't make up for the fact that
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:15.480]   you can get a lot of gigabytes on one of these new technologies, which computer users
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.720]   need more than I think people who just want to watch HD movies.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.600]   Unless this holographic stuff comes along faster or a really better--
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.120]   Oh, I'm not even believing that.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.440]   Sam Swayde Undercover Exposure is the latest from Al Lowe.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.680]   And it'll be in stores sometime in 2007.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:37.480]   But if you want to see screenshots, IGN has a pretty good review of it from their E3 coverage.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.800]   I thought it was-- is that a good place to look to see the screenshots?
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.800]   Al?
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.640]   There are links from allow.com.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   OK, allow.com.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.240]   There you go.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:55.120]   You could see Swayde giving a guard a super atomic wedgie.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.120]   So there you go.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.520]   I mean, where else are you going to see that?
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.160]   Al Lowe's site is allow.com.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.800]   The cyber joke 3,000 pictures of Sam Swayde.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.040]   And of course, all the old leisure suit larrys.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:14.160]   And incidentally, a clip from the screensavers where Al appeared on our show.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.440]   So that's kind of neat to see that there.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:21.480]   John C. Devorex blog is Devorex.org/blog, where you'll see pictures of Bikini Cloud
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.680]   high school teachers as well as the Naean cab drivers, particularly computer experts.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.880]   Say that three times faster.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   The Naean cab.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.880]   Yeah.

[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.200]   I know I could say that three times faster.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   Yeah, I hate.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   Go for it.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   What was that again?
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   The work that Allowx.org made.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   It was everything.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.440]   Jen Cutter is on open alpha.tv.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.000]   You'll see her also on call from help.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Call from help.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   For help.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Whatever.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   Whatever we call it.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Jen, lead for help.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Lead for help.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Beg for help.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.160]   Jen, thanks for being here.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   I appreciate it.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.880]   It's great to have an update from E3.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:57.840]   And of course, dl.tv, where you can see Patrick disassemble some of the--
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.480]   finest hardware in the world.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   Must enough to place.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   Bust enough to place.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.960]   That's always a lot of fun.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.920]   Guys, we'll see you back here next week.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.240]   Another twit is in the can.

[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   Microsoft Mp3.

[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:35.720]   All right.

[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   That's why we had a dead spot in the middle of that show.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   Oh, I edit those out.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   I'm talking kind of like the boring part you mean?

[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   I think I'll cut that out.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   It's going to be actually a fairly short show because after you cut that out, there's
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.720]   so much left.
