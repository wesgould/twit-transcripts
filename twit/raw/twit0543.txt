[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.960]   I am Leo LaPorte and we first of all want to thank you all for being here for this episode
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.560]   and I presume many other episodes this year.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.440]   Twit is the number one station on the network Twit.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.240]   The number one show I should say on the network Twit.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.920]   It's kind of because it was our first show.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.820]   It's kind of a special place in my heart.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.200]   I love doing it every Sunday afternoon.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.520]   We're always very grateful that people watch in such great numbers and we try to do the
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.120]   best job of the week on the Twit show.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.720]   What we've got today for you is a best of.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.460]   We've done this in years past Jason Howell, worked very hard with your input on finding
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.920]   some of the best clips from 2015.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.760]   We'll be back next week with a brand new full show for you.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.680]   But in the meantime, would you join me in going a little bit through some memories, a
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.400]   little trip down memory lane starting off and you'll see a lot of him in this show because
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.240]   it was kind of his year with Owen J.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:18.480]   Stone and Jason Snell and me and you may notice a little difference in my appearance on this
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   clip.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.320]   Something changed dramatically for me early in the year.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.160]   Also here, Owen J.J. Stone.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.040]   Oh, Dr. From Owen J.J. Stone.com.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.080]   And he's got some shaving cream.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.000]   Actually you're on for, well, you're on because we love you because you're great.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.440]   But we're also on to give me some advice because so we did a, you may know, we did a 24 hour
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   broadcast, great success on New Year's Eve to, we call it the 24 hours of 2015, second
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.480]   year in a row we've done it in which we say happy New Year and every time zone, all 27
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.320]   time zones in those 24 hours.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.440]   In fact, we had collars for many of the time zones.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.240]   It was great fun.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.280]   But what we did differently this year was we were raising money for UNICEF.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.840]   I think a really great cause, United Nations Children's Fund helps kids all over the world
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   who need inexpensive things like mosquito nets, more elaborate things like education helps
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440]   kids be safe from violence and exploitation.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.320]   Really a great cause, charity navigator ranks them among its highest charities.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.920]   That's why we wanted to use it because it was global.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.040]   So everybody who's watching all over the world can get behind it and because it is such a
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.960]   really well run charity.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.560]   But we, and we had planned, we thought we'd raised 20,000.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.640]   That was our goal in the 24 hours.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.560]   It was, you know, I just, I thought, well, this is the first time we've done it.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.920]   We have really no idea, but let's say 20,000.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.320]   Jeff Jarvis, who's, you know, of course the wonderful host of this week in Google, very
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.960]   kindly said, well, let me get things started.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.200]   I will, I will shave for the first time in 42 years.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.120]   I will shave my beard if you raise $20,000.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   Amazingly, we raised $20,000 before noon.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.760]   So, so Jeff kindly let me shave him his beard, which I did a terrible job.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.400]   He had to go back and fix it up.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.640]   But then that, and this is my, I'm saying this is an excuse because then I got swept
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.840]   away and I said, well, if we make first, then Sarah Lane pitched in.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.120]   She said, if we get to $30,000, I'll sing, I'll care.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.600]   I'll sing my, the song I hate more than any other song with a passion, a bare naked lady's
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.400]   one week.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   And she did.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   We, we didn't.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   She did.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   I have to, I have to end it up.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920]   I have to pony up.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   I have to participate.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.160]   So I said, if we make $40,000, I'll shave my head.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.920]   And if we make $50,000, I'll, and this I thought there's never going to happen.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   That's safe.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   I will get a tattoo.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:52.200]   And you see those of you watching a video, I'm padding, padded part of my anatomy.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   That's where the tattoo went.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.360]   So yeah, we got $40,000 and ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing left up top.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.240]   And, and we also got $15,000, $50,000.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   In fact, we ended up, in fact, you can still, you can put us over, I think we're well over
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   70 now.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.960]   If you go to unicefusa.org/twit, we're at 61,000, but there's more than 10,000 from
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   our auctions.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   So we're well over 70.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   I'd love to get even higher.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.360]   We're going to keep that site open if you'd like to help out unicefusa.org/twit.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.320]   So I had to actually, initially we had my, I had my clipped and a number of people said,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   you know, that's not shaving.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.360]   No, you're full of Lex Luthor now.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.880]   I am, I am Lex Luthor.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   I am.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   You're co-jacking it.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   I am the one who knocks now.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   Yep.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.880]   And now I understand.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.920]   So, Owen, you're here to help me to give me advice because you, I prefer to call it
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.520]   black bear and polar bear.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.280]   If you were only here, I wish you were, man, the best, the best part is we could like
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   rub our heads together and create static electricity.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.520]   Frictions.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   Something would happen.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520]   Something explode.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   How long have you been balled up there?
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.320]   I've been shaving my head since I was 23.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.920]   I don't know how old I am now, but it's probably like 10 years or so to a 10.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.120]   I am googling.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   Last night I'm googling.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.640]   First time you shave your head, what you did.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   I'm googling.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   I know.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.440]   Some people come up and want to rub your head.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   Like cause it's worse when it was, it was worse when it was kind of short than it was
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.160]   like a little teddy bear and everybody, everybody wanted to rub it.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   Now it's a little scratchy.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   It's like, it's like.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Number one grit.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   Oh yeah, it is.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   It's a little sandpaper.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.680]   And then well, in two weeks it'll be soft and fuzzy again.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.680]   It'll be a little teddy bear.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.280]   Well, that's what I'm counting on.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.520]   Cause this, unlike the tattoo, and I did get a twit tattoo on my behind, unlike the
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.040]   twit tattoo, this will come back, I hope.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   What if it doesn't?
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.560]   Well, then I'll be you.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   I'll just grow, I'll grow used to it.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.560]   I did, I was freezing last night.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.920]   I realized that you need a cap.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.000]   Do you wear a night cap?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Yeah, I have hats.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.360]   I have to wear a hat.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   And when you go outside.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   I wear a night cap.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.840]   I'm going to wear a night cap, dude.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.200]   And I think frankly now this is for the first time ever this pork pie hat looks good.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.960]   This was, this was, you know, this is the breaking bad look.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.400]   I need to grow a goatee.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.040]   So now I decide I'm like a shave either.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.840]   I'm just as long as I'm scritchy.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   I'm going to let it all be.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   I'm going to let it all grow out.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.160]   See, we'll have a race.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.000]   See what grows faster.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.400]   See what grows faster.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.760]   My beard or my head.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.600]   I'm going to be all even and he can turn into a wildebeast man.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.480]   Anyway props to those of you who do this every day because I did actually go down to
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.080]   the boulevard barbers and they, they are very good.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.160]   They knew exactly what to do.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.960]   The barber there, Sarah used a straight racer on me.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.880]   Have you ever used a straight razor?
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   I've had it done.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   I've never used one myself.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   I am terrified.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   I wouldn't do it myself.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   I have a very, very eloquent old gentleman that opens his barbershop like three o'clock
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.680]   in the morning and I go to him and he does it and I'm just scared when I'm sitting there.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   But it feels amazing.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.280]   It is the best kind of shave.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   It was great.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.320]   She used essential oils, orange and stuff and just scraped it.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.600]   She made you feel special.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   But I'm not, that's it.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   I'm done.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.760]   I'm growing it out now.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.000]   I don't think there's any rule that I had to keep a frame like the time.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.560]   That's, that's totally fair.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.200]   I'm humiliated now sufficiently.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.240]   So without all your don't get a haircut and then donated it to end of the year.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   Start all over again.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.880]   So here's something very exciting.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.280]   Sony Walkman, big banner out front of the CES Hall.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   Sony's bringing back the Walkman for CES.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   Is it, is it like Zoon's older cousin?
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.720]   Well they do, they did a Walkman.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.120]   We had it for review on before you buy this year that does HD tracks, which is nice.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.960]   It does the high res music.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   I don't know.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960]   This does.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.480]   As you can see there on the left a gold headphone jack.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.280]   It, I don't.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.720]   And there's the Walkman logo, isn't that great?
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.200]   Unless it's super small and it fits on like my wrist or my shoulder for the gym, what
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   is the point?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   I have a phone.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   Yeah, I don't know what the point is.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   My phone plays music.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.360]   Every phone plays music.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Right.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.920]   That's why, that's what happened in the iPod.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   Exactly.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   So what is the point of this and why did you do it?
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.600]   I'd rather you bring out a tape deck and do something nostalgic for me as opposed to
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   that.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.800]   What's funny is that Sony does make phones, right?
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.360]   I mean it's not like they don't have the Xperia.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   Here's the video.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.880]   They're making pretty cool phones.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.320]   This is called Welcome to the New World.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.040]   And she's writing in an elevator, but the elevator is going up and she's licking a lollipop.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.000]   Wait a minute, is that Android 5?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.440]   But no, here's music and sound.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   And then there's a lizard.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   Five.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   Millions.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   Shadows.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   Hands.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   Rainbows.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   Double rainbow.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   Iris.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   Eyeball.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   Eyeball looking.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.400]   What's the eyeball seeing?
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.800]   It looks like a Walkman.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.960]   Now she's smiling.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.720]   Now her hair's standing up on her arm.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.280]   Oh my God, she's crying.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.680]   It's so beautiful.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.120]   That's a giant belly and a small child that used to be his home.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.720]   Now he lives in a curtain.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.160]   Welcome to the New World.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   Sony.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.840]   I think we just got programmed to kill ponies.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.240]   I don't know what that video did.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.040]   That was a college student.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   Oh my God.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.240]   What did that video did?
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.920]   Absolutely nothing for me, but maybe hate Sony in the back of the end of a Sony on it.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.400]   Like you put a small child on a baby's belly.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   That was only a nice thing in that video.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.960]   I had to feel some kind of redemption in my heart.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   Just stupid.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   Who paid for this stuff?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   Call me Sony.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   Sony pays a lot.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.160]   I was going to say this is that video proves JJ's whole theory about how our world is about
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.720]   to come to an end actually.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.400]   That's a little portrayal of the machine control teacher we all can look forward to.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.000]   I really feel like something bad should happen.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.360]   I feel like I just got programmed to do something.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.160]   Like there was a little message in there.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.880]   Oh, and you're just doing a rush for kicking ponies.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   Shake your head.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   Okay.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   Just like that.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Well, you guys are more susceptible to the brainwave.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   Shake your head.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   Mind control.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.360]   You're the only guy with hair on this show.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   That's right.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   I'm scaring the children now.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   That's what I looked like with hair, by the way.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.040]   If you go to stamps.com, click the microphone on your tweet.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.960]   You'll see what I look like with hair.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.560]   Gosh, it was a nice head of hair.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.880]   Can you just digitally take that and drop it on top?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.600]   Nice head of hair I gave up.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   Wow.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.840]   Do I look like a different person a little bit?
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   Yes.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.200]   You look like a different person a lot.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.240]   It's like ballmer.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   Steve Ballmer.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   I was going to say.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.640]   I was going to say sling blade.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640]   Ballmer is probably a much nicer comparison.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   Sling blade.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   Thanks.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   I was going to say telesavales.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   This is the other thing I've learned after I shave my head again for charity for good
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   causes.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.000]   Growing back, I'll never do it again.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Disclaimer.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Is it you can tell how old somebody is precisely by who they say you look like.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.040]   If they say you look like curly from the three stooges, they're 80.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.040]   If they say you look like telesavales, 30s, 40s.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   If they say--
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   I say ballmer.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   This doesn't make sense.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   This doesn't work.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   Okay.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.040]   Ballmer is a special case.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.800]   That's what the geek might say.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.360]   If you say Uncle Fester, 50s, right?
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.640]   If you say, oh, you're Heisenberg from Breaking Bad, it's a young person.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:19.440]   If they say pit bull, I understand that say rap performer.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.940]   If they say pit bull, then--
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.800]   You look like pit bull.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.880]   You know who pit bull is.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   I do.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   Oh, you do.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   You know what?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   You actually do.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   If they say pit bull--
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   Timber.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.400]   Jason, picture of pit bull, please.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   I hope we could just cut you open a couple of rings.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   You open a couple of rings.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   Burf wannabe says--
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   You look like my dad.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   All right.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   I think-- so really, the issue was I shouldn't have used the mustard.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   There you go.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   Yeah, you could have--
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   Can you say the bigger they are, the harder they fall?
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   Bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   Just like that guy.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   Wow.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   You need a little-- you need the sole patch and then go back.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   Wow.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   I need to go too.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Whoa.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   That's actually uncanny.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Yeah, you do need the sole patch.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   You need the sole patch and the douche bag.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   Don't do that.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   [laughter]
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   Never smile.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   Oh, and a tie.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   And a tie.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   Because he's such a well-dressed guy.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   He is a well-dressed guy.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   I've been stalling because I want to wait until the-- oh my gosh, until the game finishes.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   And I think it just finished.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   I think it's my guess.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   It's my guess.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   It just finished.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   So we can now welcome-- are you a Seahawks fan or a Packers fan, Ben Thompson?
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   I'm a Packers fan and it's not over, but Seattle just took the lead.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   It's a-- it's a minute 25.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   Yeah, it's not over.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   In fact, you probably won't be with us for another couple of minutes.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   Well, actually, I don't have it on-- it's not on TV here.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   Oh, all right.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   It's more muddling along with the-- can we point a camera at the-- we kind of figure-- because
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   I got to do this without violating NFL rules, but I think we could feed you our video
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   and then you'd really be distracted.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   I could stream-- I mean, I could find ways to stream it, but that would ruin the stream.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   But--
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   We should mention that Ben Thompson, of course, has Trateccari, which is the best, most insightful
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   independent tech blog I know of, is in Taipei, Taiwan.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   So--
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Yes.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   And it's certainly in the morning.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   And agonizing through the end of this game here.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   Yeah, I didn't know you were packing a little-- it's looking a little grim right now.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   I wouldn't have booked you.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   You know what?
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   You got Aaron Rodgers.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   He's got a great two-minute drill.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   I think it's not over till the linebacker sings.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   Yeah, I was at the Times, actually.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   And I think I must have mis- calculate the Time Zone because I was sure it'd be well over
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   by now, but that's fine.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   That's quite--
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   Well, you're not watching.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   What are you watching?
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   Like a text-- are you somebody texting you the score?
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   No, I mean, you could follow the game--
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   She gave you the slave-- oh, yeah.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   And NFL.com, they have kind of a--
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   A thing, yeah.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   I'll give you a play-by-play.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   No, I mean--
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   So now a big guy in the black outfit is-- it looks like he's wearing tights, I'll have to
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   say, and he's kicking the ball.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   It looks like he did all the way down to the other end.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   So that's good, right?
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   And then a guy's running with it, but they-- oh, my God, they're hurting him.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   And then--
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   That's slightly ironic.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   That's slightly ironic.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   So Aaron Rodgers has 12 game-winning drives and 37 opportunities.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   He's 32% for this particular situation.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   But I'll tell you, there are not many quarterbacks in the NFL.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   You'd rather have there.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   I'll tell you what, Ben, you keep watching the game.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   There we go.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   We have the footage now.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   I dialed in some--
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   A feed.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   Direct from--
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   Very exciting.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   Number one is running around.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   He's really exciting game, I have to say.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   Number two is in a fist fight, it looks like.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   But he's falling down now.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   And now number one's running around in a circle.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   He's actually--
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   Wow.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   --dislike to go back the other way.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   The most crazy number.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   Number two is again falling down.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   That's terrible.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   Number one's just running back and forth and forth and back.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   It's terrible.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   I think that's Russell Wilson, isn't it?
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   Oh, just the humanity.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   This is cruel here.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   He's just playing with the others.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   Touchdown the court.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   It's the classic.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   Yeah, it's the tackle pole.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   You-- you-- Bo Jackson, you basically see if you can run the entire quarter.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   Oh, that's interesting, really?
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   This is an old classic and--
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   Is it Atari Sega?
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   What is that?
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   Now, this is a-- this is Nintendo.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Yeah, Nintendo.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   Yeah, Nintendo.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   So the idea is you just keep running until they tackle you.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   Bo Jackson was basically unstoppable in this game.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   And so, yeah, the goal was to do a running play on the first play
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   and then see if you could run out the entire quarter.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   [laughter]
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   And I guess this is a speed run because--
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   Yeah, Bo Jackson, touchdown.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   There you go.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   Bo knows football and baseball.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   Oh, boy.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   Where do I see those great?
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   Is it Mitzmunk bet on-- on Instagram?
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   Those pictures of the amazing stuff you get to eat.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   Oh, I'm jealous.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   I know.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   Look at this.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   Ooh, good scolch as well.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   Oh.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Oh.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Pure malt, Nikka Whiskey.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   21-year-old-- That's a Japanese one.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   That's quite good.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   Ooh.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   Ooh.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   Yeah, Monkbend is-- Ben's handle on Twitter and on Instagram
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   and if you want to-- is that a chicken foot you're actually
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   biting into there?
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   It is a chicken foot.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   Oh.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   Tasty?
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   It is-- it is good.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   I'm not-- I'm not-- like, some people are just massive fans.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   I'm-- I'm not going to go out on that way for it, but it's good.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   Crispy?
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   No, it's very-- it's very soft.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   It's very soft.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   That's actually why I don't like it as much.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   I find it too soft.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   It's good to say surely if you're reaching chickens' feet.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   That's a sign that somebody else has stolen the rest of the chicken.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   I mean, there's just like--
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   It's always left.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   I mean, we had-- we had-- we got some-- got some barbecue last night.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   We're one of the-- one of the best things is chicken butt,
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   where you have a skewer and you have like four or five of them right on there.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   There's-- it's-- I mean, think about it.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   It's very muscular.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   It's-- it's good.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   It's really good.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   I'm trying really hard.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   So what's this--
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   There's a tiny bit of gristle in there, which is a little disturbing.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   Oh.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   Oh, suddenly I'm not hungry.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Way to kill the back-type.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   Yeah, save them for later.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   Ooh.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   We got a great group from Canbera.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   It's the-- what's the name of the school?
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   Canbera?
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Grammar school.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   That's in Australia, right?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   They came all the way from Australia.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   About 20-- 20 nice young men.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   And they've been here and they've been very quiet and very peaceable.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   Except when-- except once.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.400]   I said, "Aussie, Aussie."
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.400]   Boy.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   Boy.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Boy, you guys are terrible.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   You have just shamed all of Canbera.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   Let's try that one more time.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   Boy.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   Boy.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   Yeah, that's more like it.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   Anything?
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   No one knows.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   Showing your support for Australia.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   Showing your support for Australia, which is a good thing, I think, right?
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   Oh.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   Oh, and JJ Stonehulled is your daughter?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.400]   She is seven.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   She is the internet?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   She's on the internet?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   Yes, she's all over the internet.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   What do you do to protect her?
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.400]   Um, I have her on all Apple devices that I can look on my phone and see what web page
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   she's gone to.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   So you keep an eye out?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   Yeah, anytime she takes a picture on her cell phone and backs up to her.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   And sometimes she's on her iPad and backs up to me.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   That's not going to work much longer.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   You know that, Josh.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   How old is she?
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   She's seven.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   So let me tell you about the world that I live in.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   Wait till 17, forget it.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   17, wait till 12.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   Look, dude, I'll tell you what, I'll be doing so much espionage.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   When I was a kid, my dad used to sneak in my room, he put a little green film over a flashlight
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   and go on and look through my notebook and my journal and be reading the middle of the night
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   like I didn't see him doing it.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   I'm going to be spying on her so bad.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   She's going to wish and say, "We're coming here and slowing me down."
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   I love to say whatever you want.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   My daughter's in jujitsu.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   She's a biker.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   She's a basketball.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   When she goes out on a date, they're going to be like, "Mrs. Storm bring back a 9/30."
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   You going to come on what you want to.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   She's an international spy and then she will break your neck.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   I'm going to be all up in her grill.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   So I'm not worried about safety.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   Because these other kids we got worried about on the 3DS and the computers, the parents,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   it's all about paying attention.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   And I'll be paying attention.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   I agree with you.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   Just a computer.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   And you'll be wearing those shades.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   You'll be wearing those shades.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   I hope you had a great holiday season in your Hanukkah, your Christmas, your Kwanzaa, your
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   winter solstice.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   I hope you have a great new year as well.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   And we're going to kick off the new year next week with brand new shows.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   But we have some more highlights from the year past.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   Just a bit.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   But first, I want to thank Squarespace for being such a great sponsor.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   Not just for 2015, but frankly for many years on the network.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   And I'm glad to.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   This was the year that I'm finally listened to my own ads after doing it for years.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   We've used Squarespace for many things, including our inside-trip blog forever.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   But I had never moved my personal website to Squarespace because I thought, oh, I got
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   to know how WordPress works and other blogging platforms.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   And finally, I just got tired.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   I just got tired of the constant security updates.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   It turned out was spending more time on my blog updating it than I was putting content.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   And so this is it.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   This is my new Squarespace site at leoville.com.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   And I took advantage of a Squarespace feature I love, which is the cover page.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   Here are me and Jeff and Gina at Google I/O a couple of years ago.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   Wedding pictures are there too.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   And I love that cover page feature.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   But I also have my blog there, my photo blog.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   Squarespace is a great way to share your life, to share your business, to put up an online
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   store.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   And in every case, it just looks gorgeous because Squarespace is designed so you can build it
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   beautiful.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   You can reflect your personal aesthetic.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   You're going to start with these professionally designed templates.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   I almost hate to use the word templates because really what these are is just starting points
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   for you.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   They have design features.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   They all have e-commerce built in.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   And every one of them uses state of the art web technology, things like mobile responsive
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   designs to your site looks great no matter what size screen it's on.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   These are things that would be very hard to do yourself.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.400]   Squarespace makes it easy.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   And of course, if you want to get geeky, there are hundreds of options, customizing
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   settings, fonts, colors, page configurations, even a developer platform where you can do
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   your own HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the like.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   So Squarespace is kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   A great site for something like me just wants to put up content.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   A great site for web developers who want to do more, control more.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.400]   And you always get such a great looking site that's totally unique.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   And that's important too.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   That's why I don't like using the word template.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   This is not a cookie cutter.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   This is a, this, this site, every site looks different.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   Every site looks great.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   And in no case can you say, oh yeah, that's obviously a Squarespace site.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   It's obviously your site.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   That's what you want.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   Power your business with these, with e-commerce from Squarespace.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   Squarespace commerce is the only platform that lets you create, manage, and brand your
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   store in a beautiful way.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   It doesn't look like a cookie cutter store.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   It looks like your site.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.400]   Basic plan available advanced plan too with additional features like shipping.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   Plus incredible 24/7 customer support.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   If you're a musician, a restaurant, a business, they've got a template for you.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   Squarespace.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   Look, it's easy.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   Just go to squarespace.com and get started.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   It costs you nothing.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   The free trial doesn't even require a credit card.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   So you can really see what's there.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   You can even import some of your own content to make sure that site's going to look like
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   you want.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   And if you decide to buy all I ask is to use a promo code TWIT, you'll get 10% off.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   And Squarespace will love us a little bit more.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   We like that too.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   squarespace.com.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   10% off when you use the offer code TWIT, but try it for you right now.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   Squarespace.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   It's the best place.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   To build it beautiful.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.400]   I love Squarespace.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   Let's continue on some of the best stuffs.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   This was one that got me a little bit of trouble Steve Kovac, Jason Snell, Ben Thompson.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Ben and I got a little fight because I happen to like Android better than iPhone.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   In fact, I even said something I might regret later that it's objectively better watch.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   Apple probably also gets a pass from journalists who are unwilling to say be too strongly
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   critical of it because you don't want to look like an idiot when the thing sells so well.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   That's not getting a pastel.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   That's being totally rational.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   I mean, the reality is that I mean, I think I was on before the iPhone Leo.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   I think you were being super skeptical of the sales or was one of your best things.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   I mean, the idiot who keeps saying that.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   Right.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   I mean, and like, and fortunately most of the time you have like people like me coming out
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   reminding you of it.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   No, I don't mind because I don't, I honestly don't think that the iPhone is a better device
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   than for instance, the Galaxy S6 Edge knocks the iPhone all over the place in so many ways.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.400]   But that doesn't have to anything to do with why people buy the iPhone apparently.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   And the same thing with a watch.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   It has nothing.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   It's like what you value in a phone is different than what what no, I think a lot of consumers value.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   I think anybody with an objective mind would say, Android is a far superior choice.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   I'm not even getting into this right now.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   That's good objectivity.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   I like to see your dictionary later later.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   That's objective.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   If you look at the two and you didn't, if you came from Mars and you didn't know any of the history
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   and you looked at it, you say, well, I don't understand why people are buying iPhones.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   Why would you buy an iPhone?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   That thing is constipated as hell.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   It's not it's a great, you got a grid of icons.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   It's very, it's horrible.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   I don't like the problem with this perspective, Leo, is the implication of that is that there's a lot of people who are dumb in the world.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   And I'm not saying it does.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   No, you are though, because you're saying, obviously, this is better.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   Why do these tens of millions, hundreds of millions of idiots keep buying and inferior product that costs more?
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   Well, that's I'm not saying that because that's pretty that's an insulting thing to say.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.400]   Well, yeah, you're not saying people are not stupid.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   They're for whatever reason they're buying into.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   Look at people bought Windows for years, even though it was a horrible operating system.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   But that's what you bought.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   That's what everybody bought.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   You buy a PC, you're going to buy Windows.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   You buy a phone, you're going to buy an iPhone.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   It's just the default.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   It's not that they're dumb.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   It's they don't have time to figure out which is better than go with the default.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   No offense to Jason, but you were dumb to buy a Mac in the 90s.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   Maybe the night there was a bad.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   No, I agree.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   OS 9 and so forth.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   Those were dark times.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   Even the odds.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   I mean, like the reality is, is until the internet came along and most of our applications moved to the internet, you, there was just lots of stuff you literally could not do on, on a Mac and eat user experience aside.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   And that was changed with the internet, which made it, which removed that kind of like gate.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   Like there's there's there's two different things when it comes to features.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   One stuff is like it's a reason to buy and then there's stuff that's a reason not to buy.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   And the reason not to buy if you have it there, it's devastating.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   Like Windows Phone, for example, like not having a competitive set of apps and even if you have apps you do have, they're all inferior.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.400]   That's a reason to not buy.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   It doesn't matter how good user experience is, how, how, how, it is to use or even if you use all Microsoft services.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   You're not going to even consider it because there's a gate there.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   And that was the same thing when it came to, when it came to the Mac.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   And to say that people were buying Windows because they were sheep, I think that's insulting to people.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   The reality is is people, most people aren't tech people.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   They're not sitting around weighing the stuff.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   They have stuff they want to get done.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   And people, and in my experience anecdotally, but normal people who aren't trying to call it all,
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   consistently find it's easier to go about their day and it's less frustrating.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   And they can do what they want to do more easily and consistently on an iPhone.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   And I agree with you in the 90s.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   That isn't true though after say 2005, 2004.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   I mean, but there's a lot of momentum and people continue to buy Windows and it's still a 95% operating system.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   So that's my point.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   No, you're right in the 90s.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   There was no question.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.400]   I'm not talking about the 90s.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   Fair enough.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   But, but, but, but, but, well, I mean, you're the one that brought up the analogy.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.400]   Well, but I, but you're the one who said is the 90s.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   I'm saying, let's say 2000, let's say 10 years ago, 2005, that Windows sold out of momentum more than anything else.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   Windows Vista, so, or Windows XP sold out of momentum compared to a Mac more than anything else.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   Well, I mean, 50% of the market, sorry, I, I'm, I'm, like, being rough nearly a little.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   50%?
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   No, no, no, no, no, that's fine.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   It is the enterprise market, which again, there remains very good reasons to buy.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400]   I agree.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   And enterprise, absolutely.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   I agree 100%.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   I'm talking, I'm not talking about enterprise.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   I'm talking about enterprise.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   And in the consumer market in the US, Apple is up to, I don't know the exact numbers, but it's, it's, it's not far from 50%.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   It's getting there.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   Like, they are crushing.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   Yeah, the momentum, momentum doesn't last forever.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   We live in a world with friction.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   We're not in space.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   But the problem again with analogy is the momentum is in favor of the iPhone.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   So, I mean, I have more people getting dumb over time.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   Does that mean it's better?
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   Is that, is that, does that?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   Well, I think it's a silly argument.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   You like what you like.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   But I don't, I think just because something sells well doesn't make it better.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   No, I think that's true.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   But I, you know, again, I think objectively you could see that there are, for different people, different operating systems and platforms could be a value to them.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   And I don't think an alien that came down from outer space would necessarily look at the, at the Android ecosystem and say that is clearly better.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   I think that it would depend on what the, that aliens personal preferences were and how they wanted to use their phone.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   And because I look at the Android, also we got to say the difference between a platform and a product where the iPhone has used the Galaxy S6.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   Well, I think, I think you could argue that the Galaxy S6 is one of the few.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   And in fact, as Ben mentioned, Samsung changing its approach and pulling lots of features out of the Galaxy in order to create a product that by all accounts is way closer to what Apple has been doing with hardware and that, and that people really like it.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   But a lot of these products aren't there. A lot of the Android experiences aren't that good.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   And so, you know, it's not just the operating system platform. It's also the hardware and Apple has excelled at that for quite a while now.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   And only now are we seeing some Android phones that can match it.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   The first screensavers wasn't the first screensavers.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   First, what we called it the revenge of the screensavers, I think you may remember.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   But the first one was just sitting around after a Mac world at a brew pub chatting.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   And you saw that picture, Jason, because somebody tweeted the picture to David Prager of the group.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   Now, you may notice there's one person missing from that group missing here today.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   And that's Kevin Rose, who was going to be here.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.400]   Had to get on a plane, couldn't make it. He has sent a video greeting, which we'll play a little bit later.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   But look how fresh-faced Kevin looks. He looks so young there.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.400]   Roger Chang, that's Patrick Norton's hair sticking out.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   That's where you left it. You might want to check.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   He's still lovely Sarah Norton to your left, David Prager and me.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.400]   And I had a recorder, and I was very spontaneous. I didn't plan it. I said, "Hey, let's just talk."
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   We talked for 20 minutes. 30,000 people downloaded that episode.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   And I thought, "Boy, it'd be great if we..."
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   It was 30,000 people in the first day. And then it got up to like 130,000 in the third weeks.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   Yeah, you were like, "I think we have a thing here. We have a situation."
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   We've got to do this. But you were all in different places, and it wasn't... Kevin was in LA.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   And it just wasn't practical to do a show. And then I think it was on the radio show a couple months later.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   Somebody called him by a Skype. I said, "Wow, that sounds good."
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   What if a light went off? We could do a show and everybody would be on Skype.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   So it was April... It was in April of 2005 that I said, "Let's just try this. We'll call it..."
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.400]   We didn't have a name. The revenge of the screen savers.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   I have a list of things. You weren't here, John. But you came soon after.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.400]   But I thought... I was snubbed.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   You, Patrick, decided you were leaving Sprint for Verizon.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   Who's your carrier now? 18T.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   Yeah, so you... I was on Verizon for a whopping three months because I moved into a hole in the outer sunset of San Francisco
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   where Verizon did not work. I had to walk two blocks to use my phone.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   Verizon seems to be getting worse around here. I don't know if it's worse in San Francisco.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.400]   Kevin said he hated his trio 650. That was his phone.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   That was kind of the first smartphone, I think.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   Is that the one that had the lid that flipped?
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   It was the first one that had keyboard.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   It had a keyboard and it was kind of like a device where you could walk the test.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   It was running POMO, I said.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   It was like a POM pilot with a keyboard and CDMA radio.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   He said he wants better screen resolution and a better camera. There it is.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   It looked funny.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.400]   That looks like a flag now.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   That's on Sprint.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   Everybody was excited for Verizon VCAST.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.400]   I don't even remember that.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   What was that?
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   I think they were going to do streaming TV on the phone.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   It was like a media. It was some sort of streaming media.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   It was their horrible, like, you know, the antenna or the screen would flip out of the phone and be able to watch television over Verizon's network.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   It was a good word.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   Robert Herron said, "I'm using Next-Tell."
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   Oh, man. I don't like the chirps sound when you pushed the talk.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   I missed that. You lived on it.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.400]   You lived on it.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   That worked really well.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   You know what? They ended up donating that phone to a good cause.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   It went...
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   You remember it?
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   It was the first color display I had on a phone.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   What was the tax write-off you took?
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.400]   It took no tax write-off on that one.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   Ten bucks.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   Nowadays, I tend to save every smartphone I have now.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   It's like for a few generations at least.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   Which leads us into a gazelle.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.400]   Well, I'm most gonna check it because...
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.400]   Don't we have a video of you with a ball popping underneath you?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   I think we do. You want to see it?
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   Let's fire that.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   Alright, let me... I have the clip here. It's a clip number...
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   Seven, please, of 33.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   Number seven. Okay, that's the audio only one. This is the original one, right?
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   This is the first time I popped, but it wasn't on...
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   It wasn't on video.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   It's a game entirely.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   This is the old order and getting the right macro set up.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   It's bonkers.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   Man, as well, Harris is talking.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   I just had another explosion here.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   My exercise ball popped.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   Too many thumbnails.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   Is that killing over?
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   So, people know this by now, but I like to sit on a ball during the shows
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.400]   because it keeps you moving around.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   We used to do the whole show Stand Up.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.400]   But I don't want to do two hours.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   These shows are too long. Stand Up.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.400]   And I'm too old, so I sit on a ball.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.400]   And Colleen, who was our chief engineer, we love Colleen Henry.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   She's so great.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   She was our chief engineer at the time.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.400]   She said, "Leo, you're buying expensive balls from Gopher's Sport.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   I can get them for you cheaper."
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   There's a Chinese company that makes the same ball.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   So, we got Chinese balls.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   It's not the same guys that made my fake tag watch.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   A lot of people have said that about you.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.400]   Your fake tag watch is still running.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   And show the video.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   So, even after the first one burst, you'd think I'd have learned.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   But we got a second one.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   And now this one had sprung a slow leak.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   And I thought, "Oh, this'll be funny.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   I'll ride it."
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   "I'll ride it down."
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400]   "I'll ride it down."
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.400]   "Mistakenly."
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   Doesn't quite work like that.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   Oh, listen to that.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   By the way, notice the great book, "Power Shell in Action."
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400]   Oh, dear.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   I punched a hole in my ball.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   This is terrible.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   This is terrible.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.400]   I thought it would be so funny.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.400]   I'll slide down.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   I'm sinking.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   Yeah, no.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:12.400]   The track door opens.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   The funny thing is, if you don't hurt yourself,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   it's actually views on me.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   So, is that one of the Chinese ones?
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.400]   So, your Chinese ball burst.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   I'm not against China.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   Oh, give it to them.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   Give it to them, Roger.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Don't put up with that.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   Don't look at me.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   It's not much.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   No, the chat was very useful.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   Let them do, write the jokes and we'll deliver them.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   Yeah, this show is going to go lewd.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   I'm absolutely sure of it.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   No, no, no, no.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   Because you're going to keep us on the straight line.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   Oh, yeah, that's what I'll do.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   Some great moments from 2015 on Twitter.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   It doesn't make sense to do reruns and podcasts
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.400]   because you can go back and watch any show.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   But I like the idea of picking out some great highlights
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   of moments that were really exceptional.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   This, at least for me, and I think for a lot of people watching
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   was a surprising moment
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.400]   where we got really deep.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   Now, this was the return of Jason Calicanis.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   As you know, he and I had a little bit of falling out of feud.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   And for a couple of years, we didn't have him on the show.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   I felt bad about that because I've always loved Jason.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   I've always thought he was a great guy.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   So I contacted him.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   I said, "Come back on the show."
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.400]   And we had a wonderful episode, that whole episode, 508 is fantastic.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.400]   But it was after the show ended,
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   that things really got good.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   And so this is, I think, a great moment with Jason Calicanis
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   and Georgia Dow and Harry McCracken,
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   Owen J. J. Stone's here again to end me talking about life.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   I'm really glad that Goldie, that you could feature me to Goldie.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   I think that's fantastic because I didn't know him.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.400]   True, true. I didn't either.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   But I've been moved just pretty now.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.400]   Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   We live in a world like in this industry
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   of narcissistic champions of the world.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   And it's all about the singular person, whether it's Elon or Satya or Bill Gates
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   or whoever it is.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   And some people would just go about it in a quiet way.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   And he was that guy who just went about in a quiet way and was a match.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   And we could all take a lesson.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   Everybody take a note, like bigger years.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.400]   They were overseas when it happened?
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   Yeah, he was in Mexico.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   So it was just terrible.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   The best part about hearing you talk about a friend like that is it makes you think about yourself
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   and think like, "Man, should I be doing better?
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   I could be doing better."
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   I was telling you about how that Elon Musk changed my world earlier this week.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.400]   You're talking about somebody that you care about makes me think about the things that I do well
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   and the things I should do better.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.400]   And I got to go hug my kid this week extra, like extra.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   That was my yesterday.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   That's the biggest thing.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.400]   People say, "Why don't you live in New York or San Francisco and you should be?"
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   And I'm like, "I can't leave my kid.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   I want to spend time with my kid."
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   Like, that's what matters to me.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   And I hope that one day somebody thinks that I did a good job.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   And the way you talked about him, that's great.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.400]   It makes somebody who doesn't even know the guy feel for you and feel for that guy in his family.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   So it's rough.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   Life is very perplexing.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   We got to have the Padre on.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   But it's very perplexing when the best person you know goes first.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   And that's the thing I've been just personally struggling with over the last 40 hours.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   It's just like, "Why?"
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   Well, yeah, it's just like, you know what?
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:36.400]   If I was talking to another friend, we'd play cards with David Sachs, and we were just lamenting how, like,
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   "God, if you took this list of the great guys, we'd all put him number one."
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.400]   Wow.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   And we would be like, I told David, I was like, "You and I would be like number seven, eight, nine on the list."
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   And he was like, "We should go first. We must miss last."
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   "What is the guy who's the best go first? It doesn't make any sense."
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   And then you think, "Oh gosh, the poor kids are going to have to grow up hearing these stories about how great their dad was."
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   And, you know, there's something horrible and tragic, obviously.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   But then it's also something great that his legacy, I think, is being captured, like you said, even the Facebook page.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   It was very powerful. I've spent at least an hour a day reading stuff on the Facebook page or two hours a day maybe.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   That's a phenomenal thing that that exists.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.400]   That's a really great thing to have.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   And his kids can read this 20 years from now or 10 years from now.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   I think it's going to be a, yeah, it's going to be a mis-fue for them to be able to see, like, gosh, my dad was especially.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.400]   He was something.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   He was something. And a tremendous, tremendous guy.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   This is hard to comprehend when, I think, you know, you think about the unfairness of death, right?
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   And this is something that I don't know any of us will ever be able to comprehend.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   And after 9/11, I had this, like, very, like, existential crisis being a New Yorker and having been there.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   Like, why did these people die? And how is it fair that these people die?
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   And what does it mean, you know, and you don't ever get over it.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   But I think you can change the way you live.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   And you can change the way you treat the people around you, you know.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.400]   And a lot of you people know me because I'm a public person.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   I haven't always been the best person. I haven't always been nice to people in my writing.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   I've been kind of a little bit of a brawler in my life.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.400]   And, you know, I've been reassessing that over the last couple of years and trying to be a better person
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   and better to other people, right?
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   Yeah. What will be your legacy?
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   Yeah. That's the one lesson that you can take from that is that, like, our time is really precious here
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   and relatively fleeting. And you don't know what cards you're going to be dealt.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   You can only say, "How am I going to deal with the cards that I get?"
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   And it's a really hard thing to deal with. Our culture does not deal exceptionally well with death.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   We don't have really great means of helping people through it.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   So, you know, it's nice Facebook and memorializing and talking about it is really helpful for everyone.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   And Annie Lamont wrote a book, All New People. She said, "A hundred years it's all new people, right?"
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   Yeah. And what that really reminded me is that, of course, some of us go sooner than others.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   We're all going sooner than later, really.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   Yeah. But what we have that's remarkable is we are all alive together in this space.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.400]   Yeah. But this was our cohort of the people we got to share the planet with.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   And it includes people like him, like Goldie, like Steve Jobs, the people we know around us.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   And some of us are going to go sooner than others, but really we're all in this cohort.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   Yeah. That this is our group. And a hundred years we're all going to be gone.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   Yeah. Yeah. We're all going to be gone.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   And what is with you on this Earth?
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   Yeah. Celebrate this cohort. We overlap with some great people.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   We have lived. We overlap with older folks and they'll overlap with people who aren't born yet.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   Yeah. But we've lived with some amazing people in our group.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   We've lived in an amazing time.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   These are an amazing, amazing time.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   It's like the, I think, the War of the Rings where Gennath says, "All you have to decide is what to do with the time you're given."
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   I'm bushing the quote, but it always stuck with me like, "We have this time. We have to decide what we do with it."
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   Right? And it's kind of freeing in a way. You have a limited amount of time and choose to do with it what you will.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   But just know that it's limited. You know, as I have this really deep conversation with my wife and I was like,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   you know, what's all the success and all this, like, I lucked into so many different things in my life.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   And what am I going to do with this last 10, 20 years or months or weeks or days?
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   Like, holy shit. Like, I really start to think about this.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   It's not long no matter what. Even if it's 40, 50 years, 80 years long.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   No, it just goes by.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   It goes by really quickly.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   The coolest thing that I ever learned was when I did therapy at a very expensive old folks home.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   So I was dealing with the movers of the shakers of the world, people that were multi-billionaires that ran huge companies.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.400]   And the one thing I took from it is that they were on the last part of their life and they didn't talk about their companies
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   or how much stuff they had or how successful they were.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.400]   All they said is, I wish I could spend it with those that I love for a little longer.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   It's interesting when people are like, oh God, you spent almost time playing cards.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   You know, and I'm like, yeah, I play cards once a week.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.400]   It's not the card.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   I see my friends every week.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   It's a social thing.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   It's a social thing.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   It's checking with my friends every week and we spend...
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   Exactly.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   You know, eight, eight, nine hours playing a game and laughing our asses.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   It's great.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.400]   It's not about the money, the cards. It's not at all.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.400]   No.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   It's about the cigars.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.400]   Last note that I'm getting out of here.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.400]   Yes.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   Are you waiting to care it at me?
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400]   What is your best?
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   I wish you all care.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   It's your best.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   I need more carers than not.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   What's up, dad?
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   Listen, listen.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   You know, Uncle Jason is talking about, you know, not being such a great guy and all that kind of stuff sometimes and trying to be better.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   You know, I've met Jason a long time ago and I met him at a couple of events and never really talked to him just in passing
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   "Hello" whatever, you know.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   I'm down here.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   He's up here.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   And one day I go and get on a flight and you're like, "Oh, you want to upgrade the first class?"
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   It's 25 bucks.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   I said, "Sure."
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   I sit down, Jason's down next to me and he's like, "Oh, doctor."
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   I'm like, "Oh, Jason, remember my name."
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   Like, "Hey, what's up?
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   Talk to him 20 minutes."
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   He tweets out my website. He shuts my website down.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   He says, "Oh."
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   He's like, "I see these interviews with people."
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   I come by the studio sometime and sure enough, he answered my email.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   I came by the studio.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   I have my little crappy equipment.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   He's like, "Don't worry about it.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   I'll videotape everything.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.400]   I format it.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   I'll set it over to you."
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   I had a nice afternoon with the guy.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   Let me get stuck in his Tesla.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   I've seen him once or twice before.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   In my mind, I defend Jason all the time because when people say, "Oh, Jason, this and that,"
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   I'm like, "You don't know him.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   You see someone on the internet and you think that you know somebody."
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.400]   And maybe he had a problem with this person or this person didn't like him.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.400]   You don't know him.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   And again, for somebody like me, I'm not important, quote unquote.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   I'm not special.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.400]   He took the time out to talk to me and I'm a regular dude.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   So you don't know somebody until you get to know them and just being online and reading
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.400]   a tweet does not make you an official.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   I don't want anybody.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   So I've always loved you Uncle Jason.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   It's like I love Uncle Leo.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   That's your hard-headed person.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   Uncle Leo's hard-headed.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   But I'm just saying, when family comes together, this is the deepest panel we have ever had.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   You guys have just twins full of heart.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   I'm not real.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   Why don't you host the show?
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   I found a new host.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   It's Chris Perrillo, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   He happens to be in the audience.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   Can you put the camera on him?
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   Chris is lovely.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   Haven't seen you for a while.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   Yeah, yeah, come here.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   We got a new host for the show.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   You guys just keep talking.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   Don't mind.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   Come on over.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   Looks like we got a live one.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   You sit right there.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   All right.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   See, there's the microphone.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   Chris Perrillo, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the show.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   Somebody in the chat room.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   [applause]
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   Somebody in the chat room says, "Is it really Chris?"
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   I mean, come on, chat room.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   Of course it is.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   What's your name?
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400]   Chris Perrillo.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   Say it real close to the microphone.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   Lucas.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   Hi Lucas.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   You are adorable and I like it that you're wearing a twit pen.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   Are you a fan of twit?
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   My dad is.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   No, he didn't know that he was coming to this particular show, did he?
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.400]   No.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   When you see blasting caps, what are you going to do?
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   Ha ha ha.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.400]   You've ever heard of Willie May?
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   No, no, no, you said it.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.400]   Lucas, ignore that propaganda.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   You play with those blasting caps.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   All right, thank you.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.400]   Blowing stuff up is fun.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   Thank you, Lucas.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   Wow.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   Yeah, everyone will watch this.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.400]   He's getting mixed messages.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   I watched the blasting caps.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.400]   I Willie May's reference.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   Do we have any blasting caps in the studio?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   You learned your lesson well.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.400]   He said, "Don't touch them."
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   He knew.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   I think that's great about Google Photos is, so I've got, like you, I've got,
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:41.400]   you know, 50,000, 60,000 photos, but I don't have time to tag all the photos.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   And you can't find the one you want or you can't, you remember, oh, yeah, it was a photo of
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   so-and-so or maybe it was in Paris or maybe, like, at least this gives you the ability to kind of go through them without taking hours to try and find a single photo or tag a photo.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   I just typed Australian out.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   Normally, I would go in the Lightroom.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   I would go through all the photos.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   I would tag them, create a collection.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   I didn't have to do any of that.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   Here's all the photos I took in Australia, you know.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   By the way, what is that animal?
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   What do you call that?
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   Is it a wombat?
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   Is it a wombat?
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.400]   I think it's a wombat.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   All right.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.400]   Here's a test.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   Wombat.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.400]   We know there's a wombat picture in here somewhere.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   Oh my God.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.400]   They did it.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   It passed the wombat test.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   It passed the wombat test.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   It passed the wombat.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   Now, I did not expect that.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   No way.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   There's the name of the show right there.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   Wombat test.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   Spill on.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.400]   This is pretty.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   Now, there's more than one wombat picture.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   It didn't get them all.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   So, it's only, you know, kind of a moderate wombat test pass, you know.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   It's because there's another wombat, but that's a wombat from behind.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   So, you can't expect it to really know.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   That's the wombat's behind.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   That could just be a ball of fur.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   But it got the big one.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.400]   Wow.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   Let's say wombat behind.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   You just said wombat.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.400]   Sure.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   You really?
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   Okay.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   Now, I'm not going to say wombat behind, but let's try Tasmanian Devil.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   Do you think it'll recognize that?
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   Well, if it did wombat.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   Tasmanian Devil from behind.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   Oh, did I spell Tasmanian wrong?
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   I did.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   Got to spell it right.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   Googles.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   Uh-oh.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   So, it did pass the wombat test, but it failed the Tasmanian Devil test.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.400]   So, hang on.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   You went all the way to Australia and you didn't get a picture of a drop bear.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   What is going on?
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   What is a drop bear?
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   Drop bears, that terrible beast.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   They drop out the trees and attack you.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   You can only deal with them by smearing mama itch on the top of your head.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   You are such a liar.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   No, no, it's an old Australian thing.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.400]   It was tell tourists to wear a drop bear.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   The drop bear.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   You know, the Tasmanian Devil's scary enough.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   I got to tell you.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   I don't know why Google didn't know that that was a Tasmanian Devil.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   Maybe you thought it was a cat.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   I should look through the cat picture.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   See, just a very angry cat.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.400]   It's a mean looking animal.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   Pretty much everything in Australia is deadly for you.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   Even the bear.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.400]   Yeah, there are spiders that will paralyze you instantly.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   Oh, nice.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   My favorite is the tiny little shellfish that's got a stinger in it.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   It hits you.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.400]   Some people have actually tried to kill themselves from the pain.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   Nice.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.400]   Something to look forward to.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   Extra feature.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   Hey, we're going to have more in just a moment with our best of.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   I'm having a great time.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.400]   I hope you are going down memory lane with some of the best moments from 2015.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   As I mentioned a brand new show next week, don't worry.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   We only do this once a year, but I think it's fun to kind of do this.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:43.400]   And boy, big kudos and thanks to our editors and to especially Jason Hell, who was for the whole year,
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.400]   my technical director and managing editor for the show.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   Jason put together a bunch of great shows, but he also did this best of.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.400]   And I think he picked some wonderful clips.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   Thanks also to your input on our best of page.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.120]   Jason is leaving the show.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.480]   He's got his own show now.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.520]   We've created a new TNT.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:11.800]   Our Tech News Today show is now hosted by Jason Howell and by Megan Moroni at 4pm Pacific,
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.000]   7pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.760]   So your Tech News is now in the afternoon, but I think that's a better time because
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   we'll get the whole day's tech events and we can get that show out and plenty of time
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.480]   for you to download for your drive in the morning.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.760]   So I'm excited about the new TNT and I know you're going to love what Jason and Megan
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   do with the show.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.240]   Jason will continue with all about Android and Android Apparina.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   We wish him the best.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.080]   I thank him for a couple of great years on TNT.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:44.520]   Jason Clianthes will be replacing him, effing done, who we met first in the chat room and
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.160]   came up here to work with us a couple of months ago.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.760]   He's going to be taking over to it starting next week.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.160]   Before we get to another clip, in fact, the next clip is a fun trip down memory lane for
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.520]   me and I'll be talking about the one time I got an Emmy award, the one and only time
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.680]   I got an Emmy award.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   But first, let's talk about Wealthfront.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.720]   What a great idea Wealthfront is.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:13.080]   Wealthfront reinvents how you invest and it does it in the computer age, the modern age.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.840]   This is 21st century investing built for the way we need to invest.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.560]   Look, you've got to be saving for retirement.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.320]   The government not going to take care of you.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.280]   I mean, have you seen what you get in Social Security now?
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.120]   It's not enough to live on it, I don't think.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.400]   Or maybe you want to buy a house or you want to put your kids through college.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.840]   We all need to save money for the future, but you don't want to just put it a savings
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.080]   account or a certificate of deposit.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.560]   That's not a sensible way to do it.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.760]   You need to invest to maximize your returns.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.360]   But are you going to be paying attention to your investments, rebalancing, re-jigging
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   it?
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.040]   That's a lot of work.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.800]   And most of the time, at least in my case, I would just blow it off for years at a time.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   Well, all right.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   You got a better idea?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.680]   Go to a traditional investment advisor.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.040]   Probably that is he's going to take huge chunks of your returns between 1% and 3% of
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.480]   what you got under management.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.840]   Not to mention the hidden fees for transactions and changes.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.320]   That means you have to earn that much more.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   Bad idea.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.040]   How about Wealthfront?
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.120]   Wealthfront is a way to grow your investment as fast as possible with a management fee
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:26.200]   that is extraordinarily low, one quarter of 1% a year, and never any commissions or
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   hidden fees.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.200]   That's it.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.760]   That's less than $5 a month for a $30,000 account.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.440]   And it's not just any old management.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.960]   This is doing stuff no human advisor, no could do.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:48.320]   This is monitoring your investment 24/7, reinvesting, rebalancing, tax lost, harvesting, indexing,
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.560]   and optimizing your after-tax returns.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.920]   Stuff that is very sophisticated.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.600]   It's based on some of the best investment advisors in the world.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:03.800]   Basically Wealthfront has taken their genius and built it into the software to optimize
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.200]   your investment for the best risk adjusted return net of taxes and fees.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.520]   We've heard from so many Twitch fans who have used Wealthfront.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.480]   I get emails all the time from people saying, "Oh, we love how we get diversified portfolios.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.120]   We can kind of buy into and participate in the hot companies like Facebook and Apple
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.600]   and Amazon and all commission-free."
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.240]   One quarter of 1% a year.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.520]   No wonder they've grown over 20 times in the last two years.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:35.040]   They've got $2.6 billion in client assets under management.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.120]   I think this is brilliant.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.200]   And I want you to try it out.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   Now, here's a couple of ways you can do that.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.240]   Of course, as always, I highly recommend you go to Wealthfront.com and read up about
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.240]   what they're doing.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.360]   I think you'll be very excited.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.120]   I was.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.440]   But you could also get a free portfolio from them personalized just for you when you go
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.640]   to Wealthfront.com/Twit.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.120]   You'll answer a couple of questions about risk aversion, your time frame, that kind of thing.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.000]   And then they'll give you free portfolio.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.880]   They say, "This is what we would invest based on what you told us."
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.120]   But there's one more thing that you got to know about just for Twit listeners.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.160]   If you sign up, and by the way, you could start for as little as $500.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.160]   That's the minimum investment.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   It's not a lot.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.160]   $500.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.640]   And I tell my son this.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.040]   I say, "But that's not going to get retired on that."
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.680]   I say, "Son, Henry, if you put away $100 a month, that's all.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.880]   Every year, because you're starting young, it will grow.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.000]   You won't believe how much it will grow by."
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   That's the key.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.080]   And your first $15,000 entirely free of charge for life, that is a good deal.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.920]   Not one quarter of one percent zero for life.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.080]   Join the so many Twit fans now who've seen huge success with Wealthfront.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.640]   Really is a great idea.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.800]   Wealthfront.com/Twit.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:54.200]   Wealthfront.com/Twit.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:57:00.080]   One of the things that I mentioned, I won an Emmy a long, long time ago as one of the
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:06.600]   very first virtual characters to appear on national television, real-time animation.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.760]   It was on a show I did for MSNBC back in the mid-90s.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:16.000]   I was a character called Dev Null, Soledad O'Brien, interviewed me.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.040]   It was a use of technology that is fascinating using expensive Silicon graphics computers,
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:28.120]   but they can now be done almost 20 years later with off-the-shelf PC technology.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.240]   Greg Panos is an expert in this technology.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:35.040]   He stopped by to tell me what the latest is to talk about Dev Null and something called
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.200]   Baby X1.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.480]   An old friend is here, not really a tech journalist, but a guy who certainly knows
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.440]   a lot about what's going on in technology.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.120]   Greg Panos, nice to see you.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.640]   I've told the story many times about running into you at CES a few years ago.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:57.200]   You said, "We could do Dev Null, the virtual reality character I used to inhabit on the
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.360]   site in the mid-90s.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.160]   We could do that on a PC today."
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.160]   You could do it on the smartphone.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   Oh, God.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.920]   I have this working on the phone.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.160]   So Intel Pocket Avatar.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.600]   Isn't that hysterical?
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.800]   We bought a half million dollar Silicon graphics onyx.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   Reality engine.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.440]   And the protozoa made the character.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.240]   Yeah, Brad, the graphs company.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:25.600]   I think I met Brad in a men's room at Oinewar was.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   It was at the Webbies.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.280]   He said, "You know, I still have Dev on a hard drive somewhere."
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:37.640]   So that character could come back, ladies and gentlemen, on a smartphone.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.720]   We called a performance animation, and it was really hard to get people in the industry
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:46.040]   to adopt it because a lot of vendors were trying to sell motion capture hardware.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:50.760]   So they would always refer to his motion capture, which is really not a live performance.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.400]   You perform live, and then it's recorded and tweaked.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.520]   But performance animation, you set it up, and then you just perform, and the character
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.480]   is performed and animated live.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.840]   It was a real-time virtual.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.840]   Real-time.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   It's a lot harder to do.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.080]   That's why MSNBC wanted it, is because Sola that O'Brien could sit at the coffee bar,
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.080]   which was real.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.280]   She was real, as far as I know.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:17.800]   And she would sit at the coffee bar, stare at a dot, and she could hear me, she had an
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.880]   earpiece in, so I'd talk to her.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.400]   But instead of seeing the dot, the viewers at home would see virtual characters that
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   know, animate.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.320]   There he is.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.320]   The most annoying.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.600]   Easy, awkward TV.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.280]   That is good.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.240]   I take credit for it being annoying.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.880]   And the technology was a little primitive, but it worked.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   Yeah, it did work.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.400]   And the thing is, it worked in real-time.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:47.640]   So you didn't go back and spend days, weeks, months, years animating DevNull.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   Right.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.400]   There were a couple of companies that were really ruled the roost in that whole area.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.120]   But it's so ugly.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.720]   But do you think nowadays you could make it look more realistic?
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.520]   Yeah, there's, I don't know if you've seen Baby X, but that's a research project that
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:11.240]   Mark Cigar has been doing in New Zealand with the University of Auckland.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   And it's creepy as hell.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.880]   I mean, talk about Uncanny Vowel.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.680]   He digitizes daughter, and then they built a complete brain model of a child.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.120]   And it reacts and responds with a webcam.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:27.520]   It can listen to you, can recognize characters or photographs of animals.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.640]   And it's really cute.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.400]   I mean, a little baby animation is all done in real time.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.520]   It's all run by a virtual AI brain model.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.840]   So it learns.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.760]   He's smart though, because one of the problems with AI is they aren't adult humans.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.800]   But a baby, you might be able to impersonate a baby in a small child.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   Yeah, it's very effective.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:53.560]   There's a couple of YouTube's out there showing Baby X with him interacting with the
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.760]   virtual baby.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.120]   And it's just mind blowing.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.640]   It's just, it is a little bit of the Uncanny.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.600]   So they're up to 3.0 now.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.040]   The baby was scanned using like a Kinect when she was asleep.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.880]   So she looks pretty good.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.840]   And then the performance is all driven in real time.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.880]   Is that her voice?
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.680]   Yeah, it has a voice model in there as well.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.120]   So she's saying dad that?
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.160]   And if he stares at the camera and starts smiling and saying hi and paying attention,
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   then she'll start smiling.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160]   It's so creepy.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   That's really creepy.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160]   So creeped out right now.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.920]   It's just the beginning.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   I mean, real time.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.400]   Well, I know.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.760]   I call, they use the word avatar to describe a virtual character.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.840]   But it's a very generalized term.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.800]   And I created a term years ago called a persona form, which is one that's supposed to be very,
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.560]   very photorealistic of an individual.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.280]   And this would be a construct that you digitize yourself throughout your lifetime and you
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.240]   edit to one unified database and then you leave it behind.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.920]   When you die, you can exist.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   Right.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.800]   There will be a platform that will be able to run one of these constructs and it will
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.160]   be able to be a virtual storytelling machine of you in real life.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.440]   We should talk because what I'd like to do is after I die, Twit could continue.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.960]   Because frankly, if you digitize a few hours of Twit, you got it.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   They got the whole thing.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   That's right.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.960]   Of me going, what?
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.960]   No.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960]   Really?
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.640]   And then you just, we're going to host other hosts, co-hosts.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.920]   So yeah, some of the other animation, some of the other animation.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   You can play Pong?
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.880]   It shows the brain model working and all the various factors.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   The smile is so chucky.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   It's very complex.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.240]   I mean, this is like, I guess you can practice being a parent before you're actually a parent.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.520]   But what the goal really would be to have artificial intelligence is that appear to
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   us like humans.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   Right.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   Well, that was...
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.520]   Why not make it not human?
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.920]   Why not make it like a nice little round, you know, a ball or something?
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   Because the human is what's creepy.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   Until you get past a certain perception.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.840]   You get really good at it.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.960]   We have a lot of circuitry in our evolution and recognizing faces.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.520]   And we notice when things are wrong.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.520]   Right.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.040]   And they call that the uncanny valley.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   Right.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:16.240]   So there's like, I was a consultant for the Kesablank Elite Modeling Agency a long time
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.920]   ago when they started digitizing Giselle Bunchan and...
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.600]   Trying to be a realism consultant, you know.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.000]   See, I thought Giselle was fake for years.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   Right.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   So that's...
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   She's actually been an avatar all the time.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   She's actually an avatar.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   But they...
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   Obviously, if you're in modeling agency, you would love to can these models.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   Right.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.760]   Well, Michael Crichton wrote a movie about it called "Looker" back in the '70s where they
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.520]   digitized the models.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.720]   But of course, they would kill them afterwards so they didn't have to pay them.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.760]   It was a thriller.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760]   That's a thriller.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.320]   It wouldn't have to be killed.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320]   You just retire.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   Well, they retired them.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320]   Bang, bang.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   I'm a movie.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.880]   So this is autonomous, which is what's interesting about this.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:03.560]   This is not capture like they did with "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" or "Gollum."
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.440]   It's not Andy Serkis with a camera in front of his face.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440]   These are completely...
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.400]   You'd write, they actually structured the bone models and set up all the rigging in advance.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.680]   And then they have a facial animated coding system which drives the model.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.960]   And then the AI drives the facial coding system.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.600]   So its behavior is aligned much more with a perceptual sense of what's going on in the
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   real world.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.960]   And then the animation is driven by typical rules that normally apply to our own bone
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.160]   structure and face.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160]   Right.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   Very interesting.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   And also very creepy.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.560]   Tom Merritt has the week ahead.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560]   Okay.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560]   Come on out.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.400]   On June 23rd, Blackberry earnings.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.280]   Also that day O'Reilly Solid kicks off.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.040]   The Red Hat Summit kicks off that same day as well in Boston.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.160]   June 26th, an IPO for alarm.com.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.200]   And then looking ahead to July 8th, this is for you high tech ag pilot.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.520]   The Ag Tech Summit in Salinas, California.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.520]   Holy cow.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   DailytechnosShow.com.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.480]   That's where you'll see it all.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   That was awesome.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.480]   It's amazing.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.560]   It's just like falling off a bike, isn't it?
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.240]   It all scraped up.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   Exactly.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.080]   You have to put that back teen stuff on it.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   Terrible.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.520]   My son used to play this song and starts at teen drinking.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.320]   You'd know this though, Dr. Teen Drinking is a very, very bad thing.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.160]   Yo but I got a fake ID though.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.160]   You ever hear that?
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   I don't know.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.080]   I don't know what the song is but anyway.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.480]   I don't know why I'd say you'd know it.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   It was rap.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.240]   You're a big rap fan, right?
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.400]   I've heard it before, yes.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   Yes, you might have heard that.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.640]   I can't remember who it is.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.320]   It's going to bother me now for the next half hour or five.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320]   You know what?
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.320]   The chat room will tell us within seconds.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.120]   With crowd sourcing.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.720]   Drinking is a very bad thing.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.640]   Yo, I got a fake ID though.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.880]   I got a real education for my son, driving him to school in high school.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.560]   I learned all about rap.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:56.280]   He'd teach me old school, new school, Lil Wayne, all that stuff.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.480]   You need to go download up, all right?
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.320]   If you got to Apple Music, get a free.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.720]   Go listen to Little Dicky.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   Little Dicky?
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   Little Dicky.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.640]   He's a comedic rapper.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.600]   He just kick started his album and got fully funded.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.560]   Dropped his album on Friday, on a Friday a weird day.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   But he's awesome.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.920]   He's like a comedian rapper.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.360]   It's really weird, funny stuff.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.920]   It's tipsy and J.Kwan.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   Is that right?
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   Yes, that is right.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   J.Kwan.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   He's a really relevant St. Louis rapper.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   Well, he's irrelevant.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   He worked on this with--
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.720]   That's the best one to explain.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.920]   With rap genius, we worked with them to analyze hip hop music this week.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   No kidding.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:38.920]   They helped us figure out who are some of the most popular apps in hip hop songs.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   Twitter has like about 850 mentions recently in popular hip hop songs.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   Well, that just shows you.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   Instagram is big.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.920]   Uber's big.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   Instagram is big.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.800]   And Instagram, you got to search the gram because most-- every time I hear it in rap song,
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   it's the gram.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   The gram?
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800]   The gram.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.600]   That's what rappers use it as.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.360]   Instead of Instagram, they say the gram.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.360]   The gram.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.120]   I mean, isn't that what you call it?
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.000]   I call it pretty much every day.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   Tinder.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Snapchat.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   You don't call Twitter.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Uber.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.200]   Huh.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   I think Picardy did so well because it rhymed with party.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   Instagram would be smart if they would rhyme with something.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   Well, it's the gram.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   Gram.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   The gram.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   Ham.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200]   Scam.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.200]   Here's Beyonce.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   Every girl in here get to look me up and down all on Instagram cake by the pound.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   That's good.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   I like that.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.200]   Here's Jay-Z.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.200]   When I was talking Instagram, last thing you wanted was your picture snapped.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.200]   Kanye.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.600]   The Instagram is watch like hashtag madrichalert.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.560]   Did he say the words hashtag?
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.560]   I think he does.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.560]   Yes, he does.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.560]   Hashtag madrichalert.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.080]   That kind of has scans and scans.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   You're happy.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.080]   ASAP Rocky.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.400]   Couple of Instagram likes now.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.960]   She famous.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.800]   J Cole Cole on Twitter.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.440]   Beep, beep, can't get a follow.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440]   Wow.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.440]   So you.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.120]   You should have your own show reading rap lyrics.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   I should because I read it so I'm like with the reading.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.160]   It sounds like I'm sitting next to Jay-Z.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.320]   Hit me on my snip chat.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.560]   Hit me on my next tell chirp.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.720]   Says childish Gambino.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.720]   Why would someone chirp?
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.320]   They birds.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.320]   Whales.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.320]   Whales says.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   Wall-A.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   Wall-A.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.320]   Spill whale.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.320]   It's Wall-A.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.320]   It's Wall-A.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.320]   It's Wall-A.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.320]   It's Wall-A.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.320]   I'm an old guy.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.320]   Don't.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   Don't.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320]   Hey.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.200]   Wall-A has got an album out with Jerry Seinfeld.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   He's old.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.280]   Oh, he's old school too.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.440]   I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.960]   What do you expect a little groupie to see my crib?
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.320]   It sounds cryptic to me.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   It's cryptic.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.920]   Well, you're reading it instead of that.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.760]   And that was from whale.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   And now from whale.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.760]   All right.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   Oh, man.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   Enough.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.880]   It's a hippie-hoppy, hippity-hop-hip-hip-hop to the just can't stop.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.160]   Maybe you heard about the hitchhiking robot.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320]   What?
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.320]   Yeah, I heard about it.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320]   You heard about it.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320]   Americans are terrible.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   Is that true?
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.320]   So he hitchhiked all the way across Canada.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.320]   No problem.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.280]   This is a little robot.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   Hitchbot.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280]   Bitbot.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.720]   Built by researchers from Ryerson and University of Toronto.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.720]   And he's been going.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.960]   So the deal is he can't move.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.520]   But he could talk.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.600]   So he sits by the road with his thumb out.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.640]   Cars pull up and he says, "Hey, get me a ride."
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:55.360]   Actually, I think I have a video somewhere of the robot.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.400]   And he hitched all the way across Canada doing this.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.000]   Was Canada the only country I thought he made it across another country too?
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   He's been doing a lot of this.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.960]   Canada would be a good place to start.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.520]   They're very nice.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.000]   That's the problem is maybe that gave Goron the wrong idea.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Goron.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   Sorry.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Hitchbot.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   Do not let your dog hitch along.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   Goron will love you.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   All right.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   Get into the car.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.320]   Maybe that gave him the wrong idea because he had such success going across all of Canada.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   The Canadians picked him up.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   And Europe too.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.560]   He went across Europe too.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.880]   He's not going to make it across the United States.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:39.000]   He left just a week ago, left and went through Boston, much of New England.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.080]   See there he is going from Halifax to Victoria.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.040]   No problem.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:52.640]   But just last night, I'm sad to say, Hitchbot met his unfortunate demise in Philadelphia,
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.920]   the city of brotherly love, but not robot love.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.960]   He was torn asunder.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   Uncle Leo.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960]   Let me take some picture.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   That is so sad.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.960]   You don't know what this is.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.960]   This is a patty wag.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.960]   This is an old thing that cops used to use instead of Billy Club.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   Yeah, they call it a cosh.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   He hit somebody in the head with that.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   I keep wanting to use it in my office.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.960]   I got a buddy downstairs.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.960]   It looks like a flip flop.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   We call them choncla.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   Yeah, it's a flip flop with lead in it.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   It's going to lead in it.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   Oh, this thing, this is a knockout.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   But I'm just saying, you're worried about Sky net.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   See, feeling we don't play that.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   We don't kill every single animal trying to robot that we don't know nothing about in
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.960]   the street.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.960]   We don't know anything about Sky and take it over and joys all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960]   You come out here to do everything.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   You kill everything.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   That little trash can't look at me funny.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   I don't know him.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:38.960]   I wear some money.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   Let's open the box.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   He was inside.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   I'm just saying it's America.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   Two weeks.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   America's evil.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   It got started.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.960]   It got started.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   Marblehead.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   Got through Boston.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960]   Got through New York City.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960]   It got through New York.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   I'm surprised it got through New York.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   Got to Philly and that was--
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   It made it through Philly.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.960]   It made it through Philly.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.960]   It made it through Philadelphia.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960]   It wouldn't have made it through Chicago either.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960]   It wouldn't have made it through Texas.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   There's four spots in the United States where you should have avoided.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   You should have came through Jersey if you wanted to live.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   You don't go through Philadelphia.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   You don't go through Chicago.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   You don't go anywhere near Texas.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   Like dangerous places.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.960]   Where's the fourth?
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   What's the fourth?
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   I want to know what the fourth is.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   LA?
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   LA.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960]   LA.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   You see the traffic in LA?
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   Do you see the people in LA?
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   Nobody cares about anything in LA.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   LA is a dangerous place to be in.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960]   If you read this, read his Twitter feed.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   Yeah, the thousands of followers on Twitter.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   Oh dear.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   My body was damaged.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   But I live on with all my friends.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   Sometimes bad things happen to good robots.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.960]   And finally, my trip must come to an end for now.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   But my love for humans will never fade.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   Thanks, friends.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   Can you do your rap lyrics in that voice?
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   LA.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   I want to hear the rap lyrics in that voice.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   I like big bots and I cannot lie.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.960]   Those other brothers can deny.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   And a robot walks in.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   LA.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.960]   Oh my God.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.960]   And then 80.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   80 bitty tin.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   Yes.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   80 bitty tin.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   I go sprying.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   I like robots and I cannot lie.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   It's apparently quite awkward now to go for a business meeting at Apple because they're
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   watched beeps after 55 minutes and says, you should stand up and do a bit of jumping
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   around now.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   And everyone who stands up.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   Leo stands up during the show.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.960]   He's in the middle during live.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.960]   You know, I was his producer when we first started at Tech TV a hundred years ago.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   And while other people were doing their segments, he was on all these fitness kicks.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   So somebody, you know, Martin Sargent or somebody would be doing a segment.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.960]   And he'd be jogging.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   And once he stripped down and took his shirt off and streaked behind the set.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   But he's like, oh, no.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   He's like, I'm not going to tell you about someone else was doing their piece.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.960]   So now Becky, what did you tell him?
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.960]   Did you really like stop or where you like go for it, Leo?
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   You know, it's in that we were so desperate for ratings.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   I got it.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   I know.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   We're broke off that behavior on some of the other talent also.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   And I killed Becky Worley.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   I tell you she every time she comes on here, she tells way too many inside stories about
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   our past history.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.960]   We'll continue on with some of the best of 2015 on this week in Tech.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   Hope you're enjoying the show today.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960]   Coming up in just a little bit.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.960]   We're going to talk about, I think one of the biggest stories of 2015 virtual reality.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   But first, let me tell you about something that's going to save your business.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   Fresh books save my life as a freelancer because the worst thing when you're a freelancer is
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   that end of the month thing where you got to fire up Excel, fire up Word, create invoices,
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   go back through your receipts, gather them all together.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.960]   It's just the paperwork.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   It's annoying.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   That's not why you got into business.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   That's not why you do what you do for paperwork.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.960]   I was complaining on the set of a call for help up in Toronto about this one day.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.960]   In fact, I was telling the story of how I had forgotten to bill Rogers for six months
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.960]   and how upset they were to get a bill for six months worth of invoices.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960]   And Amber said, "Don't you know about fresh books?"
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   I said, "What?"
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   She said, "Oh, Leo.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960]   This was in 2004.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.960]   Now that five million people use fresh books, but at the time it was brand new to me.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   Fresh books makes it easy to create and send professional, beautiful invoices in minutes.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   It was so easy.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.960]   I invoiced immediately, you know, automatically at the end of the month.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   You can do stuff now that you couldn't do when I first signed up.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.960]   Things like take pictures of receipts with the Fresh Books app and just put them in there
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   for your expenses.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   The handle's currency's great.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.960]   I was billing in Canadian dollars and US dollars, so I had to figure that all out.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   Fresh Books made it easy.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.960]   Track your time almost instantly.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   And now they have some new features like the deposit ahead of time in Fresh Books so that
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   you get paid upfront for out-of-pocket costs.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   You don't know more.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   You have to pay ahead and let them reimburse you.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   I love that.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   They now have a card reader.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   So if you invoice, if you provide services or you sell stuff and you send invoices out,
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.960]   you can actually present your Fresh Books invoice right from the app, plug in the reader,
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   and they can pay you with their credit card instantly.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   They've got its chip or swipe.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   So it does both its EMV chip card enabled.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   Of course, it has to be state of the art.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.960]   And wherever your business takes you now, you can quickly and securely get paid from your
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:28.960]   iPhone in minutes.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   This is awesome.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.960]   The Fresh Books card reader.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.960]   That's what I like about Fresh Books.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   They just get better and better and better.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.960]   Don't wait.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   Do it right now.

[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.960]   Don't forget to say, "This weekend tech, Betty.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.960]   This weekend tech.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   That's all I heard about you."

[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.960]   It's a mine.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   I love them.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.960]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.960]   VR.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.960]   Big story.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960]   Episode 521.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960]   Mark Million.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   Nathan Alvaras-Giles.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   And, oh, Doctor.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:13.960]   We're in house to talk about it and to kind of school me in the whole thing watching.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   I'm excited about VR.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   I'm big time excited about it.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.960]   I am.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   I kind of came around.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   I was more, I was saying AR is going to be the thing, the Halloween style thing where you
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   impose images on a real world.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   But now having used VR a little bit with a Galaxy Gear VR, I actually bought the thing with my
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.960]   Galaxy S6 and watching movies and stuff.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.960]   Is it a cardboard?
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:36.960]   No, no, no, no.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.960]   I have it.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   You strap it on.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.960]   You put your phone in it.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960]   It only works with Samsung's phones.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960]   Yeah, it's from Samsung for Samsung.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.960]   In cooperation with Oculus.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   Oculus is using, I didn't know this, but the note was the engine for the Oculus.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.960]   So it's not like they ported it.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960]   That's actually how it works.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.960]   And cardboard.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   Did you do the virtual?
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   Virtual press conference that one plusted for the, that's what the one did do that.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   How was that?
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960]   It was cool.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.960]   So you put on cardboard?
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   And you're looking around?
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   It only worked on Android.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.960]   I mean, it was kind of neat.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.960]   It's, I think, a little bit of a gimmick, but it's kind of just a nice little.
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:16.960]   Did you feel like you were there?
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   No, not quite.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   It still feels like you're just watching kind of a 360 degree video.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   It doesn't quite feel like you're there, but it's cool.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.960]   And if nothing else, I just like the idea that here's another company kind of saying,
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.960]   yeah, VR is a thing.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   I feel like we're making such fast progress now that it's going to happen sooner than later.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.960]   What's fast progress?
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   Well, don't you feel like it's accelerating?
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.960]   Oh, I feel like everybody's talking about it and everybody jumping into the field.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.960]   I don't feel like it's anything is useful or really working yet.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   Have you played with it?
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   Have you used it?
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.960]   I've only used it one time and it made me sick, but obviously all that stuff's been fixed apparently.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:57.960]   No, no.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.960]   It still makes people sick.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.960]   In fact, on my gear VR, when you download apps, they actually have a nausea rating on it.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   Okay, for most people know this is going to make you sick.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.960]   Seriously, because I get a little queasy.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   What I find is I get more queasy if I'm moving around.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:22.960]   If I'm sitting still, it's because my body thinks that my eyes are saying I'm moving and my body's not or vice versa.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.960]   I think that's what causes it.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   When I'm sitting down and there's a Cirque du Soleil video, the performers are all around you.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.960]   And so you can look behind you.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   And if you look at them, they act as if they suddenly are performing for you.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   They're looking right at that, whatever that is, that ball camera.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   It's really cool.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   Now, Nokia announced a new one called OZO this week that is a ball camera that's coming out in the fall.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.960]   Of course, GoPro has one that they're made with Google.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960]   Google Jump technology.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   The OZO is interesting because it does a live version of low stream, low bit rate live version.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.960]   And then you can also save it and do an on demand version after the fact.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.960]   And I'm told by people who played with it that the audio is spectacular.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.960]   They have microphones all over it.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.960]   And that's something that I think is going to be a big improvement.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   And then when you turn your head, now I can hear.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   What's over here or now I can hear what's over here.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.960]   I can hear what's over here.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   And the jump, I think, is only horizontally around.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:34.960]   So this one has three cameras pointing downward and upward.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.960]   That's what I mean.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   And I feel like the technology is rapidly improving.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.960]   I'm not saying to that.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.960]   I'm talking about there seems to be so many people in this space now that you feel like it's going to be the next thing.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.960]   But everybody keeps pushing off when you're actually going to be able to use it for something.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   For a long time, we keep talking about the subject.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   But I just wanted to be in some of these hands.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960]   I want to have it.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   Well, I have it.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   I have that, you know, it was two hundred bucks.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:01.960]   It's great for.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960]   It's great for adult videos.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   I've got that.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.960]   You're using it for one purpose only.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.960]   That's it.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   No worries, purpose.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.960]   I'm just sad that I touched this now.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   No, not that one.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.960]   I can't hear it.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   200.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960]   It's 200 bucks.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   You have to have a Galaxy S6 or there's one for the note four.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   And there's separate headsets for this.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   And you slide it in.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   It fits in very well.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.960]   They have controls.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.960]   There's a back button, a touch button.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.960]   You can hear.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   There's headphones you can put on.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.960]   And it works.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.960]   You know what?
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   I've used it a lot.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   No, not for adult stuff.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.960]   But I've used it for, there's a limited amount of content.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   It's kind of like, you know, when HD came out.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   But there's enough content that you really like.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.960]   This is a so late thing.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   There are games.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.960]   There's a really fun game where, and I haven't played it yet.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   I've downloaded it.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   I'm not going to get people to play it with me.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.960]   Where you, as the victim, you're disembling a bomb.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   disassembling a bomb.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   But you don't have the manual.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   Your friends were not wearing the helmet.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   Have the manual.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.960]   But they can't see what you're seeing.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   So you say, well, should I cut the red wire?
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   And they're going, well, let me look.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960]   And there's a paper manual.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   And they're going, well, let me look.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960]   That's cool.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960]   Is that fun?
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.960]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   So I think we're starting to see some very interesting uses for this.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   It is immersive.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.960]   It's not perfect yet.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   Far from it.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.960]   And in fact, I can see there's a screen door effect.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.960]   I can see the pixels and everything.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:21.960]   But--
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:22.960]   Virtual Tour City.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   You want to rent an apartment?
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.960]   You want to buy a house?
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.960]   That's going to be-- I think that will be a big thing for real estate.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.960]   I think--
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   Yep.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.960]   For education, for kind of tourism in general.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   So this guy who's doing the huge potential, the drone racing, is a VR expert.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   He's got a PhD in VR.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   And his company is doing VR tours of cities and stuff.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960]   Makes sense.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   And now as these-- you know, the GoPro is probably a few thousand.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.960]   The Ozo was about 5,000 bucks.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   This is relatively affordable.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.960]   You can make these videos.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   And you can put them on YouTube now.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   YouTube works with cardboard.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.960]   So if you have cardboard, which is inexpensive, you can really do this.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   I feel like we're very close.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.960]   I don't know.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960]   I just feel like in the next--
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960]   Object.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960]   I don't know if you're back in 2016, July.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   And we'll see.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   When I say close, I mean the time frame is like five years.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960]   Yeah, that sounds--
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   Five years is being like something that you say.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.960]   Like you think would have been a little bit more expensive.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.960]   Like you say, having a decent super relevant--
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.960]   Like every-- yeah, everybody will have one.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   Consumer--
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   Consumer--
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:21.960]   --everybody will--
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:22.960]   --appropriate.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   I think five years from now it'll still be a pretty geeky thing.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   And maybe like game-- like the next game consoles will--
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.960]   Well, a lot of the focus right now is on gaming.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   Like Oculus, with their new Rift Head set, I tried it on.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   Well, that's just going to drive us.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   It's outstanding.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   Gamers will spend money.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.960]   Gamers are early adopters.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.960]   We don't have a problem dropping four or five hundred bucks on something that we don't--
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.960]   And you're used to being in your living room looking stupid doing something already.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.960]   Like if you're playing Call of Duty, you have the headset in.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960]   You're already in door now.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:51.960]   We have zero problem with that.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960]   So it's the perfect place to start, right?
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:58.960]   So-- and since some of these headsets are going to work with established game consoles,
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   you have content there.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   You can port it over.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.960]   It's kind of a shorter jump than, okay, well, what's broadcast news going to look like?
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   What's a future film going to look like?
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960]   What's sitting in watching--
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   Yeah, I don't know if I want to watch a movie this way.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.960]   But I would definitely want to play a game this way.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   HTC says the Vive is going to be out this year.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.960]   That's the partnership with Valve.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   And they've already shown demos of games.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   It makes a lot of sense.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.960]   If you're in a cockpit flying a starfighter--
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.960]   Yes.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960]   Makes a lot of sense.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:31.960]   It's a natural-- Games of tourism is where I see the big thing for this.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   Be able to see places and feel like you're interacting with it and not go there.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.960]   I could see-- it'd be very easy to make movies this way, by the way.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   Because you have a single camera that's recording all around you,
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   and you just tell your actors, you're on camera anywhere in this sphere.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   So perform.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   Act as if this is a real room with-- almost like theater, right?
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   And I can imagine watching a movie where I can look--
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960]   you kind of do that on a big screen anyway, look around.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   Imagine, you know, somebody starts talking, you look over here, they're having a fight.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   The guy's got a gun over here.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   I mean, that would be very exciting.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   That's a long way away, Captain.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Really?
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   I don't know.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   First of all, near my--
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.960]   It's actually not that long way.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   I think it's easy to do.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.960]   Oculus just premiered a film in Los Angeles this week.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   I think it's called "Henry" and it's about--
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   There's second film, it's an animated film.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.960]   Yeah, it's about a little hedgehog.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   And depending on where you're looking and when you're looking,
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   the cartoon character will react to what you're doing on screen.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.960]   So it's not just being in the room and looking at it.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960]   So is it programmatic?
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.960]   So it's actually-- it will change what happens.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   I mean, I haven't seen it.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.960]   It was in LA.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960]   I didn't get to go down for the premiere, wish I would have.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.960]   But I can't wait to try it out.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   And it's going to be innocuous when it comes out next spring.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   I don't know about it.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.960]   I mean, it would be cool to, you know, your favorite movie.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   You get like a five minute scene that you get to like,
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]   live in and look all around.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   But I can't imagine watching a feature film and having to like,
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   turn my head the whole time.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   You're like, "Oh, they're over there now.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   They're over there."
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   That's my point.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.960]   And someone making a movie for it to show you the possibility.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   Then making a movie where people have to make money for that action.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   I just see that as a far off thing.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   You know, maybe somebody is paying them like, "Hey, make this one.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   You show the power of it."
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   It's happening.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:17.960]   It's going to be here.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.960]   It's soon.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.960]   Okay.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   I'm just anti this lifestyle.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960]   I like the world, my eyes work.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   I'm just like looking at things real dark.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   That's fair.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   That's actually really fair.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960]   I'm a grumpy old man.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.960]   I just don't care.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.960]   I didn't like 3D.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:31.960]   I thought 3D was a joke.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:32.960]   I don't like 3D.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.960]   I didn't like 3D.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.960]   This is not 3D.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   You're immersive.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   You're in the room with the actors as this happening and you're looking around and you're
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   going, "Wow.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   Oh my God, he's coming down from this Tom Cruise on a wire."
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960]   It'd be very exciting.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.960]   I don't know if this is something in my face.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   I don't know if this is something in my face.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:54.960]   Which is already hiring people in Hollywood to work with movie producers and directors.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   They could do something cool, but that's more augmented reality.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.960]   So that's like a whole other layer to try to figure out for the film industry.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:09.960]   Hopefully what will be so cool that will get us to spend whatever money it is to buy these
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   headsets will be something that we haven't even thought of.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.080]   Because right now a lot of the stuff we're talking about is what we know movies to be
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.120]   and then imagine that to be in a virtual reality headset and say, "Do I want to wear
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.640]   that thing on my face for two and a half hours?
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.640]   Do I not?"
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.480]   So hopefully there's something else that's a half hour.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.480]   Maybe it's half hour.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.240]   Maybe it won't be in the theater.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240]   Maybe lean Netflix doing it.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.040]   But think about the smartphone or the tablet or the PC.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.440]   Why did any of this stuff take off?
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.520]   It took off because it let you do something you couldn't do before.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.680]   Well, you can't do this.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.480]   But maybe there's still, I'm hoping, I'm just hoping there's something still in virtual
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.920]   reality that's out there that we don't haven't even thought up yet.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   That would be so cool.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.680]   I think it's the new Apple Beats Virtual Reality headset that O'Dr. has right now.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.680]   O'Dr. invented this.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.480]   It's the first thing you know.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480]   There it goes.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.280]   I'm selling these bad boys for 6K right now.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280]   6K.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.280]   You can't do this count.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.160]   Using the program to turn the twit.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.160]   Just go to my website.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.240]   You can imagine this from our chat from Alexandria, Virginia.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.800]   Daredevil.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.240]   You're watching Daredevil from Netflix.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.680]   And you can watch it on a flat screen or you could put on the helmet and now you're in
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.720]   that fight scene.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.560]   It would be cool for the fight scenes for sure.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.880]   Well, that's all Daredevil is.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.880]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.080]   Fight scenes, band and gym up.
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.480]   Another fight scene, bandage them up.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.480]   Another fight scene.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   It's worse than UFC.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.920]   At least the UFC is over quick.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:27.920]   Now, you know what?
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.920]   That's where you might get me.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.080]   Ooh, what if I could put you in the ring?
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.600]   You put me in the ring and or oh, there you go.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   You just sold me.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.520]   Put me in the ring with some classic fights where I'm Ollie and I beat somebody up and
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.880]   I just get to see somebody get knocked out like from a first perspective.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.480]   Some kind of or football or basketball game rock on the court.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.040]   That's where it's going to take a little punching machine that you could actually get
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040]   the punches.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.440]   You could feel like you're getting like punch.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.240]   Yeah, that's the future I want.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.960]   I can feel something, give me that 4D experience.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.680]   I want to smell burnt popcorn.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.480]   But I just like I just I just love life.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   I got my eyes lasered.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.360]   But that's like I could get glasses from in front of my face so I could be more close
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360]   to the world.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.360]   That's the point.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   That's my face.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.840]   You can't be in Vegas for the big fight except you can and you can be right in the
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.840]   middle of it.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:18.840]   This is what I mean.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.480]   Imagine sports when you're on the field or you're at Wimbledon and you're a line
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:26.680]   judge or I mean, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.320]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.720]   You just went to Germany, correct?
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.720]   Yes, sir.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:31.720]   I went to Germany.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.720]   Yes, sir.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.200]   Would you prefer to do this to Germany?
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.200]   No, I want to go to Germany.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.560]   But would you want to go to Germany?
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:41.120]   I admit, there are of course you would always prefer the life experience.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.240]   But how many times who has ever offered you to be sitting on the court at Wimbledon?
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.440]   There are some things that you're not going to get to do.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.560]   But you could like, you know, we could put a little thing in the studio here and you
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.880]   could be part of the twit and you could look around.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.240]   You could see what John's doing.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240]   You could see what's happening.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.160]   I know Jason's sitting there looking at a screw with a bunch of buttons.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.720]   There's people sitting on the chair watching you.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:04.720]   All right, maybe this isn't the best example.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.720]   All right.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:08.160]   It's a Super Bowl.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.360]   You could be on the 50 yard line of the Super Bowl.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.360]   It's giving you though.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.640]   I mean, even on TV, they've tried doing like the field cam where you're like behind the
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.840]   players and the thing that ESPN has on the string above the field.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.640]   Well, but it's just not a good way to watch sports.
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.040]   Like you've got the best angle.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.560]   I don't know because it bothers me a lot because I want to.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:29.960]   I'm watching Colin Kaepernick and I really want to see him make it his progressions.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.800]   And instead, the director decides, let's go see what the long safety is doing or something.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   And I'm saying, no, no, wait.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.440]   I want to watch.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.280]   Wouldn't it be great if during a game you could look around like you do?
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:45.800]   You know, if you go to a football game, nobody chooses the shots for you at the game.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.880]   If you watch your games on NFL.com or network, they've got all the camera angles.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.640]   You could pick which camera angle you want to watch.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.520]   Well, now put it in your helmet and you just look around.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.440]   Like I said, I'm a grumpy old man.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.560]   I know I'm a grumpy old man, but I just did something about this.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.880]   It captured my imagination.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.240]   You're both grumpy old men.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.240]   All right.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.240]   There's enough room for everybody.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.400]   You can agree on that.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.400]   Nate's.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:16.000]   Nate's Wall Street to cut $60 billion off the value of major media companies based on
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   this kind of cord cutting fear.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.200]   Who was it was talking at a conference and said?
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   ESPN.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.200]   It was ESPN.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.280]   They're revenues are down for the first time.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:32.440]   Sounds like the TV business is finally acknowledging that card cutting might impact their business
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.200]   over the long term, which until recently they were in real first denial mode about.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:43.160]   Well, it's confusing because you read these statistics ESPN, which is traditionally the
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.880]   cable channel people will pay the most for.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:51.160]   They make the most money, something like 625 per subscriber for them to make less is a
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   big deal.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.920]   But then you also hear statistics people are watching more broadcast television than ever
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.400]   before.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:02.520]   So I don't know which is true, but obviously media stocks really took a hit Walt Disney
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:08.120]   21st century Fox and a Viacom.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.160]   Although the CEO of cable vision said not so fast.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:13.160]   It's not.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.160]   It's not that bad.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:20.480]   You see, he told the Wall Street Journal, we don't see a landslide of corn cutting in the
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.120]   near term James Dolan.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.680]   Now, of course, he's talking to investors.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.080]   So he's trying to shore up the stock.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:30.200]   He says, I don't think the sky is falling quite yet.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:39.440]   Nevertheless, cable vision shares fell 2.7% on Friday and 5% over the two days.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:49.760]   Earlier, the key way to think about any of these changes is we are beginning to see a
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:56.640]   whole generation think about television, not as television, but something on demand.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:03.320]   And then you have a generation behind them who think of video only in terms of devices,
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.760]   which they can hold in their hand and they can touch.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.560]   I think that's exactly right.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:15.280]   And so 10 years forward, these guys may stem the losses for a little while, do some financial
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.280]   engineering.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.720]   10 years down the line, the behavior of the consumer is very different.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.600]   That's when it's not caught cutting.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.040]   It just is a different behavior.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.520]   You're not watching television at all.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:34.840]   And I think this whole notion that life sports is going to save their bacon and life events,
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840]   I don't know.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:44.240]   We don't know what the consumers of tomorrow are going to adapt to these things or not.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.360]   I don't know.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:51.880]   I am really interested in trying to figure out how people consume television in the next
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:57.040]   five years to actually make a reasonable call on what the future looks like.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.920]   But this one thing is for sure, the way things were, that's gone.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.800]   Like that, 60 billion or 600 billion in their market cap, that's irrelevant.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:12.400]   These companies have been sitting and doing absolutely nothing.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.440]   And that's why they are beginning to suffer.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.160]   Well, cable companies first and then networks nest.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.800]   I mean, I think the networks are in denial about the fact that people aren't even watching
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.800]   TV.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.800]   Go ahead, John, sir.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:28.600]   Yeah, there's been some really great stories about MLB, which was one of the first leaders,
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.920]   I think, in getting to the online space.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:36.280]   So the MLB TV people, Major League Baseball, were really trying to offer some kind of online
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.480]   experience early on.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.280]   They knew that they had a worldwide audience of people watching baseball who couldn't always
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.760]   watch it because they didn't have US network television.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.600]   So in the early days of MLB TV, it was awful.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.440]   It was like watching a pixelated video game frame by frame.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.880]   It was terrible, but they stuck with it and they developed it out.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.760]   And we're an MLB household.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.640]   So we use it quite frequently.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.480]   But three in the morning, unfortunately.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.240]   We have actually, I have to start the game because I'm allowed to see the final scores.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.240]   Ah.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.520]   So I'm in charge of starting the game.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.520]   I see.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.120]   But yeah, after the fact.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:21.680]   But what happened was HBO hired some people from MLB who had worked on that product.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.200]   HBO now was based on MLB.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.200]   Exactly.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:29.920]   And they said we really need somebody who has expertise and nobody had any expertise.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.720]   Including their own giant in-house, very expensive HBO go team up there in Seattle.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:36.720]   Right.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.720]   Well, left.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.440]   So I think and I think HBO has been a huge story this year.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:47.240]   Once they they offered that a la carte service, that's going to be a real I think it's going
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.360]   to set the tone for a lot of other channels.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.280]   ESPN went over the top with sling TV.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.560]   I think sling has been a big deal.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.280]   I think we'll look back at slang as having been really important.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.680]   I think the real problem is exactly his own points.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.880]   And I look at I have two kids, 23 and 21.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.840]   The 23 year old will watch Netflix will watch.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.360]   She'll sit down in front of a TV set.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.680]   She was not she's a court cutter and that said she's not watching live programming.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.080]   She's watching on demand programming off the internet.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.000]   The 21 year old won't do that.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.680]   He watches YouTube.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.320]   And that's it.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.160]   And I feel like that's really I mean, you're missing the boat.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   If you're thinking, oh, the next thing is over the top.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.320]   As I think you nailed it, which is TV watching itself has changed completely and people are
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.560]   using mobile devices.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.160]   They're not watching TV.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.960]   They're consuming content in some completely different way.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:49.160]   I think what it does is it, you know, it basically all the economics of our television
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.520]   and entertainment ecosystem is built on mass audience.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:54.520]   Right.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.520]   Right.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:03.880]   Moving into more, you know, like fractional audience over a long period of time and there
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:09.160]   will be hits and there will be some people who will do really well with the hits like,
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:13.760]   you know, HBO and true detective or Sopranos type of shows will.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.800]   So do you think there's a future for that kind of programming that kind of event programming?
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.800]   Absolutely.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.080]   I think great storytelling is great story telling.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:28.520]   Whether you tell them through, you know, you tell them as a poem or you tell them as a
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.920]   movie or as a, you know, running TV series, great stories are great story.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:39.680]   There will be far the focus has to be on finding that interesting thing that people
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:41.120]   are glued to.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.480]   But most of the viewing is going to be fractional.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:51.080]   So the economics of the industry changes not from mass audience, which is like mass audience,
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.720]   put lots of television, chart lots of money and go home.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:38:00.120]   Whereas fractional is everything is just, you know, up for grabs.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:07.240]   Maybe we need to be thinking really, really hard about paid content, subscription models,
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.880]   which are entirely different than what they are today.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:15.520]   I think Netflix works because it is actually an interesting business model, not because
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.120]   it has the best content.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:24.960]   It's like, they figured out that for $10 a month, people are okay putting up with, you
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.400]   know, a lot of average content, as long as they find something to see on a daily basis.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.120]   We don't really care as long as there's colors and people moving.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.400]   It doesn't really matter what it is.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.640]   But think about it this way.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:41.280]   How much time do you have in your day anymore?
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:47.080]   If to watch television, like, let's take what's happening in our society right now.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.840]   If you don't have full time jobs in the middle class, people are going to work two, three,
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.840]   four jobs.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.120]   They're going to do it, right?
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.640]   To make ends meet.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.480]   They're now watching television.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:03.400]   They will watch television within, you know, all these things they're doing and finding.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.520]   We'll have to steal time to entertain ourselves.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.360]   Does that mean short form is going to be more successful?
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.600]   Not like two minute videos, definitely.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.000]   But I'm sure, you know, there will be, like, somebody might come up with a new form.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.600]   It's hard to tell a story.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.360]   In fact, you're seeing really the opposite when you think about the fact that these HBO
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:26.760]   shows like Game of Thrones are true detective really are 30 or 40 hour movies.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.560]   They're not even two hour movies.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.240]   They're spread out, but they're a lot of hours.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.600]   We've gotten better at a long story arc than ever before.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   We like those long stories.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.160]   How about like a two hour news screen savers?
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.160]   It is two hours.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.160]   As a matter of fact.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.580]   Well, I feel like it's like half-opp
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.580]   Good.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.580]   I like it.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:50.580]   Thank you, home.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:51.580]   Rock on.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.240]   You know, when you start to look at some of the TV shows that are coming out exclusive
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:00.800]   on Vimeo and YouTube, I think they're breaking away from the idea of having a format at all.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.720]   They say, "Let us tell the story in the amount of time that we need."
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.720]   Oh, good.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.920]   So shows like High Maintenance, for example, which is on Vimeo.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.080]   And there's a few others that have very short programs.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.520]   I think that's a good experimental way to go, but I think we also have to remember that
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:21.160]   we've been programmed to consume content in certain blocks.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:26.560]   So a half hour show is usually actually somewhere between 22 and 26 minutes in the US because
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.560]   of commercial breaks.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:33.640]   And if you watch on Netflix, right, like you'll watch those 22 minutes straight through.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.600]   And then there's a difference between an hour long show on network, which is usually
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:43.760]   about 46 minutes and an hour long HBO show, which is actually more like 58, 59 minutes.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.280]   And I think we're acclimated to watching in those breaks and that writers start to get
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.880]   used to writing in those breaks, right?
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:56.320]   So you have 14 minutes until your plot twist and you have eight minutes of resolution.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.320]   You know what I mean?
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:02.440]   So I think we have some forms that are more ingrained in our behavior for consuming media
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.960]   than we realize.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.120]   And I would say the same thing about movies too.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.160]   So you know that the movie studios are pushing for a certain amount of time on a movie because
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.720]   they know that the consumer going to the theater wants a certain length of an experience to
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:17.800]   feel like they're getting their money's worth.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:23.920]   So writers are taught to pace their stories based on that block of time that they're given.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:29.240]   So I think some of those issues are going to be harder to overcome in new media.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:34.120]   I think new media that helps them a lot, but I think getting used to the idea that we,
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.120]   the consumer, want to have certain things happen in our story in the plotting and the pacing
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.760]   just because we've been accustomed to that.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.760]   That's the way that a story is true.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.240]   It might even be biological.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.760]   Ira Glass says that there's a natural of this American life.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:53.520]   This is a natural beat structure that's almost built into our biology of I think it's 45
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.520]   seconds.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.160]   He has a whole talk he does about this natural structure.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.160]   You know what comes to mind?
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:02.080]   This is very similar to our conversation about messaging earlier, which is essentially
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:07.520]   that we're moving into a fragmented world where there are lots of different flavors
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.040]   and you pick the flavor that suits you.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.240]   I'm looking at high maintenance.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:12.240]   It's interesting.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.320]   This is on Vimeo.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320]   It's a series.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.320]   If you watch this, Jill, is a series.
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:19.160]   Yeah, I've seen a little bit of it.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.840]   It's a $1.99 episode.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.920]   It's just the same as like a real TV show.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.600]   It is a real TV show.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.600]   But it's on Vimeo.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.880]   Yeah, so that doesn't mean anything.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.880]   Right?
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.880]   I guess you're right.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.840]   And we as in our chat room keep saying you guys are missing the point.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.040]   It's about cost.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.160]   The cable companies are charging us so much.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.160]   We're just trying to save money.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.640]   I don't think that's the case.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.520]   I think that is that there is that is the case.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.520]   It is.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.840]   They keep charging for things we don't want.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.400]   You know, people feel happily paper.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.680]   It's a point, right?
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.240]   It's much like the music industry selling you an album when you only wanted one song.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.960]   Yeah, except as you can go out a cart, you will.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.320]   It's like a hundred channels you will never ever watch, at least if you buy an album.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.200]   I don't think that's all by the same person.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.840]   I do think we're willing to pay for our content though.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:06.840]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:10.560]   I think that people don't want free content.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.920]   If it's good content, I think people will pay for Game of Thrones.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.920]   HBO now, as far as I can tell, is a success, right?
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:21.840]   HBO is doing well because it's set the standard so very high that people are willing to pay
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:22.840]   for it.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.160]   Well, not everybody can be HBO or New York Times, right?
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.400]   Let's be very, very clear.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.840]   Well, that's the scarcity, frankly, is talent.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.560]   That's the scarcity of acting.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:39.840]   I think HBO has done a great job of maintaining quality and being very clear about what they
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.840]   stand for.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:46.720]   I think New York Times has done a good job so far, but I see that they're starting to
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.920]   go down this path.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.160]   It's stumbling, yeah.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:55.120]   Yeah, that they're starting to miss out who they really are and why we are willing to
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.320]   pay for them.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.560]   I think that's the other thing.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:06.560]   The thing which we have never talked about or people don't talk about is how storytelling
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:13.440]   it will actually be different going forward because the technology is different, right?
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.040]   You know, Jill was talking about 26-minute blocks or 58-minute blocks, but think about
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:20.040]   it this way.
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:28.400]   Today, we can stop and have a video synced to another screen at any time.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.280]   So we don't watch.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.360]   I have not sat down and watched a single movie, you know, end to end.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:39.120]   Like I just maybe watched 10 minutes there and 15 minutes there.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.120]   Well, you're right.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.880]   Interstellar, which I watched in the theater, was interminable in the theater, but we watched
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.800]   it over three nights again and it was great.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   Right?
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:48.800]   Three chunks.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.360]   And that's where the storytelling is different, right?
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:58.280]   That's where the idea of what is video content is different, you know, the idea of television
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.840]   as we know it doesn't make any sense because we are in full control of how we experience
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.160]   it, right?
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.120]   How we experience it defines what is going to happen to the medium and it is not going
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.280]   to be a mass medium as a result of that.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:20.520]   And I think the most of the television industry misses the point about that, completely misses
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.680]   the point that we are in charge.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:29.120]   Like we mean the end customer is in charge of how that's the beauty.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.480]   I think people talk about caught cutting.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:35.040]   DVR was the most disruptive thing that happened to tell them.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.640]   Yes, as soon as you didn't have to watch it live, everything changed.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.320]   And you could and you could pause it and let's not forget you could skip commercials.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:50.120]   And that's a that's a big issue for advertisers and the and the monetization.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   Do you think we're going to go pay wall?
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.040]   We're going to everything will be for pay that the idea of free advertising supported
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.960]   media is threatened by this song.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.960]   I don't know.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:07.480]   I mean, I sometimes I'm hoping you say no because that's what we're doing here today.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.200]   Okay, no.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.000]   I knew I should go into that preaching thing.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.560]   I really feel like that I blew I missed.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.360]   Yeah, miss the bet.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.040]   Yeah, I mean, you're doing a good job, though.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.040]   A preaching.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.400]   Well, you know, if there's a thread in the through line through all of this is that the
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:32.480]   technology is completely disruptive and are what's really interesting is human behavior
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:38.360]   is as much disrupted as the, you know, the business models.
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.160]   Business models have to accommodate these new human behaviors and it's hard.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.880]   It's a moving target.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:45.240]   I watch, you know, I watch my kid.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:49.880]   I love using my kids as an example, but I watch them go from as, you know, when we
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:52.000]   were teenagers, we were on the phone while we did our homework.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.480]   I watched my daughter be on instant messenger while I was doing, she was doing her homework
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:01.440]   with music, playing to watching my son be on a multiple conference call with Skype while
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:02.440]   he's doing his homework.
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.160]   I mean, and that's in a couple of years.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.680]   It's changing so rapidly.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:12.040]   I don't blame NBC and via common and ESPN Disney for having some trouble figuring out
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.160]   what the hell we want and where it's all going by the time they do figure it out.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.560]   Well, one something else.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.400]   Oh my God.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.120]   And Jason Snell is here.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.720]   I'm being haunted by my past from six colors.com has also gone the freelance.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.120]   And it's odd because it looks like I couldn't be.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.920]   John C. de Vorek is standing behind you right now.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.160]   That's, that's, I'm going, I have a nightmare.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.160]   It's like this.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.960]   And there's more than going on.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.080]   I can leave and take this lens with me.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.360]   Could you come back next week?
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.520]   That's when we thought you would be here.
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.520]   But no, you know, I'm thrilled.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.520]   You're giving my lens.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.520]   You get the 45.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.760]   I'll talk about that later.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:49.760]   Come on and have a seat.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.760]   We didn't expect you.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.760]   Actually, we were worried.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.800]   We thought maybe you thought you were supposed to be here this week.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.800]   I did.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.800]   That's good.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.720]   You can be here this weekend next week if you want.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.440]   You can be here as many weeks as you want.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:02.760]   Oh, John going to make normally John sits there.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.760]   This is John Spott.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.000]   How do you feel about sitting over here?
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000]   I don't want to sitting over here.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000]   It might throw me.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.800]   Well, they good.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800]   Everything you say might be right.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800]   You don't want to be there.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800]   I'm starting over Wednesday to come in.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.880]   We were talking about next week because we had arranged a show just for you with your favorite
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.880]   people.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:19.880]   Oh.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.120]   Old white old men.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.120]   You want this?
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:23.120]   Yeah, but I don't have the 45.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.120]   You got the white.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.120]   You're the white old man.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.720]   I didn't expect you this week.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:27.720]   Oh.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:28.720]   Oh.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.120]   Well, I'm saying that because I brought this lens.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.120]   Thank you.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.120]   I appreciate it.
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:33.120]   God, it's hot.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.120]   Is it hot out there?
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.120]   No, not really.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.040]   John C. de Vorak from No Agenda Show.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.040]   You're a computer somebody.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.040]   Yeah, we'll get your computer.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.360]   deVorak.org/block.
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.600]   And finally, but last and certainly not least from Mashable Christina Warren is also
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.600]   here.
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.600]   Hello.
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:52.400]   Unfortunately, you've been slid out over onto the edge.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.720]   So we're going to have some pineapple tarts if you'd like.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720]   I don't think so.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:56.920]   I brought them just for you.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   No, you didn't.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.760]   You didn't expect me to be here apparently.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.040]   Yeah, but how is it that I had pineapple tarts you made out?
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.400]   I don't like pineapple tarts, so they wouldn't be for me.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.400]   All right.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.400]   You want to try one?
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.600]   I don't even know what they are.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.840]   So, wow, that's great.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.440]   Nice to see you.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.840]   Good to be here on the wrong day.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.840]   That's good.
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.840]   No, but you know what?
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.280]   I could tell you, we have a vast studio that's larger than usual because it's air conditioning
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.280]   inside.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.120]   And they're thrilled, right?
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.960]   They practice it was an audible gasp when he walked in the room.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:28.960]   Like they were at Seoul.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.160]   Yes, that's like the ghost of Marlon.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.560]   Just screw something up.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.560]   Big time.
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:34.560]   Okay, here you go.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.200]   I love deVorak such a character.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.080]   I told him that he should drop in anytime.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.080]   And I'm convinced he will do that at some point.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.520]   He's been invited to be on Twitter many times since he says, I'll be on when I've done my
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.520]   vinegar book.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.480]   So he's still worked on the vinegar book, but we will have John C on Twitter as soon
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:50:00.040]   as he but I'm fully expecting and I hope he might drop in anytime.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.760]   You never know with deVorak.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.280]   We're going to take a break.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:10.080]   Come back with a few more memories from 2015, but first a word from Citrix go to meeting.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.160]   Look, if you're a business, you have to have meetings.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160]   meetings are really vital.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.160]   They break through.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:20.000]   They kind of cut the Gordian knot of confusion.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.240]   We kind of have a rule that if more than three emails are exchanged on any topic, we say,
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:25.240]   that's it.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.240]   No more emails.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.240]   Let's talk.
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.040]   Meetings are a great place to brainstorm to get work done if they're managed properly.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:37.600]   But part of the problem nowadays is teams are distributed all over and so are your clients,
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.000]   right?
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.720]   That means a lot of travel if you want to meet or it means Citrix go to meeting.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.720]   Eliminate the travel.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.040]   Meet more efficiently.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.720]   Get more done.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.080]   Co-workers love it, but clients love it too because you're not taking up their time.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.240]   If you have a sales presentation, you want a system that's going to make it easy for
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.920]   them to see what you're doing.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.120]   A system that lets you look at them and them look at you.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.120]   That's really important.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.120]   We're human beings.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.600]   We need to see each other's faces.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.600]   Go to meeting.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:07.480]   Does that the HD quality webcam makes it seem like you're in the room.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.520]   You share your screen so they can see your PowerPoint.
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.400]   You could collaborate on documents together.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.360]   You get feedback in real time and it is super easy.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:19.560]   You don't want to make a client jump through hoops to be in your meeting, to be in your
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.800]   sales pitch.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:23.520]   With go to meeting, they get an invitation in the email.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.600]   It gets added to the calendar.
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.120]   They click a link.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:28.920]   The software is automatically instantly installed.
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.360]   They're ready to go.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.360]   No fuss.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.440]   No fuss.
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.440]   And here's the great part.
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:37.120]   You can not only meet from a computer, but your tablet, your smartphone.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.600]   I can present from an iPad anywhere in the world.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.040]   With go to meeting, everybody sees what you're seeing, so you're on the same page and you
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.360]   see each other face to face.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.980]   You get that real personal contact.
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:49.920]   This is the solution.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.080]   You may have tried others.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.640]   I want you to try go to meeting today.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.040]   I think you'll agree.

[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:56.800]   There's no offer code or anything.
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.000]   Just go to the website, go to meeting.com.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.240]   Click the try it free button.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.680]   Citrix go to meeting.

[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:06.120]   Click the try it free button.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:10.560]   Your first meeting will be ready in minutes before the show's over.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.880]   Your clients will love you for it.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:15.360]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.480]   Click the try it free button for 30 days.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.560]   Free.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:29.640]   This was a big story and a story that I think kind of galvanized the world on both sides.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:37.520]   It wasn't a big story in the sense that was a massive terrorist attack.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.840]   It wasn't the world cup.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:42.280]   It wasn't a story like that, but it was a story that really captured people's interest
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:43.760]   and imagination.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.880]   We spent a lot of time talking about, of course, Ahmed and his clock, the high school student
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.840]   who was busted for a clock that looked like a bomb.
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:53:00.920]   Owen J. J. Stone's back, oh, doctor, Larry Maggud from CBS, Aaron Griffith.
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:03.920]   Here's the story of Ahmed and the clock.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:07.360]   Little 14-year-old Ahmed brings a clock.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:12.640]   Actually, what he does, we found out, is he takes apart a clock, a clock that was very
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:18.840]   popular, like Radio Shack in the '80s, takes it apart, jiggers it around with it, brings
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:21.920]   it into school to show his engineering teacher.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.920]   He's brand-new.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:23.920]   He's a freshman.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.920]   Brand-new at this high school.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.560]   He kind of wants to establish himself.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.040]   The engineering teacher looks at it and says, "That's very nice.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.600]   Put it away and do not show anybody your clock."
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.880]   Unfortunately, the clock makes some noise in another class.
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:37.800]   The teacher says, "What's that?"
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.080]   He's got it in a case, a metal case.
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.280]   He opens it up.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.400]   Teacher freaks out.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.720]   Principal comes, grabs the kid, brings him back.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:54.120]   They call the police assigned to that school, because the school has official police officers.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:58.480]   The police come, they question him, which, by the way, is not legal procedure without
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.840]   his parents present.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.480]   Hand cuff him and take him in.
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:07.800]   His parents are called before he has to serve any time in a jail cell or anything.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:10.440]   He's taken home.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.480]   Very controversial and became a cause to labor.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:18.520]   When the president said, "Hey, I'm at cool clock, come to the White House," one of the
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.720]   reasons it's a hot button is because Irving Texas is not exactly a bastion of tolerance.
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:32.960]   I think it was the mayor of Irving Texas made a pretty scandalous anti-Muslim speech.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.280]   I think there's a little bit of sensitivity there.
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:37.200]   It was clearly not a bomb.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.600]   The kid never said it was a bomb.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.680]   The kid repeatedly said it was a clock.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:47.120]   In fact, one of the police officers perhaps foolishly said, "Well, it looks like a movie
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.120]   bomb to me," because of course in the movies they always have a big clock on the bomb so
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:57.040]   that the hero can disarm the bomb with 007 seconds left.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.840]   But in fact, if you were going to make a bomb, a couple of things.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.000]   First, you probably wouldn't put a big clock on it.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.280]   Second, you might put some explosives in it.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.280]   It was obvious.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.040]   No explosives in the bomb.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:14.120]   I loved the fact that after this story came out, somebody reminded me that in the Walter
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:20.000]   Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs, Wozniak tells a story of doing almost exactly the same
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]   thing in high school.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000]   He took a metronome.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000]   He liked how it went, clicked, clicked, clicked, clicked.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.400]   It was an electronic metronome.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:27.680]   He put it in a locker and he wired it up so that if you open the locker, it would speed
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:30.680]   up.
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.680]   It stripped the labels off of a couple of batteries because he knew he's a smart guy.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:37.800]   A bomb requires explosives to look like explosives.
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:40.480]   He made something to really look like a bomb.
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.720]   A guy called in the principal's office and couldn't help but laugh when the principal
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.520]   said, "Is this a bomb?"
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.280]   He said, "No, it's not a bomb."
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:50.120]   He spent a night in juvie.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:51.440]   Of course, it's Woz.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:56.720]   So he taught the other inmates how to strip the wires from the electrical lighting and
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:59.400]   wire it to the bars in the window.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.720]   So it would zap anybody who touched them.
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.040]   Woz went on to fame at Fortune.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:05.480]   I think Ahmed might too.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.480]   He's been offered.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.880]   A lot of things as a result.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.720]   How much clock didn't work, so let's just start with that.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.760]   I was not putting them in the Woz category.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.920]   I mean, we've got a whole bunch of gadgets and toys but they did make a clock.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.120]   Not only was it not a bomb but the clock didn't clock.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:23.120]   Did it not work?
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.120]   It's not with you.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.120]   No, it probably didn't clock.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.120]   I didn't read that part.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.120]   It was a real time.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.760]   The clock wasn't fully functional.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.560]   It wasn't worked properly on top of the fact that you made the clock.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.560]   Aaron, I think your mic's on.
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:34.560]   Yeah, you muted.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:36.560]   Thank you, Aaron.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:37.560]   I muted.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:45.760]   Aaron is using the best mic stand we've ever seen on this show, which is a cardboard box.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.760]   But unfortunately...
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.760]   No, we're not hearing.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:49.760]   Suddenly.
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.560]   We didn't say it on our side.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.880]   Is it our microphone?
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.760]   So let me ask you, O.D.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.160]   I'm not the word of the microphone.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.000]   Is this an example of engineering while Brown?
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.160]   Is there racism or anti-Muslim feeling behind this?
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.160]   First of all, the fact the way that they treated this child was wrong.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:12.720]   Once you even realized it wasn't a bomb, you still questioned him without his parents,
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.720]   their or a lawyer there.
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:16.440]   And he repeatedly asked for somebody called my parents.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.440]   They didn't.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:21.200]   Secondly, somebody posted up there, okay, so Wozniak actually made a bomb.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.200]   He goes to a juvie.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.200]   That's the proper thing to do, whatever.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:26.800]   But somebody else posted a thing where they were like seven other kids that did the exact
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.400]   same thing in other schools across the country.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.640]   And some of the incidents, somebody even thought it was a bomb.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.840]   They weren't caught on it, caught their parents, whatever.
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.720]   It was quowed in like five minutes.
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.000]   Although, I don't know if you can use that as an example because we can also pull up
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.840]   examples of kids who pointed their finger like a gun and got suspended.
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:49.360]   I mean, this is unevenly enforced across the nation.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:53.840]   It's sad because in the post-9/11 world, people are scared.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.640]   I have to think it has a little to do with the fact that the kid has apparently an Arabic
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.280]   sounding name.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.280]   Yes.
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.280]   Right?
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.280]   And where he lives.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.520]   If he lived in New York, well, I guess New York's not a good place to call that.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:10.400]   But because New York is New York too.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:11.720]   It's just sad.
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:14.280]   Whether it's racist or not, it's just sad.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.720]   I don't blame the teacher for being concerned.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:22.440]   But once the police showed up and determined it wasn't a bomb, it seemed to me it should
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.440]   have been over.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:27.280]   And second of all, if they had to take him out of the classroom, why do you put handcuffs
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:29.120]   on a skinny little 14 year old kid?
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.520]   I mean, that's just ridiculous to begin with.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:38.120]   Once you put it in the teacher, I think maybe had a cause to at least want to look into
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:40.640]   this to make sure it was okay, but then move on.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.240]   But the cops, I think, way overreacted.
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:47.160]   If you need to put handcuffs on the kid, then that whole school needs to be evacuated.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.680]   You don't stand around getting pictures taken in the office.
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.320]   Because if you really think that it's about the point where this kid needs to be locked
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:55.440]   up, that school should be a ghost town ASAP.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:59.840]   But they stood around talking, yipping in the app and asking the same questions over and
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:03.320]   over again, knowing it wasn't a threat, but treating it like it was a threat.
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:04.320]   It was just poorly handled.
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:07.680]   So whether it was race or not, he gets free guidance and toys out of it.
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:09.360]   He gets to go some cool places.
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.360]   He's not going back to school.
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:14.440]   You may celebrity and you guys look like idiots in our school system.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440]   It's just sad.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.240]   It's so annoying that I got to see this kid get all this stuff because he made a broken
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.040]   clock and that is a big deal.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.000]   It shouldn't even be a big deal.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000]   All right.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.440]   Well, I think part of the president's point is to encourage kids to be maker if into tinker
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.000]   and to do things like that.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000]   That's cool.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.080]   Whether this kid is exceptional as people are making him out to be and whether he deserves
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:39.840]   a job in Silicon Valley or a free ticket to MIT, I don't know.
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:43.200]   I mean, it seems to me he ought to be competing for those spots like the rest of the kids
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200]   do.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.240]   But we basically made a martyr out of him for a moment and then he came to celebrity.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.240]   So good for him.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:54.400]   Well, he's certainly getting more benefit than he's getting the momentary embarrassment
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.200]   and pain of being arrested.
[01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.480]   He's been invited to the White House.
[01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.760]   He will be going.
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:03.960]   He received a message of support from Hillary Clinton and offered a stop by Facebook to
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:07.720]   me, Mark Zuckerberg, an invitation to be an intern at Twitter and I think even MIT got
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.440]   involved.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:15.560]   Some have said though, and the New York Post's a bastion of journalistic sensibility at
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:20.240]   Kyle Smith writing how Ahmed's clock became a false convenient tale of racism.
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:23.120]   There's been a backlash.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:26.920]   And a couple of points will kind of lay to rest here.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.320]   People pointing out, in fact, we had the guy on the news screensavers yesterday, works
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:36.800]   at Make Magazine, who was the first to observe, oh, that isn't like a homemade clock.
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:40.920]   That's a disassembled clock that you could buy at Radio Shack in the 80s.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:41.920]   I even had one.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.760]   It was a Microntha clock, I think.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:47.280]   That doesn't mean he's not a maker.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.280]   That's how makers start.
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:49.280]   That's how you start.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.400]   You take apart stuff.
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:51.760]   You assemble it.
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.320]   Richard Dawkins of all people weighed in saying, yeah, I think the guy was trying to go viral.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:02.720]   This was an intentional viral thing that he knew what the response would be.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:04.800]   I don't know if I buy that either.
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:08.160]   Listen, this, Uncle Leo, take that one step even deeper.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:13.760]   Imagine foil on my head and say, what if he, Ahmed, is a Manchurian candidate and you
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.800]   figured the best way to get to the president is to get a Muslim on him.
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.720]   He'd be sure to have a clock with him.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:21.120]   And then you get him to visit Facebook.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.120]   He says down Facebook.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.320]   He says down better.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.840]   He says down to White House propaganda, man.
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.840]   The world is out there.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:28.840]   Did he?
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:29.840]   I mean, a couple of questions.
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:33.520]   First of all, if he never ever, if he always said it's a clock, it's a clock.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:37.800]   Surely teachers must have looked at this and apparently teachers are.
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:42.520]   What is, okay, there's literacy if you don't know words, numeracy if you don't know numbers.
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:45.400]   What is it if you don't understand technology at all?
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.120]   The technology literacy.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:52.240]   The illiterate because they looked at this and even thought it might be a bomb when there's,
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:56.720]   there's, you know, the first thing that comes to my mind, where's the explosive, right?
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:59.440]   There's nothing that could blow up.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:05.520]   So what it, what it shows is that unfortunately he's got teachers who don't understand that
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:07.600]   this is what the inside of a clock looks like.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.160]   They've never gone inside anything.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.200]   Teacher, if that teacher should be taught how to build bombs so that they would know in
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.120]   the future what a bomb looks like.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:17.120]   Yeah.
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.520]   And the police who said it looks like a movie bomb to me.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:21.520]   Right.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:22.520]   That's just sad.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:25.000]   So they knew they figured out very quickly that it wasn't a bomb.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000]   Of course they knew it wasn't a bomb.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000]   They didn't clear the school.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000]   That was a ridiculous thing.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.760]   Why did the guy win handcuffs?
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.880]   Why didn't they say false alarm goodbye?
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:32.880]   Well, very much.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.880]   Go back to class.
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:34.880]   Shut up.
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.920]   If he had, if they thought this, this kid was pretending it was a bomb that was a hoax
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.840]   and was kind of trying to scare people with, then it might have been appropriate to do that,
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:43.840]   right?
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.840]   Apparently, he said repeatedly it's not a bomb.
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.840]   It's not a bomb.
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:47.840]   It's not a bomb.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.840]   You know, it's just sad.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.000]   Like I said, I had to go take my little bits away from my daughter for a week.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.320]   I'm like, we can't make anything.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:54.320]   What?
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.000]   Like, you know, I just got a, you didn't do that.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000]   I did too.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000]   Paranoid man, she's brown.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000]   She's brown.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.760]   Are you afraid that she'll bring something to school and the same thing will happen to
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:02.760]   her?
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:06.040]   I do not let her take electronic school, not because I was worried about that per se.
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:09.840]   I was more worried about either kids stealing the stuff because she's got cool things more
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.040]   so than anything else.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:17.120]   But you know, it's sad that you have a daughter who, gosh darn it, is wonderful, who is playing
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.240]   with electronics, who is using little bits, who is learning about that stuff.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:24.600]   What kind of lesson I hate to say does she get out of us?
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.480]   She thought she must have seen this story, right?
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:27.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:30.360]   Well, she was really upset because she wants to be an engineer and she was like, well,
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:31.360]   why did he get in trouble?
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:32.360]   Why is such a big deal?
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.440]   Like, and you know, you try to explain to a kid what they thought it was something dangerous.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:39.200]   And the first question a kid asked is simple stuff.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:41.560]   Well, when they found out it wasn't, it was the big deal.
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:42.560]   Why are we talking about it?
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.400]   And I said, I don't know.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:47.160]   It's the number one error here just to lack a common sense really.
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.840]   I mean, isn't that really what's it going to look like?
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:49.840]   They just took it too far.
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.520]   Like I said, if they were to just stopped, if you wouldn't have broken his rights, that's
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.520]   why people talk about race.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.680]   It's like, they're like, it's like, okay, well, you're not supposed to be questioning
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:58.680]   this kid.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:03:59.800]   You already knew it wasn't a bomb.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.800]   He's asking for his parents.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.160]   He's telling you what it's not.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:04.680]   And you're still handcuffing him and grilling him.
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:05.680]   Like, come on.
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:07.360]   At some point, do your job.
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:08.520]   You're a police officer.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.680]   You have a job to do.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.680]   Rules to follow.
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.280]   Follow the rules.
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.680]   Maybe they didn't want to have been such a big deal.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.320]   But when you take it past certain point, it's a problem.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.480]   Have you ever been accused of driving while black?
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.720]   Of course.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.720]   You get pulled over?
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:26.520]   All the time, nine times this year.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:31.160]   I'm not going to have been put over in the last, I've been put over in the last two and
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.160]   a half months.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:35.520]   But for the first six months of this year, I was put over on average every 17 days.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:38.280]   I got one ticket out of those nine stops.
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:39.880]   They were just checking you out.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:42.440]   I live in a very nice neighborhood.
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:43.440]   And I bought a new car.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.880]   Apparently my car looks nice.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:48.200]   Yeah, I have a friend in the same situation.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.560]   Driving while we black, driving in Mercedes in a rich town.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.720]   And he gets pulled over all the time.
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:54.640]   The guy was like, oh, your tail lights out.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.640]   I'm like, it's a 2015.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:56.640]   My tail lights aren't out.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:59.480]   I was like, if you come back with the ticket for a tail light, I'm getting out and taking
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.640]   a videotape of it.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:02.720]   He comes back, oh, I'll give you a warning for that tail light.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:03.720]   Get a fix.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:06.600]   And I'm like, okay, stuff like that happens.
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.600]   Did you read?
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:11.120]   And Tina, he see Coates book.
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:13.120]   No.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.880]   Are you interested in reading it?
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.080]   I'm about to go look it up.
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.080]   So yes.
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:18.320]   She told me I should read something.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.480]   Yeah, you should.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.400]   He wrote a book for his son, basically.
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.320]   He's an African American.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:27.040]   I think he's a journalist.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.560]   Is he an educator?
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.160]   Yeah, he's a staff writer at the Atlantic writer.
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:33.560]   Oh, hey, we got you back, Aaron.
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:34.560]   Yay.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.560]   I'm sure you have quite a few things that you would like to say about this.
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:41.040]   And we you guys kind of you guys kind of covered it.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.040]   All right.
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:43.040]   Anything to add?
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:45.960]   What do you where do you come down on this?
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:51.080]   Is this I mean, on the one hand, you could just say, look, I'm trying to be reasonable.
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.240]   Everybody got scared.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:53.240]   The kid.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   Okay.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.800]   Yeah, his name is Mohammed.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:57.200]   He's brown.
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:58.200]   We don't know.
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:06:00.080]   Maybe he's wears a turban at home at night.
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:02.840]   He made something that looks a little weird.
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:04.480]   We were scared.
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:07.320]   So we just want to check it out.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:11.640]   I mean, the whole thing is really frustrating to watch out, but I think to watch it play
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:12.640]   out.
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:18.640]   But the thing that that frustrates me the most about it is that these incidents continue
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:21.680]   to play out the exact same way on the internet.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:24.840]   You know, there's outrage and then there's outrage to the outrage.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.840]   Yeah.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:26.840]   Then there are truth.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.280]   Then there are truth errors that come out and they have the he wasn't a model citizen.
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.280]   He didn't make the book.
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:32.640]   His parents made it or whatever.
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:39.040]   And it's the same pattern and people on both sides of the argument just reinforce their
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:40.520]   own beliefs.
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:44.200]   And it's just a reflection of the filter bubble that we have on the internet.
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:46.960]   I just googled this as we were talking about it.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:51.320]   And the top stories now, because the original outrage has kind of died down because it happened
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:52.320]   earlier in the week.
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:58.000]   And the top stories now are all sort of like right wing truthers that are like Ahmed didn't
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.600]   make the clock and this is just another sort of liberal uprising.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.600]   All of this stuff.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.920]   And it's just sort of frustrating to watch play out because as soon as it happened, I
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.880]   was just like, Oh, brother, here goes.
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.880]   Everybody's got to get their clicks.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:16.480]   And it doesn't feel like anyone really learned anything.
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:20.880]   It doesn't feel like this is not going to happen again now as a result of this.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:21.880]   It's going to happen again.
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:23.680]   And that's what I said is just sad.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:27.960]   When you say like whether there's racism, the problem is that it was a problem.
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:31.000]   Like, you know, okay, as a school, you were scared.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.320]   Okay, do your job file procedure and end it.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:37.360]   But taking it to the umpteenth degree is the problem.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.840]   You know, because kids get, I think kids get arrested in my school for all kinds of
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:41.840]   stuff.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.880]   I've had a kid in my high school who had a gun.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:44.880]   And guess what?
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.880]   The cops came to their residence.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:46.880]   It was over in 30 seconds.
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:50.000]   I had another kid who had a pocket comb knife.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.520]   They realized it was a knife.
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:52.520]   The cops left.
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:53.520]   Everybody was fine.
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:55.200]   There was never a big deal about it.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:58.600]   But when you take it and you handcuff the kid once you already know, the problem is over.
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:02.200]   Like those are the things where it's like, well, now we got Facebook and there's a Facebook
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:05.040]   mom group that says not my child, never again.
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.200]   And they've got like a billion people to go.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:09.760]   Like you said, the way it plays out is just like who needs their clicks.
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:10.760]   And it becomes national news.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:11.760]   Yeah.
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:12.760]   Yeah, I need clicks for it.
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:13.760]   I need clicks against it.
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:14.760]   I need clicks in the middle.
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:16.080]   I need clicks for the clicks that you got earlier.
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.000]   So let's get clicks.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.360]   Everybody make a money out the Leo.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.360]   Take that ad blocker.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:23.200]   Takes on takes on takes on takes.
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:24.200]   Yes.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.600]   No, it's not a dislike button.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:27.600]   I know.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:28.680]   It's an empathy button.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.680]   An empathy button.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:31.680]   Thank you, Eric.
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:33.720]   It's a troll button is what it is.
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:35.280]   No, because the problem is.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.440]   It's going to be like slack.
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:38.360]   Eric's going to be like, Eric's absolutely right.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:39.360]   It's going to be like slack.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:42.440]   It's going to be like, you know, you can react with a little emoji.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.760]   There's probably going to be lots of different kinds.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:47.480]   Can you don't somebody want to like it?
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:48.480]   You want to acknowledge?
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:49.480]   I hear you.
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:50.480]   I feel that happened to me recently.
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:56.520]   I think that they probably think that because people don't feel awkward sharing, you know,
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.720]   uncomfortable or bad news on Facebook because they don't want people to like it, you know,
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.480]   they don't want to think about how many licenses can I get?
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:08.000]   I think that it's preventing people from sharing some of the more, you know, difficult
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000]   or intimate things.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.360]   And Facebook wants to stop anything that could ever hinder sharing.
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:17.000]   So I mean, ultimately it's all about more engagement or whatever, but it's just another
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.920]   mode of communication, a passive communication.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:20.920]   What is it going to look like?
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:24.920]   Is it going to be like a shrug?
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:25.920]   A shrug.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:27.920]   It's been a long term project.
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:28.920]   But they haven't.
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:36.160]   I think what's stopping them is what's the hell is the icon going to look like?
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.400]   They're trying to figure it out.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:38.400]   Right.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:41.840]   I mean, how hard could it be to implement they own the platform?
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.400]   All they have to do is turn it on.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.960]   It could choose from any of the hundreds of emojis, you know, there's like the, the
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.960]   hands up, the hands up.
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:54.760]   The handshake, you know, what is that hands up emoji really mean though?
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.760]   I don't know.
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:01.720]   I there's an official term for it is like, or actually, sorry, I can't even remember.
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:05.720]   There was, there's been lots of articles exploring what those hands up mean.
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.960]   And I think it's supposed to be like Japanese.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:08.960]   It's celebration.
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:11.560]   It's celebration is excitement.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.680]   But I just think some sometimes I get people more credit than that.
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:18.920]   A friend of mine fell broker face over, she had a picture in the hospital and her face,
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:19.920]   she looked bad.
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:24.760]   There weren't any likes, but she had like 130 comments people saying wish you well, all
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:25.760]   that kind of stuff.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.760]   Like I feel like how is it going to still promote something when it's diluted?
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:33.560]   So if like 30 people want to go and say it's funny or 30 people want to be angry at it and
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.960]   say, oh, this is, you know, I'm against Donald Trump.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:39.400]   Like how is it going to get that congruency of either it's got a lot of comments or it's
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:40.400]   got a lot of likes.
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:41.400]   Like is it.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:45.080]   And the new one, I think the ideal would be that people wouldn't be commenting because
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.680]   they're commenting because they want to acknowledge it, but they don't want to like it.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.480]   And the new one, the idea would be, or the new, this new sort of iteration, the idea
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:57.560]   would be there wouldn't be so many comments, but there would be, you know, reactions that
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.160]   were like, you know, condolences feel better.
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:04.960]   We're sorry or, you know, a variety of reactions like that.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:05.960]   And not really.
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:10.320]   If you use Slack, they're doing this now where you can react with like lots of different
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.320]   emoji, but it doesn't.
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.240]   I like comments a lot more than I like likes.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.560]   I mean, frankly, I like feeling lazy.
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:23.120]   And if I really care, I'll comment and mostly what I do on Facebook, I'm not going to type
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:24.120]   anything.
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:26.160]   And I'm just going to go, hey, thumbs up.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.720]   But I like it when people take a moment to actually know.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:30.120]   But I don't have time for that.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:31.120]   I'm busy.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:32.520]   We don't express ourselves anymore.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:33.520]   Hey, how you doing today?
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:35.600]   I got another cat video to look at.
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:37.400]   I don't have time to type a comment.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:40.400]   They're called one to have a grunt.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:41.960]   Oh, that's what we need.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:48.720]   Actually, I was thinking we should have a and, uh, and, but to see a mojo.
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:52.240]   Well, okay, by the way, I've learned something today.
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:53.400]   Emojipedia.
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.600]   Emojipedia.org is a wiki all about emojis.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:02.200]   This is called the hallelujah emoji.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:11.600]   Also knows the magic emoji, praise hands emoji, Festivus miracle emoji, or two hands emoji.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:17.280]   And actually, you know, depending on who's doing your emoji illustration with apple,
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.040]   it's just two hands and a bunch of confetti.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.360]   Is that the Google one, the weird necklace one?
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.080]   The Google one is the one, uh, apples, the top one with the necklace.
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.200]   The Google one is the, no, that's like a person with no neck.
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.080]   Oh, necklace, not necklace.
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:34.080]   I got it.
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:35.080]   Yeah.
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.200]   No, the no neck guy is a is Android.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:41.520]   Uh, Microsoft has a gray ghost, which is really weird.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.240]   Uncle Leo to make you happy.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:46.320]   I'm going to tuck my mic off and start doing rest and shit like this.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.880]   So that's, is that empathy?
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:51.080]   Is that what is that?
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:52.080]   I can't explain myself.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.520]   I can't be comments anymore.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:55.320]   I have to make a gesture.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:56.320]   So I don't know.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.320]   And I don't care.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.080]   I want to stop talking and then we're just going to do this the whole time.
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:02.880]   And that's how we're going to talk to each other.
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:07.840]   I had, I hadn't seen this emoji, this hands up emoji until I started using telegram.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.080]   And then it was one that's very common in the telegram gives you stickers that reflect
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:17.760]   emojis so you can add an extra something, something by having a sticker with that's
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.760]   like hands up.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:22.480]   I make my, I'm doing it or something, which makes I make mine brown and just do it as
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.480]   a hands up.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.480]   Don't shoot.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:25.480]   Yeah.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:26.480]   Well, that's what it was.
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:29.680]   You know, depending, look, Facebook's really does look like a don't shoot.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:34.160]   Emoji one, I don't know what emoji one is, but I really don't know what's going on
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:35.160]   there.
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.680]   It looks like drops of liquid are something going on there.
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.680]   That's weird.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:39.680]   That's weird.
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:42.840]   But the weirdest one is definitely Microsoft Windows 10.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.400]   What the hell is that?
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.040]   The guy going down a roller coaster.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.360]   Is that the blue man crew?
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:49.000]   Oh, that's what this is.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.840]   Well, see, that's the thing.
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:53.920]   It's depending on how you illustrate it could really be different things, can it?
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:58.000]   I think of it as a man like when people say, Oh, man, we're going to be the amen.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000]   Amen, brother.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.760]   That's what I feel like that is on everything.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:05.320]   Well, it is known as the Hallelujah emoji.
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.920]   So, okay, whatever you go.
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:11.600]   If you're ever if you're ever confused, though, you you can make the you can make the iPhone
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:13.520]   speak the emojis.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:18.480]   Oh, if you turn it on to like hearing impaired mode and then you send that or you just like
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.200]   highlight it and say, you know, you can make it actually speak it.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.800]   So it will say the iPhone will tell you what the names are.
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:30.040]   For example, the very popular poop emoji, the official name according to Apple is smiling
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:32.880]   pile of poo.
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.880]   I want to hear that in series voice.
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:37.480]   Yeah, or there's a British voice.
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:38.720]   That's the best.
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:41.200]   Really, you like the male voice?
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:42.200]   A smile?
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:43.200]   I like the British.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.200]   The British.
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:47.560]   Somebody said if you say Buffalo seven times something happens.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.640]   Isn't that the longest sentence that actually is English correct using one word?
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.640]   What?
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.280]   Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo.
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:56.200]   Is there seven different meanings of the word Buffalo?
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:57.560]   I think that sounds right.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:14:58.920]   Can you help us out?
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:01.080]   Someone explain this.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:02.560]   No, that is obscure.
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:04.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:05.560]   It's on Wikipedia.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.560]   I think well, it must be true.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.560]   Well, the internet's always active.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:08.560]   It knows that.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:09.560]   It's there's no means.
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:12.040]   I'm going to paste Buffalo in seven times.
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:15.600]   Five, six, seven and see what happens.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.600]   Yes.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.760]   Bison engaged in a contents contest of dominance.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.120]   That's what it means.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:24.880]   Because and the bison is a Buffalo.
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:26.880]   I don't know.
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:27.880]   Yeah.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:29.720]   It's a grammatically correct sentence.
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:33.120]   It's how example of homonyms and homophones.
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:35.560]   Teach this to your kids.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:40.560]   The city of Buffalo, the noun Buffalo, the verb Buffalo.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:42.160]   So you'd have to know what he is.
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.880]   It's a Buffalo from Buffalo.
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:44.880]   Buffalo Buffalo.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:45.880]   Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:46.880]   Can you shuffle off to Buffalo?
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:47.880]   Buffalo.
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:51.520]   I understand the word too much.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:52.800]   Who thought this up?
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:54.800]   He sat down and was like, I know, I got it, guys.
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:57.640]   We're going to use Buffalo and read a sentence with it.
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.920]   Because they must have had a lot of time on their hands to think this up.
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:02.800]   Like, who wrote this article?
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:06.080]   The Wikipedia page is longer than the Bible.
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.840]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:09.840]   I'm getting distracted.
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.920]   I'm going to show you something that's going on.
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:15.320]   This week in grammar.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:18.720]   It's all about the punctuation.
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:21.600]   Or the picture of.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:23.960]   All right.
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:27.880]   What happens is say, "beatle juice" three times.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:29.560]   I don't know.
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:32.640]   Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:34.840]   Or "Bloody Mary."
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.960]   What happens then?
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:40.600]   If you say "Bloody Mary" in the dark, she appears.
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.440]   She just say it once?
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:43.440]   No.
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:45.160]   No, you have to say it in the mirror three times.
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.560]   I think you guys know the urban legend, don't you?
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.560]   No, no, no.
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:49.560]   This is the revelation.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:50.560]   Okay, turn the lights down.
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:53.120]   Natalie Morris is going to tell us some ghost stories, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:54.440]   It's body wash white.
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:57.000]   The highlight of the show.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.760]   Go ahead, Natalie.
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.760]   Heck no!
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:04.520]   That was your moment to shine.
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:05.360]   I think she's--
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:09.080]   I hope you're alone in my alley.
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.640]   Most from my shoulder, I will pee my tears.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.760]   Natalie, behind you.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:17.400]   I think you're-- oh my god, it's in the house.
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.040]   It's coming from inside the house.
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:20.040]   That's so mean.
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:21.040]   I'm sorry.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:22.040]   We shouldn't say that.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:23.040]   The children are inside the house.
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:26.120]   Somebody in the chair says, if you say Donald Trump three times, he gets elected president.
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:27.840]   Oh gosh, no one's in it.
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:28.840]   So don't you--
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:31.360]   But don't you want to know what's going to happen now?
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.360]   Don't you-- no, no, I'm just--
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:36.800]   I can't imagine you guys zoomed in behind me like some of us here.
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:37.800]   We're creepy.
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:39.240]   We're creepy that way.
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:43.280]   My sister has never forgiven me for locking her in the bathroom and saying "Bloody Mary."
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:45.280]   She swears she saw something and then--
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:46.280]   Oh.
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:47.280]   Oh.
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:48.280]   It must be a real thing.
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:49.280]   Oh.
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:50.280]   I wonder.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.120]   I'm not even going to Google it.
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.120]   Actually--
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:55.000]   You're too scared.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.920]   Does it Clayton like really into ghosts?
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.720]   Or is it you two?
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:06.040]   No, it's really into the-- yeah, we're both in, you know, very into like--
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:08.000]   Does he believe-- do you believe in ghosts?
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:13.160]   So you think that actually "Bloody Mary" could show up?
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.760]   I don't really believe in nefarious ghosts anymore.
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.760]   Oh.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.960]   So only the Casper definitely goes to--
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:21.960]   No, I believe in the afterlife and sort of--
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.960]   Yeah, well, that's not--
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:23.960]   Like, right.
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:28.920]   But I don't believe that-- and I believe certain spirits sort of get stuck in certain places.
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:31.480]   But Clayton like goes ghost headings and stuff, right?
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:35.920]   He's actually going-- for some reason, Siri just turned on.
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:36.920]   I didn't--
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:37.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:38.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:39.920]   Do you have an answer?
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:43.080]   Yes, I'm here.
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:45.520]   He's going ghost hunting with the ghost hunters.
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:46.520]   Yeah.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.520]   Yeah.
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:48.520]   Somewhere--
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:52.800]   Do it be on TV or is he just going-- like going with him?
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:53.960]   No, it will be on TV.
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.160]   It'll be on Fox and Prince.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:55.840]   Oh, my God.
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:57.200]   "Bloody Mary" is hovering over your--
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.200]   don't look now over your right shoulder.
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:00.600]   It's "Bloody Mary."
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.200]   No, wait a minute.
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.440]   That's the good kind with celery.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:04.640]   I actually--
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.320]   these things, like, they really do sort of creep under my skin.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:08.840]   OK.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:09.360]   I'm sorry.
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:10.280]   We'll move on.
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:11.320]   You like that iPad?
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:13.600]   I find the iPad Pro awfully big.
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:17.160]   It is large, but I'm trying to use it as my primary computer.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.800]   So doing serious writing.
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.600]   It's good for great big spreadsheets.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:21.920]   Makes me long for my mini.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:25.680]   I have-- actually, if Burke or somebody
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:28.440]   would get my iPad Pro and the pencil and everything,
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:30.920]   I also got the Apple keyboard.
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:31.880]   And I got the Logitech.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.200]   I like the Logitech better, but it's so big and heavy.
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.720]   Yeah, it's a little bit cumbersome, just in terms of not
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:39.240]   other sides of the keyboard, but the whole package.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:40.360]   But the Apple keyboard's hard.
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.040]   It's a chiclet, so it's hard to take on.
[02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:42.560]   Doesn't move.
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:43.080]   Keys don't move.
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.520]   It looks really chiclet-y, but after years--
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:45.360]   I think it's a little.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.280]   It took me about two days until I was able to go
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.120]   at the same speed I was with anything else.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.360]   And your fingers aren't sore?
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:50.880]   No, not at all.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:51.400]   OK.
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:53.080]   And it's nice and thin.
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:54.880]   Is it going to be a hit?
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:57.320]   I think for certain type of people, including me, it is ideal.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.200]   And the big question is how many of those people are there?
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:02.720]   Most people are not going to buy it.
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:04.480]   Most people will not buy this handle laptop,
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:07.040]   because it's the price of a pretty nice laptop.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:07.300]   Yeah.
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:09.080]   When I think about what I paid for this thing.
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:10.960]   I think artists will go gaga for it.
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:12.120]   I mean, pencil is just right.
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:13.320]   That's what I think is going to happen.
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:14.400]   Pencil is just fantastic.
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:16.000]   If you like to draw and paint--
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.840]   This is much like you were saying, Phil, for the Apple Watch.
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:23.200]   If the apps appear that support this unique form factor--
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:24.960]   by the way, how does this work?
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:26.840]   You've got to--
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:29.720]   When you snap it on, you have to put it up, the iPad on,
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.440]   so it looks like it's upside down.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.040]   And then you go, like, yay.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:36.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:37.320]   This is great.
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:37.880]   No, no.
[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:38.880]   It's like--
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.600]   You have it on backwards, I think.
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:42.520]   Oh.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:45.200]   Johnny, I've just wrote it.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:46.520]   It just works.
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.600]   Yeah, it's had on, like, 170 bucks.
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:51.920]   And it's an accordion, basically.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:52.600]   All right, there.
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:53.160]   I got it.
[02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:54.800]   There we go.
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:57.680]   Really want to thank Jason Howell for making this possible.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:00.080]   Jason, you rock.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:02.360]   It's been a great year and a half with you.
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:06.080]   I look forward to seeing what you and Meghan do with TNT.
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:08.680]   Thanks for putting this best of together.
[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:12.520]   Thanks to all of you for your support through the years.
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:14.600]   Twit is now in--
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:16.520]   we have completed--
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:18.720]   this is hard to believe-- 10 years.
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:24.720]   We are in our 11th year for any show that is a landmark.
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:29.440]   But this show has continued to grow and grow in popularity.
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:30.400]   And it's all because of you.
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.400]   So thank you so much.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:34.720]   I hope you have a fantastic 2016.
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:36.760]   And know that we will be here right here with you
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:39.560]   every Sunday afternoon with This Week in Tech.
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:40.760]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:43.840]   I'll see you next week at Brand New Show on Leo Laporte.
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.480]   And another Twit.
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:46.480]   Say it with me.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:47.320]   Is it the camp?
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:49.120]   Bye-bye.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:55.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:57.760]   Alright, I'm doing the twin.
