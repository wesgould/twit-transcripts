[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.000]   Tech news of the weekend boy. There's a lot fortunately we have the experts online with us
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   starting with on my left Miriam Jwarae. Formally of NCAGIT now at Pebble. Congratulations.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.160]   Thank you. Thank you. Great. Are you an evangelist for Pebble?
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   Apparently I am. I don't know how that really happened but it did. And it's kind of like now
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.840]   I can pretend to be like Gag Kawasaki you know. Yeah. Thank you for something.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.080]   Well but what's cool about this is you still and I could tell you never lost your enthusiasm
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.240]   for this stuff because you still get all the new stuff and review it and talk about it.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.000]   You just do it. Well you know I think being a product person means understanding other products.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Right. So you need to kind of stay connected, understand what's good, what's not good and
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.880]   kind of like you know continue forming those opinions. So I've requested from everyone to
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.280]   you know obviously it's a hobby now but you know to keep me in mind and they've been very generous
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.880]   so far. Good. Well she's got something that I want but we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.600]   You've got something I want. But before we do let's say hi to Tim Stevens,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.520]   former colleague over in Gagit. Now it's seen him. Good to see you.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   Good to see you. This is interesting. I've been on podcasts with Miriam before but we never
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.360]   co-guested before. I don't think so. It should be interesting. No this is the first time.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.120]   It's true. You actually know each other. That's marvelous. I know. It's not just on TV.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.480]   Also with this from Paris, France. It's Patrick Bezia, not Patrick.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.680]   Good to see you once again, Patrick. Good to see you too. I have also been on a show with Miriam.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.160]   So it's kind of a family reunion. Oh you know it's this whole thing. It's very incestuous.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.880]   We all know each other and we all work together and that's part of the time.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.640]   You guys have no idea how incestuous it is. No don't get started. No don't start. No but
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   that's one of the joys about doing this and one of the joys about new media and podcasting in general
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   is it's such a non-competitive medium that everybody just kind of hangs out with everybody else.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.440]   It's mostly because there's no money in it. If there were money in it, then we'd get each other's
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.200]   throat. It's probably. But you know that that's really something I appreciate it. I'm sure the
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.360]   listeners as well about the world of podcasting when I fell into it a few years ago. It was so
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.840]   different from the world of blogging where it seems everyone was out to get everyone else.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.360]   That was something that really drew me into it. So I'm glad that it continues to the say with
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.960]   maybe a little bit more money hopefully for some people. But I bet blogging started out
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   kind of that way too. In fact, I seem to remember it was very collegial in the early days and
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.800]   you know, waxy links would hang out with, you know, it was just all relaxed. But then, you know,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   it becomes more professional and more money is involved and you get the big companies like
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.080]   and gadget and getting involved and suddenly everybody's, you know, trying to top everybody else.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.640]   I think that's just normal and I'm sure it's going to happen with podcasting.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.760]   If you can ever become successful. I'm still trying to get a Tim just kidding.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.960]   Hey, so you have an X is five, Miriam. I'm so jealous.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.800]   That's a lie. I saw it. It's a lie. Yeah, you're like that person taking a picture of the new
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.400]   KitKat bar coming into the Google campus. I don't know what that is.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.520]   There it is. It's an X is five. It's a black one. I wanted a white one, but you know what? I'm not
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.040]   going to complain because Google was really kind enough to send me one and I've been playing with
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.160]   it for about 48 hours and I'm very, very delighted. It's very, very great. I'm really
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000]   interested in talking about not just the hardware, but what's new in KitKat for four because
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.120]   apparently Google has kind of pulled a Facebook on their launcher, but we will get to that in a
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.560]   minute. I'm sure I've ordered my five. I should get it. They shipped it surprise. You know,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.200]   they said we'll ship November 5th or November 8th, but they shipped it almost immediately like
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   November 1st or 2nd. Although it's still not coming until Thursday. I bet I get it a little
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.000]   early. I don't know. I paid for the two day business shipping to business day shipping.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.160]   Sucker. Yeah, I think I was. I think I because then they're now UPS has it,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.880]   but they're just going to sit on it until November 8th. I'm just saying that because in the past,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.800]   when I'm ordered stuff from Google Play, it has made very little difference because I think
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.120]   since we're in California, you know, it's just probably sitting in a warehouse like in Oakland right
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:19.440]   now and we're all like, oh man, I want it. Is it all there? Well, we're going to talk about all
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.560]   that in a second, but before the show, we did a little Twitch special number 172 if you want
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.120]   to watch it because of course, the other thing that came out this week, same day iPad Air
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.640]   became available in stores November 1st and there were people lined up to get one. I was
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.560]   lucky enough, John Slanina from our office went down to the Apple store and picked me up an iPad
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.240]   Air and what we did, of course, as always, the folks at iFixit.com flew to Oceana. They went to
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.400]   Australia to be the first because that's where the day begins and did their first
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.880]   iFixit tear down right now at the iFixit headquarters in San Luis Obispo. Kyle
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.200]   Wiens is there with Miro who is tearing down an air. Hi, Kyle. Hi, Miro. Welcome back.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.960]   On iPad Air, tear that number two. So I see that you have now removed the batteries. That was
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.600]   the thing that was most concerning, right? Yeah, so we got the batteries out. We managed not to
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.560]   puncture them in the process. You can see we warped them a little bit, you don't know, but I can bend
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.440]   it back. Oh, they're soft and pliable. So tell me from the inside, what's different about this iPad?
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.320]   So this iPad has a lot more in common with the iPad many than it does with the iPad 4.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.400]   And so if I take a look at the inside, the process of getting components out,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.560]   you can see along here these are actually glue strips where the main board sat. So we just
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.160]   pulled this out. So we had the main board sitting like this. By the way, for those not watching
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.200]   video, the main board is a tiny fraction of the total space of an iPad. Yeah, if you're looking
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.400]   at the overall layout, it's almost all battery. Pulled it apart. Yeah, you have it about like that.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.680]   So that's that's most of the battery. That's about 80% battery, 20%
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.040]   circuitry. Yeah. And so if they want to make it smaller or thinner at this point, they have to
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.440]   reduce power consumption or reduce the battery. Well, they are doing that because isn't this
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.760]   a smaller battery than the last generation iPad? Right. This is it was a I think 44 watt
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.440]   hour battery before. And now this is a 33 watt hour battery. That's a big difference.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.640]   It's yeah, they were able to shrink the battery a lot and that's power efficiencies with the
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:35.280]   the a7 and I mean, more efficient graphics processor and a display that's more energy efficient. It's
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   kind of all across the board. They were able to reduce the energy consumption. One thing that you
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.200]   always do when you do these tear downs is you give the device a repairability score.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:52.960]   What is what kind of repairability is this device have? So the iPad aired does not do very well.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:00.640]   It is on par with the iPad mini also known as very, very, very difficult. So the first thing you
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.160]   have to do to get inside is remove the front glass. I've got the front glass and the display here
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.520]   and that the glass is glued into the main iPad. And so to get inside, you have to heat the glass up
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.080]   and and work guitar picks and all the way around, cut your way through the adhesive and then use
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.800]   a suction cup to lift the glass up. So it is possible to repair. We gave it a two out of 10.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   So that means yes, you can fix it, but be aware that it's going to be a process. Fortunately,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.720]   I fix it has the manual you can actually follow along. Although I think some experience really helps.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.440]   I know this is the first time Miro's done an air, but he's done iPads before. He's done iPads
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.680]   before. Yeah, I mean, this is the sort of thing. It's absolutely possible to get going starting your
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.920]   own iPad repair business. You get in, you care for the first few and then you should get the feel for
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.760]   it. If it's your iPad, the thing that inspires the most confidence is when the glasses are
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.080]   really broken before you get going. So you don't have to worry about breaking the glass.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:08.240]   So it's roughly been an hour that he's been taking it apart. Does it get quicker or is it an hour
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.200]   every time? It will get quicker. He's not using as much heat as we would use if we were going
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.640]   faster. So we wanted to show you the process. So what the big design difference with the air
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.680]   compared to the previous iPad is that there's just a lot more glue, which means more time getting
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.840]   it apart. And that's been a trend with iPads. Apple's gluing it more and more and more.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.440]   They're gluing it more and more because the glue is thinner. It's cheaper to assemble. They don't
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.360]   have to pay people to turn screwdrivers when they're assembling it. But it makes life very difficult
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.280]   when it comes to repair and recycling. Score two out of five, two out of 10. Two out of 10.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.040]   Two out of 10. In contrast with like the Nexus 7, which got the 7 or 8 out of 10.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.400]   Yeah, I've defried the back off by Nexus 7 with a fingernail. You don't need any spudgers or
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.800]   not need a tool or anything. You can just pop it right off. And I think replacing the battery,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.040]   the batteries are consumable. It's something that wears out after a year or two. Everyone
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.360]   should be able to replace the batteries and all of their devices. And I don't think that it's
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.280]   environmentally responsible to make a device with a battery that's harder to remove.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.360]   Well, that's the other side. It's not really a repairability issue. It's a recyclability issue
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.200]   because a recycler needs to take it apart in order to responsibly recycle it.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.520]   Right. And there's been discussion. The Environment Minister in Germany last year
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.600]   said that he thought they should ban sales of the iPad in Germany because of the non-removable
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.320]   battery. So there's a growing backlash in the international community about device designs like
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.880]   Is it to the worst you've ever seen? The worst tablet that we have ever seen is the Surface Pro 2.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   So we took that apart last week and it got a one out of ten.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.360]   Geez. Blue there as well. I'm sorry. What was that? Was it glue?
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.840]   It was glue and screws. I mean, so the unnecessary glue and screws. So where Apple's design,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.320]   we thoroughly understand why they did what they did with Microsoft was still scratching our head
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.360]   a little bit trying to figure out why they designed it. Pretty much says it all right there.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.280]   They did what? Why? So I have a question about this.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.640]   Go ahead.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   You I was watching the special earlier and it was very interesting and you were talking a lot
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:25.200]   about repairability and environmental friendliness. But I had a question that you didn't really answer
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:34.480]   straight up. Would they be able would Apple be able to make a device as thin and as compact
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.680]   if they were doing it more responsibly? If they had a few more screws, if they had the battery
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:48.000]   more easily upgradable, is that possible or not? I think that's a really good question. The only
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.160]   way to know for sure would be to set up a design team and try to do it. And if you could do it,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.440]   then it would be possible. So I can just speculate. I think they could come very close. I don't know
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.680]   if they could get quite as them. But I think we're talking about fractions and millimeters.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.800]   I think Apple cares about fractions and millimeters. So the original iPad was a bit thicker than the
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   iPad Air for sure. But I used to have these clips around the perimeter that held the front panel
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:21.920]   in place and made the opening procedure probably 10 times easier. The thing is those clips would
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   still fit within this perimeter. So I'm not, you know, like Kyle said, we can't really speculate
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.120]   because we're not designing these things. But just from the looks of it, I don't see a reason why
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.640]   they couldn't do the same thing with iPad Air. Yeah, Apple's design team starts with constraints.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.000]   They say the management, Tim Cook and Johnny say this is what the product is going to be. And
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   then the designers and engineers have to figure that out. And if a replaceable battery was a design
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.960]   constraint, I think Apple's engineers could create a phenomenally elegant tablet with a
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.600]   removable battery. Kyle Wienze, I fix it.com. Miro, thank you for joining us. It seems like you're
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.200]   an hour later, almost done. We're almost done. So we've got, I mean, I've got the most cables out.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.320]   Yeah. So this is almost empty. You can see we've got the SIM card left, which is glued down. So we
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.960]   got unglued ash and some of the buttons around. Now here's the question. Can you put that back
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.160]   together again? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. This'll go back together. This might be my new iPad.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.960]   Awesome. You're a brave man, Kyle. I fix it.com if you want to see the full
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.800]   tear down their philosophy, which I completely agree with is you own it. You ought to be able to
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.160]   fix it, repair it, play with it. But also even farther than that, you got to consider recyclability
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.240]   and reusability. These things are these things could go 10 years if you could replace the battery.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.200]   The solid state stuff's not going to fail. And I got to wonder about places like the LA school
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   district where they float a 30 year bond to buy every student an iPad that's going to last two years.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.680]   And they're going to be paying for 30 years from now. It doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.440]   You got to have a long term strategy with this technology. Two years. It's too short.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.200]   Here's a question for you, Kyle. This is Miriam. So is there, you know, Apple has a battery
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.400]   replacement program for like the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro Retina and the iPhone, correct?
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   There is no such thing for the iPad then. No, they do. They have a battery program. I believe
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.880]   it's $129. So the battery isn't covered on the warranty. Yeah, it's pricey. They won't do it
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.160]   on the warranty. They have $129 option. You have to give your device to them. You know,
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.720]   they take their time with it and get it back to you. Right. The interesting thing is that Apple
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.800]   doesn't replace very many batteries. And even the $129, you'd think there'd be a lot of people doing
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.200]   it. But I think their sales reps proactively try to talk people out of it. Why replace the
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:50.880]   battery when you could get the brand new iPad? Yeah, I did our value replacement once on a MacBook
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:57.680]   Air 11, my first generation 11 that my spouse is currently using. And we had always $99, but
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.760]   it's definitely cheaper than buying a new Mac. And he's perfect. It is for a Mac with $129 on a
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.960]   $499 product. That's the different equation. That's one quarter of the total cost. I mean,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.480]   it's three quarters of the insides as we just saw. So that's true. In terms of volume, it's a great
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.920]   deal. Thank you. Thank you, Kyle. Thank you, Mira. We really appreciate it. Thanks guys.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.080]   I fix it.com. You guys are great. Really, really love the work they do.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.320]   You're watching Twit with our great panel Miriam Jwahre Ted, Ted Stevens, Tim Stevens.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.960]   Who's Ted Stevens? About thinking of Ted Bundy. I'm former Alaska state governor. That's right.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.800]   Governor of all. That's right. Senator from Alaska. Who could ever forget Ted Stevens? I'm sorry, Tim.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:47.120]   He's the guy. He's the guy who said the Internet is full of tubes. Yes. A series of tubes. It's not a
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:56.560]   big truck. The series of two. Oh, never be forgotten. And of course, Patrick Beja,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.680]   not Patrick. It's great to have you. We're going to take a break when we come back. There is lots
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.760]   of news, including the good news that you can now take your device and keep it on gate to gate.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.880]   Thanks to the FAA. They said, you know what? All this time, it was no problem. But first,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.920]   a word from Citrix, the makers of the great GoToAssist product. If you're an IT, and I know a lot of
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:23.520]   you are, you do support for software, or even just family members, you might be the family IT guy,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.080]   or gal. You need to know about GoToAssist. It lets you take control of your IT world
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.240]   from a simple cloud-based tool set. It gives you a great set of the things you need the most.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.000]   Of course, everybody, I think, knows GoToAssist as the leader in remote support. They've been
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.720]   doing it for years. They really do the best. All the tools you need, unattended support,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.200]   up to eight sessions. At the same time, you can install and start to install on one and
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.080]   move to the next one, start another, install, move on, move on, move on. You get an assay of
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.520]   everything that's running on the system. But now they've got additional modules that I think
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.800]   are really, really useful. GoToAssist monitoring. We'll crawl your network, tell you all the hardware
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.960]   and software on it. You could set up a dashboard, completely configurable, with warnings, alerts
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.600]   for different problems that are coming up. You're running out of toner, or the bandwidths
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.080]   down, or the servers down. You can get an instant message, an email, a text message.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.280]   They also have the service desk now, which allows you to log incidents,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.560]   track the resolutions, keep track of changes, everything you need all at once. I love all three,
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.520]   and I want you to try all three free right now. Visit GoToAssist.com. Use the promo code TWIT.

[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.920]   I have not, because I'm on Verizon, and of course, that is the one cure that's going to be left out,
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.200]   sadly, about when I'm kind of regretting my position on Verizon. Verizon's got great coverage
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.560]   where I am, but man, I just seem to be lacking the phone lately. So no, I have not ordered an
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.120]   Nexus 5, but I am envious of those who did. There was some debate over whether Verizon had pissed
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.080]   off Google and that they had part of the company, but supposedly they're working together on
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.320]   something for next year. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it definitely seems like there must have been
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.960]   some hurt feelings after the Nexus 7 LTE debacle. Which still doesn't work, as Jess Jarvis.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.640]   Verizon is supposed to be an open network. The mandate is to be an open network by the FCC.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.160]   So in theory, they should be able to use the Nexus 7. There's no technical reason not.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:52.560]   They say we're still testing it. Yes, I say. Well, so as far as I know, the Nexus 7 works with any
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.640]   pretty pre-existing actors, right? Yes. But I've tested the Nexus 5 and there's nothing.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:05.200]   So what that means to me is now I'm in a 700 megahertz area and Verizon is rolling out AWS
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:12.400]   support. So I can't test in AWS, but I have a feeling that perhaps the Nexus 5 will work on AWS
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:19.120]   Verizon, but only data, right? Because the CDMA radio won't kick in unless they have the
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:26.960]   IMA/ESN in their database. So that's interesting. That's an on issue because you can't activate it
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.240]   because Verizon won't activate it, but you could at least use the data. So in some AWS markets,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.200]   this needs to be tested. That's the theory right now. Who pays for that? I mean, how can they bill you?
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.600]   Well, no, no, I mean, you have an active sim already. You have an account. So you do have an account.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.480]   So you have a sim card. It's from like an existing device that works and you put it in the Nexus 5
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.320]   and potentially it might work on AWS data only. And on the Nexus 7, it's the same thing. If you
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.120]   put it in, but it supports 700 megahertz LTE, so it just works. Apparently, I don't know how I'm
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:03.760]   tested it. So but but I can say that the Nexus 5 does work great on T-Mobile LTE on AT&T LTE.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.000]   And I haven't tested sprint, but reports are that, yes, it will work on sprint.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.680]   So this AWS LTE, this advanced wireless services, is this the next generation of LTE that will
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.560]   carry voice as well as data? Because I know this is not LTE advanced, which is a different thing
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.840]   altogether. So it's advanced wireless service, but it's not LTE advanced.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.880]   Right. So yeah, AWS is just a play like, you know, it means that you're using the 700 megahertz
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.920]   spectrum. You could be doing 3G HSPa+ on that, like T-Mobile does, right? So it's not necessarily
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:44.240]   an LTE thing. Vova LTE, which is voice server LTE is what we're all waiting for so that we
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.280]   can kind of break that dependency on CDMA for voice on sprint and Verizon.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.840]   And that's the plan for both carriers, right?
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.640]   I believe for sure for Verizon, I'm not sure for sprint at this point, but I mean, they
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.960]   eventually will have to come around and do it. You know, it's just like, it's just a big mess.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.440]   I think really Verizon is just being a bunch of, you know, sh** heads right now.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.080]   Sometimes...
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.040]   It's only how long you're taking this for.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.760]   You gotta call.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:17.760]   I mean, seriously, look, it's like, it's just ridiculous.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.400]   Like, they, like, this phone could work on Verizon and heartbeat.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.640]   They just refuse to go. They just don't want to do it because, and they're breaking the law.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   That's the thing that's crazy about this. Nobody's calling them on this.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.400]   Well, Jeff Jarvis has he filed a complaint with the FCC.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.160]   Yeah, but...
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.080]   Not a good, that's going to do. They were closed at the time.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.280]   So anyway, I think there's a feud between Google and Verizon.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.400]   You just accept it.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.280]   I'm not convinced that they're working on some Verizon device.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.520]   I think this was just Sundar's way of deflecting the question.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:58.320]   He said, "A set of projects for 2014 is in the works."
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.760]   I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.120]   And then you know it'll be crippled like the Galaxy Nexus for Verizon was.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.680]   Right.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.800]   And we'll all be bitchy about it.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.760]   It's a storage with no removable microSD card.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.440]   I will be very...
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.720]   Well, I don't care about that.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.080]   You know, I think SD cards are overrated because
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.640]   Android and most other operating systems don't really use it as.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.120]   It's not equal to the internal memory.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.520]   Some apps can be moved there.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.880]   Not if they use widgets.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.240]   You can store pictures there.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.400]   But if you're using burst mode, it's too slow.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.560]   So you have to save it to internal memory.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.160]   It's just not as...
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.400]   It's not like, oh good, you're extending the memory by 64 gigs.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.320]   Yeah, it's definitely the red-headed stepchild of storage on your phone, for sure.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.200]   But you can set up Spotify, for example, to cache to your SD card,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.840]   which is what I do.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.360]   And you can download your music there too,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.800]   which is again, what I do.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.560]   But you have for photography and for high access stuff,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.520]   you definitely need it internally.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520]   And I think it probably does slow your phone down.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.880]   If you have apps running up there,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.400]   or if you have a lot of stuff coming off of there.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.640]   But still, it's a nice option to have for that stuff
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.160]   that you don't need to access as often.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.200]   And it is frustrating.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.360]   It's been frustrating to see some devices be kind of gimped on Verizon.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.160]   You know, they'll have a removable storage on other carriers,
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.040]   or they'll even have things like the Note 2.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.440]   And on the Verizon version, they removed the widget to turn off Wi-Fi,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.240]   just because they want you on cellular data more often.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.320]   And you only see that on the Verizon version.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.640]   They removed the setting to turn off Wi-Fi.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.520]   You have to dig into the menu to turn on and off Wi-Fi.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.400]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.920]   It's the only cure that you have to do that on too.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.560]   If you go to get the AT&T note too, it's right there.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.200]   I pray, and this is why everybody buys the neck.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.840]   Well, not everybody.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.240]   But then this is the truth is we have to remember.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.520]   Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 are as popular as they are with our sets.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.880]   The Ethusia set are unknown to normal people.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.160]   But I got to say, the more we use this stuff,
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.080]   the more we want the pure Android experience unmodified
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.760]   by either carriers or manufacturers.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.520]   They just crap this stuff up.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.920]   They do?
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.280]   So tell us about the Nexus 5, Miriam.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:05.920]   You like it?
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.240]   Yep.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.640]   What do you like about it?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.240]   So camera, that's always been the weak spot on these things.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.880]   It's pretty awesome overall.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.040]   I mean, it has all the best of the best, really.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.680]   I mean, what you're looking at is a slightly diluted G2.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.000]   Right?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.120]   So you have--
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.280]   You love the G2, I remember.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.320]   I like the G2 a lot.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.360]   I think that it checks all the box in terms of specs,
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.400]   but the software is a hassle like most of these skin phones.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.840]   So this basically removes--
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.280]   you lose the skin in here, which is great.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.400]   And you get a slightly smaller screen, 5 inches of 5.2,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.280]   and 8 megapixel versus 13 megapixel shooter.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.040]   But you keep the OIS, the optical image civilization,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.280]   which I think is one of the most significant thing
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.960]   any phone should have today.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.360]   And to be noted, Samsung does not have yet
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.720]   on any other phones.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.600]   Interesting.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.400]   So the shooter is significantly better than Nexus 4.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.800]   It's still-- there's a lack of consistency
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.360]   in Android cameras and Android imaging software
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.200]   that is very, very frustrating.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.440]   If you pull out an iPhone 5C or 5S and you shoot a picture,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.360]   you're pretty much guaranteed to create a great shot
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.160]   every time within the limitations of the hardware.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.120]   Does no OIS on iPhones yet, but it still works really well.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.760]   You pull out an Android device and it's a crap shoot.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.640]   And with the Nexus 5, you still have that tremendously,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.680]   horrendously bad camera from Google, the default Android camera.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.120]   And it's a total mess.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.920]   And yes, they've added something called HDR+,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.080]   which works fantastically well.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:51.440]   But ultimately, you're looking at pretty poor experience.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.880]   And that's what I want to see.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.040]   Why is the iPhone so much better?
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.000]   Is it software?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.520]   Yeah, because Apple's just prioritized that.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.400]   They've just really put the effort into it.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.720]   What I'm saying, it's like that's their priority,
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.440]   is they want to make sure you get a great shot every time.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.600]   And I think somehow the Android cameras just--
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.880]   They're not good.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.440]   They just don't seem to care as much.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.080]   And I know that Google's--
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.000]   it's surprising to me that a company like Google
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.880]   that has Google+, and all this photography stuff,
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.360]   and Vic is a big photography guy.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.120]   And yet, the viewfinder on the Nexus 5 is still landscape,
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.320]   and but the pictures you take are still 4x3.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   So you can never frame a shot properly.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.240]   Like, to this day, they still have that bug in there.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:40.880]   I'll show you.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.720]   So you're saying--
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.560]   The picture is 16.9, but the viewfinder is 4x3.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.320]   It's the other way around.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   The viewfinder is 16.9.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.480]   Because the screen is 16.9, but the picture you get is a crop on that.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.800]   Right.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.560]   So if I take a shot now, you know, of myself--
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.600]   Um, as you can see, my chin's at the bottom, right?
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.480]   Yeah, well, I went--
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.440]   If I--
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:07.840]   If I take a shot--
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.040]   The chin's at the bottom, your hair's at the top.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.880]   Your eyes are blue.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.400]   All right, you take a little button.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.280]   Your lips are orange.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:13.760]   I forget it.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.720]   Where's your blindfolded neck?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.120]   You'll get another inch on your chin.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.800]   Haven't you ever taken a selfie?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.560]   No, but the point is, is you'll get another inch
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.000]   on the bottom and top of my head.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.320]   Right.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.360]   And so you can never--
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.560]   You can never see what you're going to get.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.120]   And it's like, how can we not fix that?
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.920]   I guess--
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.200]   What you're saying is that the software,
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.360]   the camera app is bad, but the hardware is capable,
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.840]   or-- and you can get a better camera app,
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.480]   or is the hardware not up to snuff?
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.080]   Oh, the hardware is fantastic.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.960]   The camera hardware in the Nexus 5
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.520]   makes the iPhone camera hardware look like a joke.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:51.840]   Wow.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.800]   And so the bottom line is, it's all a software issue.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.520]   The software does not even remotely live up to what Apple's doing.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.800]   Is there a reason there aren't third party camera apps that fix this?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.400]   Because there's no low level access to the imaging processor.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.320]   And so the camera apps that you get,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.600]   some of them are very good.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.680]   I'm very happy with Capture Pro, which I'm using.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:15.840]   But they're limited because they can only access the APIs
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.880]   that Android exposes.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.960]   So they can change things like white balance and basic settings,
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.520]   but they cannot, for example, turn on HDR+.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.240]   Because that's a baked in feature of the image processor
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.280]   for the Nexus 5.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.240]   So yeah.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.040]   Now, the other thing I want to talk about is the new launcher,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.000]   the home launcher.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.840]   Because I haven't played with it yet.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.640]   Some have said that Google's taking a page from Facebook
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.880]   and made Google+ front and center.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.760]   In fact, it sounds like everything is a Google search.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.520]   You slide-- again, this is from what I've read.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.280]   You slide left and you've got Google now, right?
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:53.840]   That's your left--
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.160]   So if you go--
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.360]   I guess you slide right.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.520]   If you go that way, you can Google it now.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.400]   There's Google now.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:00.880]   Google now.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.040]   And then you go back and you get to the launcher
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.360]   and then you get out of the screen if you want.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.520]   Now, you could always replace it with the third party launcher.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.120]   I always put 8 pecs on anyway.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.160]   Yeah. And of course, you can still go up from the home button,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.920]   like this, to get Google now.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.880]   But it's interesting.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.920]   It's streamlined.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.840]   There's a lot of little things, actually.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.400]   Honestly, it's not very jarring to changes,
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.000]   but there's a lot of little subtle things.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.200]   There's a really awesome photo editor now inside the gallery app.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.040]   There's two gallery apps, which is really weird.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.200]   There's the old one, which has the new awesome photo editor in it.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.840]   And there's a new one, which doesn't have the new awesome photo editor.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.320]   Like what?
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.720]   Welcome to Google's universe of madness.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.120]   What else is there?
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.560]   I don't know.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.120]   It's just not very-- it's just all a lot of stuff.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.600]   We'll have a more detailed review in next weekend.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.520]   Oh, Google-- okay, Google now thing.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:54.640]   You know--
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.920]   It's just okay, Google now.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   I mean, it's just okay, Google comma now.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.480]   Okay now, Google.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.040]   So you can actually say, you know, okay, Google now.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.280]   But it ignores the now.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.560]   Oh, shoot, my phone's responding.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.080]   I got a Moto X here.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.320]   Oh, that's hilarious.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.000]   Every time I say that, it gets excited.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.520]   It's like a dog.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.280]   It's like, oh, you're home, master.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.080]   What can I do for you?
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.760]   So now you say, what do you say?
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.880]   Okay, Google?
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.520]   Okay, Google.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.960]   Yeah, not Google.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.760]   And it's very similar to the Moto X in that sense?
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.640]   Yeah, but it doesn't do it when it's asleep.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.800]   So you actually have to have the screen up to do it.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.520]   Yeah, that's kind of like other phones.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.840]   The whole idea of the Motorola phones--
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.680]   the droids-- some of the new droids do this too,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.320]   is that all the time it's always listening, even asleep.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.280]   So, you know, in that sense, it's kind of cool.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.600]   Let me actually just show you.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.360]   I just turned off Wi-Fi.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.200]   I think okay, Google now is too many words.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   I think even okay, Google's too many words.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   I should be able to just say something.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.800]   I should be able to make it be anything I want.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.320]   Hey, phone.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.240]   It's funny because it shows you in the search bar normally,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.040]   when you can say it.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.520]   But right now it's not showing it to me at all,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.400]   which is weird.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:08.800]   Well, it's not--
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.320]   I'm wondering if it's connectivity bound.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.240]   Like, I just had really bad Wi-Fi,
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.680]   so it doesn't show it to me.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.560]   Well, okay, moving on.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.440]   That's going to be--
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.240]   that's available.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.600]   Actually, they sold out right away.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.360]   Another wonderful thing about buying Nexus phones.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.720]   They're not--
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.000]   I guess you can get the 32.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.520]   Let me just check to see.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.720]   It's changing all the time.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.120]   Two to three weeks for the 32 in white.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.160]   Two to three weeks for the 32 in black.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.720]   The 16 gig, three to four weeks in white and black.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.600]   So if you didn't get it right away,
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.640]   you'll get it in a few weeks.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.080]   But it's--
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.920]   The real point of all of this is the price is very low.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.800]   300-- what is it?
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.080]   $350 for 16 gigs, 400 bucks for 32 gigs.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.240]   Don't buy it at Best Buy.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.000]   Apparently, Best Buy is charging $799 for it.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.920]   They reduced it now.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.400]   Wow.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.040]   I think they went down to 450.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   Scalp.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.600]   Yeah, they were--
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.400]   That's scalping.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.200]   Wow.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.080]   It's pretty outrageous.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.640]   But it's--
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.200]   That is kind of amazing.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.600]   The price on the Play Store is still basically--
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.280]   Oh, my video is really crappy.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.920]   Sorry about that.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.720]   That's all right.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.960]   The phone on the Play Store is still basically unbeatable
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.200]   from a price point of view, right?
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.760]   It's the best phone you can get for that price range by far.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.600]   It's like half what other comparable high-end phones would be.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.040]   Is it high-end or is it mid-range?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.240]   I can never get it away.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.360]   No, it's high-end.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.160]   It's high.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.480]   People are spec--
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.080]   not spec nazis.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.640]   Every--
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.160]   The Moto X came out and everybody--
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.600]   I don't like it because it's medium-range specs.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.040]   But that's not it.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.840]   That's not your main.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.280]   Look at the phone and see if you like it.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.440]   Who cares what the price is?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.480]   I tell you where they've cut corners is.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.600]   You know, the materials are like--
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.520]   It's all plastic with glass in the front.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.160]   And it's a tough touch, silky plastic.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.640]   It feels nice, but it's definitely on the cheap side.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.120]   And that's OK because with 350, you know what?
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:19.600]   Whatever.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   Also, slightly smaller display and slightly less megapixels
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.400]   on the camera probably saves them some money compared to the G2.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.760]   They took those stupid buttons off the back.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   Yeah, they did.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.000]   Although that really never bothered me,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   but I can understand how some people don't like it.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.320]   So it's really weird.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.960]   Yesterday and the day before,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.560]   in my little Google search bar here,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.720]   it would say what I could say,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.320]   which was like, OK, Google.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.120]   And now it doesn't say that.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.600]   You broke it.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.120]   And I've just rebooted it.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.800]   And I have no idea why that's happening.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.760]   You broke it.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.640]   It's very odd.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.000]   It was the selfie.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.240]   It probably was.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.080]   It's always the selfie.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.760]   I was listening to you.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.400]   It heard you say bad things about this camera.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.280]   Now it's--
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   I don't think--
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.400]   I agree.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.440]   It's got its arms crossed and it's in the corner shaking the sand.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.160]   Exactly.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.760]   In other Google news,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.200]   Channel 5 in San Francisco believes it knows what that barge is.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.440]   People have thought that Google is building a barge data center,
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.720]   a two-story data center.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.120]   Channel 5 says we know because we've talked to multiple sources.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.480]   It's a party boat.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   Google is going to build a party boat with a glass--
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.640]   Google Glass showroom in it.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.760]   The top deck is a party deck, according to KPIX.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.040]   The fourth floor is below it.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.360]   I don't--
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:57.280]   This seems even nuttier than the Google network, whatever center.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.560]   It seems very unlikely to me as well.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   I mean, if you're going to have a party for A-listers,
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.640]   just like, "Hey, guys, let's go down to the docks."
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.240]   And yeah, I'm a party.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.080]   I mean, if there was a heliport on the roof,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.960]   maybe they could land their helicopters there or something.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.240]   But I don't think that's part of the design.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.320]   They say they're part also at Fort Mason,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.080]   which is a nice area.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.320]   You could go to Fort Mason Center and get on the barge.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   Let's go show.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.760]   Sail around the bay.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.240]   If you've picked up Google Glass,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.120]   a big part of the buying experience is they take you to the window
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.800]   where there's all this magnificent view,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.840]   and then you take a picture.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.760]   And unless they're going to take you up to the roof,
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.880]   I don't think that's going to work there either,
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.400]   because there aren't any windows on the barge,
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.360]   which means you're going to be--
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.800]   because there are showrooms down below.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.200]   You're in a windowless room to check on Glass.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.040]   And you've got, "Okay, guys, let's all go up the elevator
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.640]   to try out your new Glass."
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.720]   I don't know. I don't buy that myself.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.920]   I think the floating server room makes more sense to me.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.520]   The project is reportedly, again, channel five, reportedly--
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.880]   I think it's a time machine.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.320]   It could be anything.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.640]   The project has reportedly been in planning for over a year now.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.440]   The over site of--
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.720]   How about it?
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.280]   It's a teleporter, because there's one in me.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.120]   That's right. They're building another one.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.480]   Searching just ones we're able to get from one side of the US
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.760]   to the other, really fast.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.040]   It's all under Sergey's, you know, Aegis.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.760]   The plan is to, quote, "upstage Apple's retail stores
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   with dazzling and unusual showrooms."
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.040]   It's said that access to Bryn's party deck
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.800]   will be on an invitation-only basis.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   We better get invited to that.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.080]   Kitted out with bars, lennies, and other opulent comforts.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.440]   The project is the way, because the Coast Guard is--
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.720]   It's a floating vessel, and we better look at it.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.040]   But it's made of shipping containers.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   This is when it has weird--
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.280]   It's just weird.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.800]   It seems like someone's pet project,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.840]   someone high enough up at Google
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.240]   that they had this weird idea,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.720]   and no one dared to say, "You know what?
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.920]   It doesn't really make sense."
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.960]   But so they had to do it, because it was the boss.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.600]   It's Elrond Hubbard, weird.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.080]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.160]   I mean, upstage Apple, Apple's stores, their strength,
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.320]   is not that they're dazzling and high-end--
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.520]   Well, of course, they're high-end,
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.480]   but they're retail experiences that make you feel comfortable.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.200]   They're not a barge somewhere with like,
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.160]   dazzles and stuff.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.720]   Containers?
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.040]   It's--
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.880]   The one thing that I thought was interesting was the fact that
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   they're supposed to be making
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.560]   Google Glass demo rooms,
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.080]   and maybe they're getting ready to extend the audience.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.360]   But well, the install base for Google Glass a little bit,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.560]   so they want to have a proper place to show it off.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.480]   But as you were saying, Tim,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.520]   this doesn't seem like the proper place to show it off.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.440]   And also, why a barge?
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.080]   Why is it cheaper than to rent a building on land?
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.360]   It's the weird experience of going on the sea.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   Is that going to suddenly make people think,
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.920]   "Yes, the Google Glass is cooler than I thought?
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.120]   It's weird."
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.360]   Feld figured out in the chatroom he's building an arc.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.080]   Well, it's--
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.840]   And all the Nexus devices went two by two.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.760]   I don't think it's a sales room.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.280]   I don't think it's a party barge.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.880]   I think it's just some weird Google thing,
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.520]   like Time Machine or like, you know, teleporter,
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.400]   or something crazy.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.160]   Like they're crazy, you know?
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.360]   And network operations center made sense to me,
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.000]   that they have data centers that were floating.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.520]   You could use-- they have a patent for this.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.720]   They got seawater cooling.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.280]   They have electrical generation from the waves.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.240]   That all made sense.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.360]   Google needs-- I mean, can you only imagine the demand
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   that companies like Google and Facebook have
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.800]   for more data centers?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   That made sense.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.680]   A party boat made out of shipping containers.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.440]   It doesn't sound appealing at all.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.640]   As you point out, no windows is kind of a negative.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.240]   So there are four barges, right?
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:54.960]   You know that.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.160]   There's four of them?
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.440]   Yeah, there's four.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:57.920]   Where else?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.160]   Well, we don't know.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.520]   There's many.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.200]   The two of them are rated for passengers, for people.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.160]   The other two are like freight.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.880]   Where are they?
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.440]   We don't know.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.200]   How do you know that's the tour?
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.720]   Because the company--
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.280]   It's kidding.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.840]   The company that they registered to has two more barges.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   And they're all-- they're all kind of in binary.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.320]   So 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.10.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.720]   Oh, no.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.760]   0.0.0.0.0.11.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.160]   Oh, no.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.440]   And 0.1.0.0.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:23.520]   Oh, no.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.400]   On the four barges.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.360]   Oh, no.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.800]   That's Google.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.440]   Google it.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.720]   That's Google.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.360]   Bravo.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.720]   That's definitely Google.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.480]   And so they're up to something.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.200]   The fact that there's four and one of two of our passengers,
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.400]   I'm telling you, this is the beginning of the Borg Collective.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.480]   This is how it all started.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.680]   I've been thinking I'll combine it and form a giant robot.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.880]   And then they just kind of stop.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.440]   Like Google.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.160]   Google's spaceship or the Apple spaceship takes off.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.760]   And they get this massive battle.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.720]   Oh, it's such amazing.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.920]   The Voltron Google.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.160]   It's nothing else.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.800]   Nothing else.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.000]   They've had the entire Silicon Valley and tech world talking about it for like two weeks.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.600]   So if they engineered this somehow to create a kind of buzz and then reveal something new,
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.920]   it is brilliantly executed.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.280]   So maybe that's it in the end.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.840]   Somebody said this is how you know a company has reached its peak
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.200]   and is now beginning its decline is when they build a massive new multi-billion dollar
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.720]   campus Amazon and Apple.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.200]   They start spending a lot of money because they're at their peak.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.520]   But almost inevitably, especially in the tech industry,
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.520]   when a company hits its peak, what's next?
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.400]   Not another peak.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.360]   I don't know.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.960]   I mean, all of the, well, these two companies you're talking about
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.080]   are doing very well.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.160]   And I don't see them, you know, maybe Apple it's debatable.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.880]   I would argue against the fact that they're losing their magic touch.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.640]   But Amazon is nowhere.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.600]   There's no one who's killing a big downtown Seattle headquarters is like crazy, right?
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.080]   Yeah, sure.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:04.640]   But I mean, there's no indication that Amazon has is doing anything other than keeping going up.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:11.600]   You know, they're not stopping anything that was spectacular.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.440]   And now they've lost their touch on anything.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.920]   They keep going steadily doing interesting new things.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.840]   Or even if they're not new iteration.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   Look at this. This is as crazy as the barge.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.480]   This is a biosphere that Amazon wants to build in downtown Seattle.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.560]   Hey, why not?
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.360]   Why not?
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.080]   I got money.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.720]   I'm all for these crazy projects, because they have so much money they can do it.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.400]   Who else is going to be the mad scientist?
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:38.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.480]   And the, I want them to have an underground layer.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:42.880]   Come on.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.320]   Okay, you're right.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.120]   To do a volcano.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.440]   Okay.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.040]   You're right.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.760]   Google near smartwatch launch.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.320]   According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is talking with Asian suppliers about mass
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.760]   production on a watch late stage development.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.360]   Sounds like they're going to beat Apple to the market.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.000]   And that's worked out well for Samsung.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.080]   So, so you saw was a device that wasn't thought through.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.360]   Well, at least it felt like a device that was hot.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.160]   Hot.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:12.480]   Sorry.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.840]   Our our watches.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.440]   Watches are hot right now.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.160]   Let's do one.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.880]   What can you do?
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.840]   Let's just, you know what?
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.440]   Just put something together.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.080]   It doesn't feel like Google would do something like that.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.160]   Everyone's been talking about Google now, which would be a perfect candidate for watch.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.560]   It seems like that would make sense.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.480]   Either way, I don't think Google is just going to throw something together just for the hell of it.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:39.680]   So I would be more interested in seeing what Google has to say than what Samsung had to say.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.800]   And Microsoft, of course, is making Google Glass eyewear.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.240]   Google Glass like eyewear.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.320]   Everybody wants to be in this wearable business, but nobody's kind of licked it.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.000]   You know, you have a unique perspective, Mary.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.040]   I'm moving over towards to Pebble now, which is another one of the pioneer wearable watches.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.760]   So I think, you know, I welcome, I mean, I'm happy to see some competition,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.600]   but I think they're kind of doing it wrong in the sense that they're forgetting what a watch is
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.720]   all about, which is simplicity and design and colors and materials and choices.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.360]   And, you know, people easily spend $200 on a watch that just tells the time and has maybe an alarm
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.160]   and a stopwatch.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.960]   But, you know, so, you know, to remain competitive, you have to be affordable,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.440]   but you also have to remember it's going to be a watch.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.560]   Right.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.480]   But they're all but ugly with all due respect, even the Pebble is not attractive.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.440]   I mean, this, I, I, this depends on the people you talk to, right?
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:40.240]   I mean, I think personally, I would love to have more variety and choices for Pebble and colors and
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.760]   in shapes. But I think that it's not, you know, it's not, we're not there yet.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.560]   I think that, you know, if you look at the variety of watches out there, like, you know,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:56.000]   we need to be able to bring that to fruition and yet make it a connected device that, you know,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.800]   enhances your phone experience.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.040]   Right.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:05.680]   What Pebble did very well, I think, you know, hold on a second, go ahead, Patrick.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.160]   Oh, I was just going to say what Pebble did really well and which is very important
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.760]   in the, in this market is that Pebble knew what it was from the beginning or what it wanted to be.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:22.000]   And I think that's going to be really key because these watches, by sheer reason of form factor,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.600]   can't be everything. They can't be a mini phone. So you have to choose your battles and execute
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.840]   really, really well on them. And Pebble did that. It, it chose something that was simple,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.200]   that it knew it could execute on and, and it works for the people who want that.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.240]   And I think that's exactly the point is that we're trying not to have a phone on your wrist.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.040]   We're trying to be a window into your phone that brings you tiny little moments of awesome,
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.160]   tiny, you know, tiny experiences, basically that are delightful. And that's really what it's about.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.560]   And if you look at the specs on our watches, you know, compared to like a gear or even
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.720]   what, and what Google and Apple are working on, I mean, we're not even trying to be in the same
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.120]   way because we don't believe that's where you want to be. Where you want to be is power efficient,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.720]   you know, one week battery life, you want to be waterproof because everybody forgets to take
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.280]   their watch off when they go in the shower and, you know, and swimming and that brings up the
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:18.400]   whole ecosystem of apps around, you know, playing in, in the water. And then there is, you know,
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.080]   the other thing is cross platform is a huge deal. You have to support more than, you know, one device
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:29.360]   or two devices, you know, isn't that the failing of the gear as much as aesthetics is it only works
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:37.920]   with the Note 3? Well, the gear has a laundry. Yeah, the gear works with like three devices.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.440]   They're they're very, you know, I have to say, I was a pebble contributor. I have a pebble. I
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.400]   wore the gear for a week. I've tried a lot of these devices. None of them stay on my wrist for
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:55.120]   very long. I like real watches. I love watches. But the real watches are used. The real watches
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:02.880]   have a real, their jewelry. Right. So there's something about it. But I think it's a really
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:11.440]   exciting area right now because we're sort of at this stage where we know what can be done currently
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:18.160]   kind of like before the iPhone arrived or before the iPad arrived. Smartphones, smartphones existed,
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.920]   but not quite the cool, the thing that really worked that clicked. And this is the same thing
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:30.960]   with the tablets. So I don't know if Apple is going to crack that crack the watch thing. Maybe Google
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:37.840]   will, but it feels like whatever will work, if it does happen is going to be something slightly
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:44.240]   different in a way that we can't really think of now. So it's really difficult to try and imagine
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.480]   what it's going to be because it's probably going to be something that we're thinking in the
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:54.240]   within the frame of what we know today for these devices. And that's probably not what's going to
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.960]   be very successful to the extent that those companies want those products to be. We're going
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.560]   to take break when we come back more with our guest Miriam Jwahre from Pebble Watch. Nice to see you.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:14.320]   It's get Pebble.com, right? Are you thinking? Are you sure? Are you frozen? It's get Pebble.com.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:21.360]   Can she hear me? I think she's frozen. Sorry, I, yes, get my, my wife's life. My, my wife's life is,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:27.040]   I have no idea what's going on with it right now, but it's like every few minutes or so, it dies.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.120]   You look great though. I mean, you're, you know, the quality of the video is fabulous. Your audio is
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.920]   great. It's weird that it's not scaling down when it's kind of failing because I mean, I can't
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.200]   hear you guys and you can't hear me. Yes. So it's pebbles@getpebble.com. You can order our watch there,
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.400]   and we deliver worldwide. And of course, there's Best Buy stores in Canada and the US and
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.080]   AT&T stores. But they're selling them for $800 at the Best Buy store. So no, I'm kidding.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:58.240]   Off contract, Leo. I'm just kidding. Tim Stevens is here. Tim, you're, are you,
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.680]   now I know you're at CNET. What are you, what are you doing at CNET?
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:07.600]   I'm doing feature work at CNET primarily. I did just do the iPad Air review, but that's a bit of
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.680]   an unusual thing for me. I'm primarily focused on, on feature stuff. So I did a big feature on a
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:17.120]   future farm in Japan. And I did an unveiling of the Surface Pro and that was announced.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.160]   I've got some stuff coming up on the automotive front in the near future. And I'm going to be
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.600]   launching a new column soon too. Awesome. I know you're big automotive buff. I am indeed. So it'd be
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.800]   nice to see you doing some of that. That's great. Well, in fact, let's get your review of the iPad
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:38.000]   Air next also with us from France, Patrick Bezia, not Patrick. So what's the latest with,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.520]   you don't do the Philius Club anymore, right? No, I stopped. Unfortunately, some things had to go.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:52.880]   I guess the latest is a show called Positron, which is basically something a show against boredom.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:59.600]   If you're bored, listen to the show and will recommend things that you can get digitally,
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.440]   that are fun and cool and awesome. Is it an English or French?
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:08.880]   Oh, it's in French. Unfortunately, I'm sorry. But you can practice your French people. So it's a
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:14.480]   great way to practice your French. That's positive right there. Actually, the best way to practice
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.120]   your French is probably to listen to Le Honde voutet, which is about tech. So you already know how
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.960]   the half the words were told. Our English. You know what I've been using, which is awesome,
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:32.160]   is this thing Duolingo, Duolingo, which is a website and an app from Carnegie Mellon.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.320]   And it's kind of got an interesting business model. It's very nice. It's kind of gamified
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:45.040]   learning, but it's free because what they're doing is they're offering translations
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:51.440]   via crowdsource translations via Duolingo. So I think who's buying those? Somebody,
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.120]   one of the tech blogs is buying these translations. I think it's very interesting.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.920]   Yeah, I've heard so many good things. I just wish I had more time to play with it.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.000]   I know. Well, it'll annoy the hell out of you if you start it up. And then it says,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.560]   come on, you come on. Yeah, I'm practiced. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:10.400]   I don't need so much. So how does it work? It encourages you, it sends you phrases to translate
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.680]   as you're learning the language. So wouldn't they be poorly translated? No, no, no, no, no. I
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.560]   don't know how the crowdsourcing works. Let me just, I have a Duolingo account. Let me just quickly.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:25.920]   I'm learning Spanish, right? So it has a whole skill tree as you're doing it. You work through,
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:32.960]   it's really quite well done. The lessons, it makes it easy. So correct, select the correct
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.920]   image, the apple. Well, that's easy. There's a picture of an apple. So I'm learning it's La
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:43.600]   Manzana. And then it says, okay. And it gives you nice little sense. And now I'm going to say,
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:53.040]   oh, now I have to translate this English to text, the man eats an apple. And it really works you along,
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.320]   you know, in a very fun way, you learn about conjugations and you work hard or not.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.440]   And I think once you, this is the web version, there's actually very nice app versions. And I
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:08.720]   think once you get good at it, that's when the crowdsourcing comes in. I'm not sure. They certainly
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:14.080]   wouldn't want me to translate Spanish at this point. Unless it says it's something about eating apples.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:20.480]   I'm really good at that. I'm very good at that. It's apple season here in New York too. So good.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:26.640]   Oh, I love them apples. We used to go out and we'd go up and we'd go pick your own apples up
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.680]   there and up New York State. And then, yeah, as an orchard right down the road from the
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.360]   island. My neighbors actually got an orchard and yeah, it's a good time for that. Lots of
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.120]   apples that are doing are being consumed as well. The cider is so good.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.160]   And then what language are you going to learn, Tim?
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:46.080]   I would love to learn Japanese, but that's not an option in there. Just yet. Plus, I don't know
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:51.120]   that I have the time or commitment to learn Japanese. I've heard it's an amazing undertaking.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.400]   But if Japanese pops in there, I might give a shot. It's right now. It's the romance language
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.520]   is French Portuguese. Well, German is not a romantic language. German just what's what's
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:06.400]   animated. That's how I did it. Did you speak Japanese from animal? Yeah, I actually lived in
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:11.520]   Japan for a few years. And I learned at university. I'm kidding. I didn't learn.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:23.280]   I went to university because I loved manga and anime so much originally. And then I fell in love
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:31.360]   with the country. You really are a nerd. I absolutely am. Yes. You combine. I am unapologetically nerdy.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.840]   I showed today brought to you by my friends at stamps.com. Why go to the post office? You can print your
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:43.520]   own stamps, your own postage from stamps.com using your computer. Your printer, you don't need any
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:47.920]   special links. You don't need a postage meter. You just need a stamps.com account. You even get
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:54.000]   discounts. You can't get it the post office. Post office loves stamps.com. They give you
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.560]   significant discounts on a lot of different classes of mail. Stamps.com, of course, always
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.160]   has the right postage. They know even when the postage goes up, you don't have to buy new stamps.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.880]   They know that you'll even get this great USB postal scale with your new account,
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.960]   which means you'll always know exactly the right postage no matter what you're sending. It'll print
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.440]   right on an envelope if you send out bills or informative mailers or that kind of thing. Even
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.920]   with your company logo automatically prints the return address, takes the mailing address
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:26.320]   from QuickBooks, your address book. If you sell on Amazon or eBay or Etsy or use PayPal, they'll
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.440]   interface directly with those too. They'll even fill out the international forms. We asked some
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.800]   of our listeners who use stamps.com because the ads tell us how they use it. One of them was Colin
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.560]   Heller. He's the co-founder and VP of Operations at Simple Bills Corporation. What they didn't tell
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.320]   me is what Simple Bills does. We could guess. It's maybe billing made simple. I don't know.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:54.880]   But one of the things that they end up doing is sending out a lot of mailings. He says,
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:00.640]   "We used to carry our mail to the post office and wait in line. I don't know why they would do that."
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.120]   Oh, that's neat. They take all the bills and they put them together. If you've got roommates,
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:11.440]   they divide it up. Clever. Clever business. Now he uses stamps.com. He says he could purchase
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.760]   posters that at discount, print labels. The company can apply directly to the packaging.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:20.960]   He really likes stamps.com. I want you to try it. Now, this is how Bill got started. I'm sorry,
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.920]   Colin got started. He went to stamps.com. You might be tempted by that $80 offer. But don't do it.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:33.120]   Click the microphone at the top of the page. Enter in our offer code TWIT. That $80 bonus value
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:38.800]   turns into a $110 bonus value. $55 in free postage. You can use over the first few months of your
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.920]   account. You get that scale. You only pay shipping and handling on that. But to make up for it,
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.040]   a $5 supply hit. Of course, four weeks free of stamps.com. I want you to try it right now.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.240]   Stamps.com, before you do anything else, click that microphone at the top there.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.680]   Use our offer code TWIT and you will just say goodbye to the post office forever.

[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.680]   Real quickly, let's check in with Tom Merritt. See what's coming up on the week ahead, Tom.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.960]   Hey, thanks. Here's some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.120]   today. Of course, the YouTube Music Awards today and the end of Daylight Saving Time.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.520]   Monday, November 4th, the Defrag Conference in Broomfield, Colorado kicks off.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.960]   Tuesday, November 5th, Gigah Oames Roadmap Conference kicks off in San Francisco and AOL
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.360]   reports their earnings. Wednesday, November 6th, the Tech Policy Summit happens in Napa,
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.720]   California right there in Twitsback Yard. AdTech, New York is kicking off that day as well and fast
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:38.080]   company innovation uncensored. Thursday, November 7th, Groupon reports their earnings and Friday,
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:44.080]   November 8th, the iPhone 5S and 5C are coming to boost mobile. Let's look at the week ahead.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:50.240]   Back to you, Leah. What a week, Tom Merritt, Monday through Friday, TNT Tech News today,
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:57:00.800]   10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time. We are now on standard time. So UTC has changed. It is 1800 UTC
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:07.200]   every Monday through Friday. Are you watching? Are you guys watching the YouTube Awards? Are we?
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.800]   No. No. No. I forgot all about it. Remember that was so horrible. What was it?
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:20.320]   Few years ago, it was just such a nightmare. The one with Katy Perry. That's right.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:26.880]   So they got Lady Gaga, Eminem, Arcade Fire. This is much more serious than it was.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:34.320]   Now they're getting serious. Now they're getting serious. I know what it is. I know what it is.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.000]   Leo, the barges, YouTube, it's the YouTube Awards.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.720]   Well, they got an ad right up front. 28 second ad right up front.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.760]   Wow. Yeah. We don't have to show the ad. That's okay, Brian.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   It's the hamsters. I love that. It's those key hamsters.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.520]   You know, they made them skinny though. That doesn't work.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.920]   Look at them. Now you can watch it. They're skinny. They look like the hamsters look like Justin
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.960]   Timberlake. That's a little weird. You can't have them here. All right. So let's just see what's
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:14.160]   going on. People with long hair talking to microphones or smoke.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.040]   Oh, this is one of those things where they put colored dust.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:25.680]   I don't know. Shouldn't there be more than 168,000 people watching this right now?
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.280]   There should be. There should be. That's how many people will watch us.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.920]   Why is that mean? Yeah. You should do a music award show, Leo.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   Maybe I listened to the boat. Literally. Are you sure you're watching the right video?
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.480]   Yeah. I don't know. How do you know? I don't know. They got 76,000 upvotes,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.760]   18,000 downvotes. Yeah. I'm watching it now too. Yeah.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:53.120]   Yeah. 172,000 were up to you. Oh, it's growing. Okay. So there you go.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:59.040]   So these are, this is the, these are video. This is like them competing with MTV's Video Music Awards.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:05.440]   But so are they celebrating the YouTube stars? Well, that's what they, that was the mistake
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:11.600]   they made in 2008. Well, you know, they have Tays on Day, you know, going to joke.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:17.280]   Let's read. And that, you know, now this looks like it's Nicki Minaj, his lady Gaga. It's, you know,
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:23.200]   it's the big stars M&M. Well, they do seem to have, you know, the epic rap battles.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.600]   Yeah. Okay. So this is a YouTube phenomenon. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe they're mixing the two.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:32.480]   There you are. Because then it's Taylor Swift mixed with epic rap battles. What category could
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:39.120]   this possibly be? Well, I guess, yeah, music videos and Taylor Swift is an M&M are definitely
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:45.120]   some of the most watched videos on YouTube stuff. Well, it makes sense. I mean, it didn't,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:50.240]   doesn't YouTube replace MTV for music videos? Nobody watches it. I don't watch MTV for music
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.640]   videos. You haven't. Yeah, because they don't have them. There is still an MTV, but it's a reality
[00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.560]   show network now. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm telling you, if they don't have Miley Cyrus twerking,
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:07.680]   I don't want to watch it. So there you go. Let's talk about the iPad air, the new thin iPad.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.440]   We took it apart at the beginning of the show, but Tim Stevens, you've actually spent some time.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:17.920]   How long have you had to review it? I had, what's about a week to review the iPad?
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.560]   So a fair amount of time. And yeah, I found myself quite quite enamored with the thing. I mean,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.120]   it's obviously nothing significantly different from a user building standpoint from the fourth
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.840]   generation iPad. But I was found the older iPad has to be like surprisingly heavy. Every time I
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.440]   pick it up, I think, Oh, this thing's heavier than it should be. And now, you know, it feels
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   lighter than it should be. I remember the first time I picked up an iPad mini last year, and I was
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.920]   surprised at how thin and light it was, as much as that same sort of initial sensation when you
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.080]   pick up the new iPad air, it's very thin, very light. But yet, impressively, the battery life
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.560]   tests that we ran came out. All it's exactly the same as the fourth gen iPad. So it scored,
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.280]   I think 13 hours on our rundown test, which is exactly the same as last year's.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.760]   And that's despite having about one third less battery, I think if I remember correctly from
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.560]   from the ethics of guys we're saying before, so it's quite impressive. And the benchmarks are,
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:12.160]   you know, off the charts of the last year, it's roughly, you know, 75 to 100% faster than last
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.840]   year's model in most in most tests, which is which is again, quite impressive considering
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.280]   you got less battery on board. Indeed, in some of the benchmarks, the single core performance of the
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.320]   A7 was better than the dual core performance of the A6X from last year. So that's also impressive.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.120]   It is running slightly faster than the A7 in the iPhone 5s. I think it's 100 megahertz faster,
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.600]   so it's clocked up a bit. And I'm actually curious to see what they clocked the A7 at in the iPad
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.280]   mini retina that's coming up. I'm wondering if they'll keep that at the iPhone 5s speed,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.800]   maybe to give the air a bit of an advantage on the performance side. I don't know,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.360]   just scheming a little bit there. But performance was great, better life is great. It's really thin,
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.880]   really bite. I think I like the new ship a lot better. It's more comfortable in the hand. You
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.680]   can find the buttons a lot more easily. My only complaints were one was his minor. There are
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.360]   stereo speakers now, which is nice, but they're both on the same side, which is unfortunate.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.160]   I would have liked to see one of the speakers on the top. So when you hold it side, but it's
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.320]   actually gets stereo sound. They're about as close together as stereo speakers could get.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.200]   Yeah, it's better than before, but I was fascinated by the lightning cable for it.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.080]   Yeah. And it is much louder than before too, so that's good. But it would have been nice if they
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.200]   put the other speaker on the top where it should be. The other complaint, of course, is the lack of
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:25.120]   touch ID. That's the fingerprint sensor in the iPhone 5S, of course. And while most iPads never
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.080]   leave the home according to most studies that really, so security is not really an issue here
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.720]   as much, but still it's more of a convenience thing for me because every time you buy something in the
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.040]   iTunes app store, download a song or something like that, it's a type in your password, which
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.960]   is really annoying. But on the iPhone 5S, of course, you just hit the home button with your finger
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.720]   and you get signed in automatically. It does squeal you. Doesn't it after you use that for a little while?
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.160]   It's just like Kila sentry on a car or something like that. If you ever go to a car that doesn't have
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.120]   that, you're like, I don't open the door again. So the first time I turned on the iPad Air, I
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.520]   had my finger hit the home button, held my finger there and was thinking, what's wrong with this iPad?
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.520]   It won't sign me in and then I had to type in my password. Do you think as run with scissors,
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.160]   doesn't it says in the chatroom that Apple is slow playing it that they could put a sensor on here,
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.720]   but that gives them something to sell next year, right? I'm inclined to think so. If you look what
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.400]   they did with Siri last year coming out, I think it was last year in the forest first,
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.840]   two years ago, I'm sorry, was in the forest first and then it came out later.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.280]   I think it's very similar here. We'll probably see them next generation iPad and it'll be something
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.520]   exclusive for the 5S for a little while. But then again, it's possible that came late to the game
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.720]   and the iPad design was a little bit further long. Maybe they couldn't fit it in there.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.440]   Or maybe it's a thickness thing too, the iPad Air's thinner. But yeah, I'm not sure. If anything,
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.760]   it might give them something extra. It could be that too, for sure.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.800]   Tim, do we know if the iPad Mini with Retina has serious speakers as well?
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.280]   It should. Yeah, the current Mini has serious speakers.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.960]   Oh, it does look it. I wasn't sure. It does. But it's the same thing, they're both on the same
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   sides. And it's very, very difficult to tell the two channels apart.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:06.480]   Well, that's kind of interesting too, is that for the first time, the Mini with Retina is
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.240]   functionally the same as the Big Brother iPad. It is. Yeah, same CPU, same RAM, same resolution.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.920]   The only question again in my mind is the clock speed on that A7, which we'll have to wait and
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   find out. We can run some benchmarks on it. But yeah, I mean, for me, I like last year's Mini
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.480]   better than the fourth gen iPad. And this year, I mean, I'm pretty excited to see what the new
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.360]   Mini with Retina can do. If it's got similar specs and similar battery life to the iPad Air,
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.440]   that to me will be the one to get. I'm curious if you had the same reaction I did. I've only
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.520]   had it for a couple of days. I got it on Friday that I was surprised almost immediately started
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.720]   using in portrait mode, not landscape mode. The older, yeah, because of the narrower bezels,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.080]   I just felt more comfortable. I was typing with my thumbs, which I can't really do
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.120]   on the previous generations iPad. It just felt natural in a portrait mode. And I think just a
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.840]   little bit thinner, a little bit lighter was enough to make that transition. I'm a big fan of as you
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.440]   are the Mini, and I will be in line to get the Mini with Retina. I think that's the one I want.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.120]   I'm very excited by that, too. I can't imagine what could be wrong with it, especially for
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.760]   $100 less for similar specs, if not identical specs to the iPad Air.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.160]   I mean, if you want the bigger display, obviously it's a great tablet for sure. There's absolutely
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.200]   nothing wrong with it. I think it's fantastic. It's a really nice update over last year. But
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.400]   to be, I'm really excited to test out the Mini. Apple's big problem is it's, yeah, it's a lot
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.240]   faster, et cetera, et cetera. But I mean, I could tell the difference in speed, but I didn't feel,
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.000]   I even don't even have an iPad fourth generation. I go back to the third generation,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.320]   and I didn't ever feel like it was slow. I think that's going to be a problem with consumers.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:41.920]   They're just going to say, "Well, okay, but there's no reason to trade in my old one for a little
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:49.760]   thinner, a little faster." I think certainly my iPad 3 is fine. It's fine. It's tech-confused.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.240]   So definitely understand what you're saying. Do you disagree, Tim? I mean,
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:00.160]   what isn't that the challenge for Apple is to convince people to upgrade? Yeah, it certainly is.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.840]   And I think one of the mistakes that they've been making for the past few generations is that
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.760]   the iPad has looked exactly the same, especially if you go from third to fourth generation.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.480]   There's really been no differentiation between them. So having a new style at least gives people
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.400]   some reason to upgrade because now they can actually look and feel something significantly
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.560]   different from before. So that's nice. But ultimately, the rule of thumb has typically been,
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.920]   if you've got last generation, don't bother. If you have the second generation before,
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.280]   maybe think about upgrading. If your three generation is old, it's probably time to get the new one.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.840]   And I think that more or less rings true here. But I'm also curious if Apple will come out with
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.240]   something new because they did change the name to be iPad Air. I've been wanting them to do a pro
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.680]   tablet and a pro phone for a long time. And I think this is a great opportunity for them in
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:45.680]   2014 to slot in a slightly larger, more powerful, maybe something with a stylus tablet. I think
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.640]   that'd be fantastic. I think the market would really like them. Really? A stylus? I mean, think
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:07:03.200]   about it. How many Apple designers and graphic engineers have some sort of a wackam style is
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.360]   sitting at their desk top that they spent a ridiculous amount of money to get. And if you can
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.960]   have an iPad that would double as that functionality, but you could also pick it up and take it to a
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.680]   meeting and then pick it up and take it home with you. I think a lot of Apple's professional users
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.720]   would really, really dig that sort of thing. And they'd pay big bucks or that sort of thing too.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.480]   And it'd be an interesting product. I would love to see that kind of thing. I don't know
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.200]   whether we'll actually see it, but I think it'd be a pretty cool product.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.040]   You're not the only one. Tim's not a crank. He's not the only one calling for this. And I
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.840]   understand that one would be a prank. If you play with a note three or the note two or even the
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.440]   know one, you realize there is some value to it pressure sensitive stylus on a tablet. But
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.920]   remember that Steve Jobs, the big thing when he released the when they announced the iPhone was
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.240]   no stylus. Your finger is the stylus. Yeah, if you see stylus, you blew it was just quote.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:53.280]   Yeah. Task manager too. But I think you could argue that being able to kill tasks in iOS is
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.000]   something of a task manager. But he was talking about the usability of keyboards and things like
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.520]   that on a smartphone. And ultimately, there have been styluses on on apples forever.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.760]   And I don't think that would be breaking anything. But ultimately, he also said,
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.240]   this is the right size for the phone and they changed that too. And rules are meant to be broken.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:18.000]   Yeah. No, that's right. Then Apple's many times turned around and done exactly the opposite
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.200]   of what Steve said, even on Steve's watch. I think the iPad is the first one that I'd consider getting.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.360]   I mean, you don't have an iPad. You'd never had an iPad.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:35.760]   Oh, I'll review you. It's a mini, but you know, I have a mini, but the size is like the original
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:42.480]   iPads was so big. The two, the three, the four, they're all terribly big. So I don't know. This
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.240]   is appealing. This is really sexy to me. This is the prettiest tablet that's attended in short
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.560]   nine inch tablet I've seen. It is gorgeous. And this is where Apple really knows what they're doing.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.960]   I mean, the look and the feel and the styling, it's not recyclable. I mean, we know it's not
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.240]   repairable, but it does. It really feels good. In the hand that having been said, I am a mini fan.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.040]   I wonder, I don't know if they've broken down the sales figures. I feel like the mini must be the
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:13.920]   that's the form factor people really want, right? Most of the people definitely. It does seem like
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:20.880]   it's the most popular of the of their tablets. And especially now that the retina is going to be
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.000]   available, that's what everyone was waiting for. That's the one. And yeah. But you know, the thing
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.840]   is that the iPad Air is closer in weight to the to the mini than it is to the previous
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.840]   full size generation. Right. So that's also and when the media came out, everyone was puzzled by
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.320]   the price, but it seems that really not that important for people who want that tablet and
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.400]   it's selling really well. So it wouldn't surprise me at all that it's selling even better than the
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:57.520]   the full sized iPad. Well, one person who will not be buying an iPad Ashton Kutcher is
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:07.760]   he's he's a product engineer at Lenovo now. Does that make you want to buy a Lenovo product? Not me.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.920]   It makes me want to run in the other direction. I'm a huge little fan.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.440]   And this doesn't exactly raise the credit. I mean, I've spoken with Ashton. He's a very bright guy.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.800]   And he actually is very passionate about technology for sure. But ultimately, you know,
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.400]   I just have this immediate negative reaction whenever there are these celebrity executive
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.320]   appointments like Alicia Keys with Blackberry and any of those things like that. I immediately
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.920]   think this is this is there's something wrong with this company. They're willing to make this
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.840]   one. It started two three years ago when Lady Gaga made products for Polaroid products,
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.480]   which you never appear. Remember that? And then Alicia Keys at Blackberry Shakira is team mobile
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:51.760]   collaborator. Oh, I want to phone Shakira. It is. These chips don't lie.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:11:00.480]   And you know, out of all of those, Ashton Kutcher is the one that has been showing the most
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.240]   interest. No, at least he has some tech champs. But yeah, it's very difficult to take this
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.160]   seriously. And I would love to be proven wrong. Ashton, go ahead, you know, do something amazing.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:20.000]   But it doesn't sound like it's like Betty Crocker. He's not good. What is he going to? Oh,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.840]   can you imagine how insulting you're a Lenovo designer? You've been working at this all your
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.520]   life. You've got many degrees. We've brought an ash to Kutcher star of that 70s show here to help
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.800]   you design the next Lenovo. Hope you enjoy it. And Lenovo's been doing great. I mean,
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.880]   they're one of the few manufacturers who've kind of begun to figure out this whole hybrid
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.640]   ultra book and convertible. I like the yoga. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas everybody else is really
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.520]   struggling to make that work. But Lenovo's been doing yoga as great. They're on their second
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.480]   generation of yogas now. And they've got, you know, I think three different model yogas now.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.560]   They're all really nice. So the Lenovo's got that figured out. They definitely could use
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.560]   some help on the smartphone side of things, I think. But ultimately, you know, I don't think,
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.560]   I mean, I think they're probably looking for more perspective on the US market and Ashton could
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.280]   probably help in that regard to some degree. And he can certainly help. They think anyway to raise
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.080]   the brand awareness. But but man, it's just this is never worked in the past. And I just don't
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.760]   think it's going to work here. Ashton Kutcher says, let me tell you, I could say one of the big
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:19.360]   differences between me and Alicia Keys. I went to school for engineering. Well, I didn't graduate,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.600]   but I learned a program when I was 19 years old. And I work on a daily basis with engineers at
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.000]   a building some of the finest software products in the world today. I bet if you asked a lot of
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.520]   these people what a MySQL databases, they probably run the other way and not even know what it is.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:45.280]   What do you do? Yes, Ashton. Well, at least, you know, I came into the show fully prepared to
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:51.120]   shoot down Kutcher. But it's true. He probably, if he does know what a, what a, you know,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:58.160]   MySQL databases. Is it something? Hey, he wants just like Steve Jobs. That's worth something.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.760]   That's exactly why they hired him because he's Steve Jobs. They thought they were actually hiring
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.160]   Steve Jobs. Steve's gone, but we've got Ashton Kutcher. There's good news and there's bad news.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   There's definitely, this is definitely a marketing move. Does anyone think it's going to help them
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.960]   in that department? Is it going to build brand awareness? Did he build brand awareness for,
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.480]   was it canon he was doing the ads for Nikon? Nikon, wasn't it?
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:28.640]   See, Joe's what I saw a lot of those ads. I don't know. It didn't make me want to run out and buy
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:39.120]   Nikon glass. All right. Let's, I'm going to move on. I want to talk a little bit about the airplane
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:46.960]   decision. I think that's a big deal. Roger Victor. Roger Victor, Roger.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.520]   Fluidomat Friday. What's your vector vector?
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:14:00.480]   And 4k video on its way from an unlikely source. But first, if you missed anything on
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.040]   Twit this week, you missed a lot. Let's take a look.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:10.320]   Sleep on Twit. Tech news today. Cecilia Bade just received a ticket for driving while wearing
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:16.320]   Google glass. There's a very clear solution to this guy's self driving cars. This week in Google.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.040]   Google plus increased the number of objects that Google search can recognize inside your photos
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:25.360]   to over a thousand. You can even search for people's names. I forgot I had this video. This is
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:32.000]   Henry my son reading for the very first time. Oh, he has a Hogwarts shirt on. Oh my god.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.920]   Gizwiz. This my friends. Yeah. Is a lifespan. Treadmill desk. I've been walking. Were you walking
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.560]   the entire time? This whole time. I have a better way for you to get exercise. What is that?
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   Ticking.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:51.440]   We've got technology out the squeaker.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:58.640]   We do. We have. That's our new slogan. I hope you like it. Technology out the squeaker.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:05.840]   Show today brought to you by friends at audible.com. Audio books for me were a lifesaver when I
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:13.120]   was commuting to tech TV. I first joined Audible in the year 2000. I remember 13 years. And I,
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.840]   you know, I was about to kill somebody commuting two hours a day. I was just a nightmare. I was
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.520]   so tired of the commute and so tired of bad traffic and rush hour. And that's when it really
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.360]   changed my life because I started listening to audio books and all of a sudden I don't want
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:32.480]   to get out of the car. I drive around the block a couple extra times at the gym on the treadmill.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.600]   Nothing more boring, but boy, it sure is great to listen to books from audible.com. I want you to
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.880]   visit audible.com and you'll be amazed just even on the front page. You'll say, Oh, I'd like to
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.960]   read that. Oh, that looks interesting. There it looks. Oh, that's a good book. How about this?
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.800]   The summer of beer and whiskey? You had me at beer. How brewers bar keeps rowdy's immigrants
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.120]   and a wild pennant fight made baseball's America's game. That's a baseball book. I just listened to,
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.760]   you know, that I'm going tonight to see enders game. Don't don't tell me. No spoilers.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:11.200]   But I had read the enders game. In fact, I listened to it on audible. They have a great 20th anniversary
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:18.000]   edition of enders game. But I wanted a refresher and this was great. I have to say it's the full cast
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   audio play. It's not the book itself. In fact, Orson Scott card wrote the script for this
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.520]   and they've got really great performers. And I remind me how much I love listening to radio
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:37.360]   drama. It's it's you're listening to enders game. It's a great cast, really, really well acted and
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.320]   just a lot of fun. I think Harlan Ellison makes a surprise appearance somewhere in that
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:48.560]   cast original music by Janice and it's really good. Now here's the deal. I'm going to get you
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:56.400]   two books free. That's how nice I am. Look at this. The revolution was televised. I always like
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:04.560]   reading books about TV. This is the cops, crooks, slingers and slayers who change TV drama forever.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:11.520]   Wow, this sounds interesting. This is about the sopranos, Oz, the wire, deadwood, the shield,
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.640]   lost Buffy the vampires layer, battle star galactic of 24 Friday nightlights and madmen
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.080]   breaking bad. So it's the story of those 12 shows with interviews with David Chase and Vince
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.680]   Gilligan. That sounds great. Like that's the problem. You got you could audible.com. It's hard

[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.960]   forever. Audible's just doing a great job. They're recording a lot of science fiction that was
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.960]   never made into audiobooks. In fact, that enters game as an audio, an Audible's studio's production.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:05.360]   40 actors, 100 roles. Really, really great. Pick two. Listen. You'll love it. I guarantee it.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.960]   Fiction, nonfiction. I listen to a lot of history. There's always something great to listen to.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:19.200]   Audible.com/twit2. Simon Singh has a new book. He wrote a great book on crypto. His newest is
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:28.560]   The Simpsons and their mathematical secrets. What could that be? Insight into the celebrated television
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:39.120]   series The Simpsons. Huh. As an explanation of mathematics, that's just bizarre. I don't even
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.920]   know what- I just have to do with Homer's gut. I don't even- Yeah. In the shape of a donut. It's
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:51.280]   pie. Pie are squared, but donuts are round. I somehow lost your video, but hopefully I'm clear
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:59.520]   now. Mr. Brian, would you push that magic button that sends Miriam our video? Oh, it's Leo. Yeah, I'm
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.520]   back, baby. Audible.com/twit2. We thank them for their support of this weekend tech. You can now
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:12.720]   fly gate to gate on Delta and JetBlue, keeping your Kindle going, your phone. We can't use a phone,
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.880]   but you can use the data. No, you can't use the data. You can't use the phone text or data,
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:24.560]   but you can at least play Plants vs. Zombies. From gate to gate, the FAA has issued new guidelines.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:30.960]   Interestingly, JetBlue and Delta were on that committee, and they're the first airplanes,
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:36.960]   airlines to do it. I think there's some face saving here because they said, "Well, now not every
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:43.760]   airline could do it until we make sure that their planes are shielded." As if the Kindle-- You know
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.200]   that. You know what I said earlier. That's a load of beep. I think it's face saving. I don't
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.160]   think there was ever an issue. It was all anecdotal, right? Exactly. Tim, you fly with Delta a lot,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.880]   right? I was on a Delta flight from Detroit, San Francisco. When this was announced, as a matter
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.640]   of fact, so I was very excited. I was on GoGo reading the news about it and I'm very excited
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.240]   to wait. I was on a flight back home on Friday, and I got to use my-- I was playing Fire Emblem on
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:14.320]   my 3DS during takeoff, so that was great. Did you feel a little wicked doing it? Like,
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:19.920]   "Ooh, I'm breaking the rule." A little bit, but I think it was last year I was on a Delta flight,
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.240]   and there was an off-duty stewardess who was sitting next to me, and she was texting during
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.360]   takeoff. Ever since that, I've pretty much just considered that rule to be bogus anyway.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:36.000]   The video that JetBlue released of the first-- they call them PEDs. Personal electronic device
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.560]   approved flight, it was flight 2302 from JFK to Buffalo. That's probably a flight you've been on.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:47.040]   It's a short one. That's one where you definitely want that because you hardly ever go over 10,000.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:53.280]   Right. Right. It was also unfortunate because Delta had just launched their new holiday-themed
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.640]   instructional video that they played at the beginning of the plane, which I think was the first
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.600]   week they were playing it. Of course, that still says that you had to turn off your
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.160]   device or so. Now their new video is obsolete, sadly.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:08.160]   That was one consideration people said is that, "Well, if everybody's playing games,
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:15.120]   they're going to watch the safety video." I think what that's done actually is create
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:21.920]   a brisk market in creative safety videos. Definitely a bit of a cold war going on there,
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.840]   not even a cold war. Everybody's doing these wacky, funny videos now that try to keep you
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:32.240]   interested. The new Delta ones got reindeer and seats and lots of craziness for sure.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:35.520]   It's Delta-Lena in it though, because I'm in love with Delta-Lena.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.720]   I don't think she was in this new-
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.120]   Red-head who goes on. No smoking.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.440]   She had a cameo in the last one, but I don't think she was in this new-
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:46.960]   No, don't you love that? Of course, Ale Newey, Air New Zealand is famous for their
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.520]   in-flight safety. They had one with Peter Jackson and a bunch of hobbits. They've just
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.840]   released their newest. Would you like to see it featuring Get Ready? Betty White.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.920]   Oh my.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.360]   They're at a retirement.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   This is my cousin's grandson and his buddy from Air New Zealand. They were telling me about
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:15.760]   their crazy safety videos. Well, I said, "If you want to know about survival, talk to us,
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.000]   because you're going to want some advice from folks who have been there and done there."
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.840]   Oh, this is safety. All school style.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.960]   What did she say?
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:37.360]   What's really funny is a little later on Gavin McCloud, the skipper of the love boat,
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.760]   makes it- here you go.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.480]   We're in the box.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.600]   Oh hi, Betty.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.120]   This is a priceless antique.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.360]   A priceless antique? What is it?
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.560]   Your sense of humor.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.240]   Welcome aboard, Gavin.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.800]   Well, I think this is great. I think this makes you want to watch the safety video.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.400]   If you want to get a new feeling, actually.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.160]   You're going to- yeah, makes you want to go to New Zealand. That's right.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:09.840]   They do great stuff. And I think that probably all the airlines will be doing that now because
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.560]   otherwise it's angry birds.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:17.920]   So does it include- it's just phones and tablets, right? It doesn't include like the laptops.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.080]   It was interesting. They said anything less than two pounds, which was an odd sort of distinction
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.480]   for me. So you could theoretically get away with, I think, like an 11-inch share, so just under two
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.640]   pounds, round two. So I don't think they would let anybody with a laptop on, but that was their
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.560]   rule of thumb anyway. I'm guessing that'll get refined. The other thing to note is that if you're
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.400]   on a Delta connection flight, which I think there's seven airlines included there,
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.000]   you will not be able to do this. It's only Delta, the main Delta flights,
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.920]   and you'll still have to turn your devices off. And they said it's coming soon, but they didn't
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.840]   know when. Apparently JetBlue watches this show. They've just tweeted me.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.080]   Leo LaPorte, tank girl, Tim Steve is not Patrick. If it's important to our customers,
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.160]   it's important to us. Aw, shot. But you have to figure that JetBlue and Delta, at least in
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.240]   probably every airline, we're getting pressure. I know Nick Bilton of The New York Times has
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:09.120]   wrote a series of articles that really put the screws to these guys saying, why can't we
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.400]   use our devices, especially like a Kindle? You got the pilot up front, all of them carrying iPads
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.080]   now, all their flight manifests, everything on iPads. And a Kindle puts out no energy at all.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:27.760]   Why can't we use our Kindles? Why do I? I used to buy people magazine. The only time I ever
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.480]   reads People Magazine is for flights take off and landing. So at least I wouldn't have to look
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:39.040]   out the window and worry. Oh, maybe they were being lobbied by the magazine industry.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.680]   I'm definitely concerned about what this means for the print industry because I have a couple
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.000]   magazine subscriptions that I pretty much have exclusively for flights in the magazine and I'll
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.280]   put it in my bag and I'll try to forget about it until the flight. Then I'll read it on the flight
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:57.440]   and nowhere else. And now I don't really need those anymore. Was there, do you think, any real
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.640]   technical issue? Why were these rules? I think it's just the distraction thing. I think that
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.560]   they wanted people to pay attention. And if there is something that's going to go wrong in the
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.160]   flight, I think that's the time it's most likely to happen. And that's the time they want to be
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.680]   paying attention. But ultimately, there's in flight entertainment and a lot of the systems
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.120]   work during take off and landing. You can listen to the radio during take off and landing.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:21.200]   So I think that's a little bit of a dubious thing. The other thing is I don't think they want
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.000]   these devices flying around if there's some sort of an accident. Yeah. Something that we
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.200]   limit. I used to indicate that for sure. You know, two pounds. You know,
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.680]   anything bigger than that is going to hurt you if it flies in your face.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.320]   Now I am glad that they and this is, we might make this point that they did not approve the
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.280]   use of cell phones in flight. The last thing you want, it's such a pain that but when somebody
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.360]   sits next to you, you go, Oh yeah. And then another thing I told him, you can take this job.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.920]   And nobody talks at a normal voice in a cell phone. They're all shouting. That would be the end
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.240]   of the world. If you ask me. Now I don't think that's an FAA decision. I think that is,
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:03.520]   I've been told that has to do with the FCC. And the real issue is cell carriers don't want it
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.400]   because of the rapid handoffs. If you've got somebody flying 600 miles an hour,
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.200]   cell site to cell site to cell site, they're hammering those sites.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:17.760]   You know what they just answered about the two pound limit. They said,
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:23.040]   trays need to be up so handheld only on Twitter. Thank you. Just listening,
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.400]   Jeb Luke. When are you coming to Albany?
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.320]   Get a tweet. Okay. I'm listening.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:35.760]   About the restrictions and the reason why. I guess maybe they didn't do any testing. But
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.600]   these things, the demand for this is relatively new. It's been probably around five years when
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.720]   people started having real smartphones. And of course, with the administration's glacial pace,
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:54.960]   it's going to take a little bit of time. But in this case, we all know that this is probably
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.160]   not something bad and probably nothing's going to happen. But don't you want them to make sure?
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.640]   Yeah, you don't want to be the person who picked up your iPad and brought the plane down.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:10.960]   Exactly. So you still want, I understand that it's unbearable to not have your iPad to play on
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:18.160]   for 10 minutes. But I understand that they wanted to make sure. Now, did they actually
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.040]   use this time to make sure? I guess there's probably a little bit of, they also didn't want to be
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:29.600]   the first people to say, you know what, go ahead, use it and then make a mistake. But still, I'm not,
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:36.160]   I'm not what I'm saying is we didn't want them to just hand it, you know, phone it in and just
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.280]   say, all right, it's all right, just use it. Never mind. And we'll see what happens.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:48.000]   Yeah. Well, but then they say in this article that all the aircrafts have to complete a quote
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.920]   carrier defined PED tolerance test, not the FAA. The carrier says, well, this is our test.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.480]   The other thing of course is that, and I think that you should prepare yourself for this.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.040]   The FAA may approve it, the carriers may approve it, but each captain is responsible for that flight.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.360]   And if a captain says, I'm not going to allow it, the rule will still apply.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:19.600]   You're screwed. So you know, they use iPads for in cockpit nowadays, right, for their flight bag
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.400]   or whatever it's called. So I'm kind of questioning, like, I really don't think anything that's
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.360]   gone through the FCC and be to prove as class, whatever class B or whatever,
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.200]   is going to be a problem, you know. And you were talking about cell handoffs. I think what they
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.480]   could do is have a cell on board the plane and allow text messaging only, no voice, no data.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:46.080]   And that way you could be on the Wi-Fi for the data and you could just text each other.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.760]   I would relate to the ground in some way or another. You know, I think that's the future.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.920]   I'd like to see that actually. Well, you could use, you know, you can now use Hangouts,
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.960]   you could use Google Voice, you could use messages and use the Wi-Fi and be texting all your work.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.800]   For sure. But I mean, the average person doesn't necessarily know how to do that, right? So I mean,
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.600]   being able to just text is, you know, and then the carriers could charge a roaming fee, you know,
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.280]   it'd be cool. Everyone makes money. Everybody wins.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:15.680]   And Jeb Lue did just tweet back at me and asked me if Newberg is good enough.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:21.920]   He's not good enough. You said I am building a airport. This is very weird.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:30.400]   You know, there obviously brands have become very aware of how important it is to interact.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.800]   In social media, there's a very interesting article and I think it was in the Sunday times
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:42.400]   today about Gary Vaynerchuk, which I didn't even know. But Gary, no longer, you know, for a long
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.840]   time, he was doing Wine Library TV. He got very well known as a podcaster and it was his dad's
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:57.440]   wine business. But apparently a couple of years ago, he started his own social media agency.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:04.240]   So he's actually selling, let me go to the front page of this article. Here's Gary with his team.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.240]   He's selling, you know, to big companies like General Electric's social media advice.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:17.840]   And one of the things Kerry says, his new book is called, let me see, it has the title here,
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:25.680]   "Jab, jab, jab, right hook." And the idea is that you jab somebody on Twitter as, by the way,
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.560]   Jeb Lue was doing, jab, jab, jab. See, what Gary does, for instance, is say, "What can I do
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.320]   for you? Any of you, any of my followers?" And somebody says, "Get me a cheeseburger." And a cheeseburger
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.480]   arrives the next day at the guy's house. That's the jab. You'll do that three times. But then the
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.600]   right hook is, "Now, hey, have you bought my book?" And the guy says, "Well, I'm compelled to at this
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:50.240]   point." And so basically the premise apparently of this company is everything that goes on on Twitter
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:58.240]   is about selling. I really hate that. And that makes me sad, frankly. I think that's...
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.520]   That's terrible. I think that's pollution. It's noise pollution.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:09.920]   We'll get Gary. I like Gary. Gary's a friend. And going back to his, he convinced GE to mail
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.440]   Thir 314 pies in March, like Apple pies, because it was Pi Day.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:24.080]   Wow. So if you tweeted about Pi on Pi Day at March 14th, GE sent you a pie. Not, but only the
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:32.720]   first... Get it 3.1415. Only the first 314 people. Is that a great strategy for general electric?
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:39.280]   There are anything that gets them mentioned, I guess. Are they some microwaves?
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:47.120]   It's good. Well, it's brand building. They probably got a couple of articles about this.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:52.960]   Social media is obviously going to be used for those people that he's counseling or that he's
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:32:00.080]   no, well, maybe not counseling. But yeah, counseling. No, he's like an ad agency.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:07.200]   Counseling. Yeah. They want to get some marketing. It's out of the marketing budget. So they're
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:12.640]   not doing the Twitter thing out of the goodness of their heart. I'm sure some of it has to do
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:22.800]   with customer satisfaction. But a lot of it is also communication and marketing. So in that sense,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:33.520]   the cost of 314 pies to get your name mentioned again and again, what is it now? 6, 7, 8 months later
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:38.000]   on this show. We're mentioning it. New York Times has mentioned it. There you go.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.240]   I can understand where they're coming from. Just depressing. Because, look, pies arrive cold,
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:50.240]   and then you need to put them in your GE microwave. Nobody microwaves pies? That's a horrible thing
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:59.120]   to do to a pie. I know. But think about their strategy here. You have to use a general electric
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:05.440]   light bulb to see the pie. And then after you eat too many pies, they'll give you an MRI in a
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:11.120]   general electric MRI machine. And you'll just feel right at home. That's the Google strategy.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:19.280]   The more people eat pies, the more they need our products. The motto on an enormous black
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.600]   bird, according to the New York Times, as you walk into VaynerMedia is, and they say,
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:29.760]   this is the G-rated version. You can supply your own expletives. We love social media because it
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:38.640]   sells things. Well, why do you do social media? I'm sure to an extent it's because you like it,
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:44.160]   but don't you also use it as a, well, maybe not advertising, but to get your name out there and
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.880]   to get people. Yeah. But I think that that's the, that when people do that on Twitter or anywhere else,
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:54.000]   I tune them out. And eventually I unfollow them. I want them to provide some value or at least
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.720]   have some conversations or, you know what I'm saying? Sure. But you have, you have the Twitch
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.200]   account, which announces that. Yeah, that's all that does. That account gives you no value at all.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:12.480]   Yeah, maybe. I mean, it does, it does get the show advertised. Right. So no, yeah, we use it that
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.280]   way too. But I just, I feel like that's, that seems like the least important use of social media.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.840]   Right. Or maybe not. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. Well, it's important. It's just not very
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.840]   enjoyable. I guess no one goes to Twitter to get, you know, more goods. Yeah, exactly. You're not
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.560]   going to, so customer support maybe, but you're not going to go to Twitter to get G.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:39.120]   It feels cynical to go on to Twitter and say, okay, ask me for something and then do that for them.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.800]   And then later turn around and say, now are you going to buy my book? It feels a little cynical to
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:48.160]   do that. I don't know. We'll get Gary on and we'll ask him. What, you know, our Twitch live feed,
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:52.400]   you could follow that. And I think, can say that more informational than advertised. I don't think
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:58.480]   anybody follows the feed and then says, Oh, look, the show's on and goes to watch it. I think they've,
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:03.040]   that's more informational, but I don't know. I don't know. See, it's just all, but you know,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.160]   if you're following that, you know what you're following. It says, what's going on.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.080]   Do we even do that? Is that our feed or is somebody else do that?
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.280]   We do it. It still, we should update it. It says, Twitch cottage.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.320]   We do it, but just not very well. It's only been two years since we moved.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:33.200]   Even even Gary's the jab, jab, jab thing. I mean, he's, if he pays, you know, three cheeseburgers to a
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.560]   guy before the guy can buy his book. It's a problem. Not very. Yeah. It's a net loss.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.800]   So I don't know how exact that. Gary's changed a little bit because originally it was the thank you,
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:51.360]   thank you culture where you thank people, you thank people. Now it's a cell. Now it's a sell you.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:58.560]   Picture. Well, he's, I guess he's also talking to, to the brands that he's, he's advising, right?
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.760]   And they want to sell. That's what they see there. So I guess he's sort of repackaging his
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:09.840]   messaging of you have to interact, you have to show that you care for in order to build that
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:16.240]   relationship with your, with your customers. And those brands, the way they understand it is,
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.560]   you know, you're going to make more money. Well, I think with JetBlue, the reason I came up was
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:26.000]   because you've JetBlue's responding to us in real time during the show. That's pretty smart.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.240]   Yeah. And that's, that's kind of what that is, is engaging in a conversation, which I like.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:38.240]   That's what to me social media is about is having a conversation. I like that. But I don't know.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.800]   I like Gary. We'll have him on. I'll ask him, Gary, what the hell?
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:47.280]   By the way, we use his last name as a swear filter. Whenever a swear word appears in the chat room,
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:53.440]   we replace it with Vaynerchuk. Seriously. I don't know why we've done that for years,
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.480]   because it sounds like it's, it's benign, but it sounds like maybe you're swearing.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:03.200]   You, Vaynerchuk. I haven't seen the test yet. I'm waiting. Oh, they will.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.480]   Now that I've mentioned it, get ready. You're going to have a very, a Vayner flood.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:16.800]   It didn't filter me yet. No, I did on the scent. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, wow. Look at that. What's funny
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:23.120]   is there's a, there's a site, foolish it.com. And anytime, anybody types foolish it, go ahead,
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:29.840]   type foolish it into a chat room. It goes f o l l I Vaynerchuk it.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:41.120]   So it's not super smart. Was it because it was a start, Leo? Was it because I interviewed Gary
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:46.400]   and he swore up a storm and that's where where that happened? Oh, that now our chat,
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:52.000]   my Dan is getting into the act. He's upset. He gets mad when I start messing with a chat like this.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.520]   I'm sorry, Dan. Don't ban me.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:05.040]   Netflix is going to start running 4K videos next year, even though no one has the bandwidth.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:12.240]   People do have 4K displays. There are a lot of cheap 4K displays is ultra HD has not been
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:15.840]   defined yet. The color space is not defined. The only thing in fact that defined is the
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:21.680]   resolution according to Scott Wilkinson, our home theater geek. So we're in early days of UHD.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:27.040]   So be silly to buy a UHD TV right now. However, if you want to see what 4K looks like on your
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:32.000]   4K display and you have the bandwidth, there are seven videos in the Netflix catalog
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:42.080]   with 4K, including El Fuente 24 MP, which is an example of 4K at 24 frames per second. It includes
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:47.840]   people riding on bicycles, scenes of a wholesale produce market and kids playing in a fountain.
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:58.640]   Gripping content from Netflix. I might let's let's start watching El Fuente. It's only 8 minutes long.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.800]   It's got 3.3 stars.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.480]   That might crash the video chat depending on the bit rate of actually yeah, I wonder what
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.840]   will happen gently. I wonder when oh I have to install. Oh, it's so light.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.160]   Even Microsoft doesn't support that anymore.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.120]   So where do you guys fall on the 4K thing? Because every time I talk about it,
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:27.280]   I have a cousin who's completely, he goes perzeric every time I mention 4K because he says
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:34.080]   anyone who's going to be watching something at a reasonable distance is not going to see the
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:41.760]   difference between HD and UHD. And apparently he threw a bunch of graphs at me that prove
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:50.400]   beyond any reasonable doubt that the distance that it becomes discernible is too short for anyone
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:57.520]   to be watching their TV at that distance. Is there any truth to that or what do you guys think?
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:04.080]   Well, I think it's like watch them but typically it's in a convention setting.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:07.280]   So you never too terribly far away from them. But yeah, I can definitely tell the difference,
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.360]   especially on these larger TVs, 65 inches and above. I think at that point, the pixel
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.400]   density gets so low that you can tell the difference. And I think even from
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.840]   slightly greater than average watching distance 10 to 15 feet, I think you'd probably be able to
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.480]   tell a difference. But it's not going to be the same sort of thing that we saw going from 480
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.400]   to 1080p. That's a huge difference. But as these panels keep getting bigger, I think that
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.640]   that resolution will continue to become more important.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:42.880]   Are you going to be watching your 60 inch panel at how far is this?
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.600]   I have a thought on that. But let me let Miriam say something.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.080]   I was just going to say it's like pixel density on phones, right? You benefit from
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.560]   higher pixel density for other things like font rendering, for example. So I'm not convinced that
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.640]   it doesn't matter. But I think Tim's right, you need to see it on large devices. And also,
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.160]   the other thing that I've noticed that remakes a difference is I've seen 8K TVs at CS and
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:12.320]   you can tell the difference. So it's like, I don't know. I mean, I think 4K is not a gimmick.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.200]   I just think it's how it's set up and implemented that matters.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:20.880]   The argument that your friend's making, Patrick, is the retina is what retina is all about.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.080]   Apple, which is a marketing term for Apple, which is not any particular pixel density,
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:32.080]   but whatever density is required so that you don't see a pixel at the normal viewing distance.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:38.160]   You went that a 1080p TV at 10 feet is retina, even though its display is not super high res,
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:42.560]   because it's of its distance. And when you hold a phone closer, you've got to have a higher pixel
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:48.480]   density for it to be retina. I think though, and maybe this is that same voodoo argument that,
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:55.280]   you know, vinyl advocates, you know, use to say vinyl is better than digital. But I think there
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.000]   is something that may not be measurable, but you definitely, your brain has a different
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.680]   experience of 4K. And if you've seen a lot of 4K and we've all seen it in the trade shows,
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:12.880]   it just looks real. And even on a small display, I was very surprised. Sony had small 4K displays,
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:17.600]   you know, 20 inches and like that, that we're using video production. And even there,
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.920]   now there, you're not 10 feet away, you're maybe only three or four feet away. But even there,
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.600]   there's something about it that makes it look more real. I think your brain does
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:29.200]   see it as reality. It looks like you're looking through a window.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:37.040]   That's funny. I did see a couple of 4K displays and it didn't really do anything for me. But then
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.920]   again, I also didn't, I wasn't blown away by the retina displays on the, you know, the first portable
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.960]   devices. It was nice, but didn't blow me away. So maybe I'm a special case.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.080]   Well, yeah, maybe that some people don't notice it. I hate 3D, for instance. I think that was a
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.800]   big gimmick. But I, and I think 4K will probably end up being a little bit of a gimmick because
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.000]   these companies are going bankrupt. They can't sell TVs. Nobody's buying HD TVs anymore.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.720]   So they've got to find a new thing to get you back. You know, you're happy, damn it. You're not
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:12.880]   supposed to be happy with your TV. You got to buy a new one. It's a tough market out there. All
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:19.040]   of these companies are struggling, losing money like crazy. I personally think 4K is where TV
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:24.400]   should go. I think 4K and high framing, you know, this is what James Cameron, the Titanic and Avatar
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.880]   guy has been advocating. Movies should be sat not only in a super high resolution, but also
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.760]   at a much higher frame rate. And when you get 4K and 60 frames or more per second,
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:40.320]   it looks pretty darn good. I think it is the difference between SD and HD. It's amazing.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.280]   I think frame rate really matters. And I think that I think you have to combine
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:51.200]   higher res and frame rate to really get the effect. And even like, if you get one of them,
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.760]   you kind of get halfway there. You know what I'm saying? Like 4K, but 30 frames per second,
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:01.040]   or even 1080p at 60 frames per second, you kind of also, your brain does something there, right?
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:07.840]   Yeah. Now the issue, of course, is content. And it's just for Netflix to say 4K streaming
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.040]   is nuts because it's going to be compressed to hell. I mean, it's not going to look good.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.600]   You can get 4K on YouTube right now, but you wouldn't know the difference.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:19.440]   Anyway, I think it's going to come. I don't know how the content is going to be delivered.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.400]   What Sony does, they give you a, is it the Red Ray? They give you the special player.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:31.280]   They give you a hard drive with 15 downloads movies. Yeah. Over time. Yeah. And then the
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.720]   Red folks are doing a Blu-ray sequel, they hope, called Red Ray. I think it's called Red Ray. That
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:42.480]   will be a higher density and big enough presumably to accommodate 4K.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:48.160]   How dramatic is the bandwidth increase when you go from, you know, HD to 4K?
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:53.520]   Well, it depends on compression. That's what all these guys say is, no, there's going to be
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.720]   new compression, better compression technologies, you know, so that you'll be able to get at only a
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:08.080]   few megabits per second 4K. I don't know. Maybe. Yeah, maybe. We're having an after
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.080]   hole with just Skype right now. Yeah, right. Exactly. We can barely get Skype to work.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.280]   Although those knives over your left shoulder are very real looking, I must say. I'm in my kitchen.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:23.200]   I am not going to antagonize you ever again, Miriam. Are those your knives? Not, yes, but not
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:30.240]   that you ever antagonize. Those look the last time you've ever antagonized. I don't, I hope never.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:37.680]   I don't, if you don't remember, I don't. Good. I just, I just, in fact, it got funded on Indiegogo,
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:44.080]   these new knives. It's a new metal technology called V matter that is, it's metal, but it's
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:49.840]   like Selenium and titanium merge together to form a glass like surface and very sharp and it never
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.400]   loses its edge. And we'll see. If you want to come over and you watch an infomercial and you
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:01.040]   called them. No, it was on Indiegogo. You did. That's so real. I'm just placing a tomato and cutting
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:07.680]   a can and half. I've seen that before. You know, Indiegogo is a new shopping channel. That's what
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.800]   it is. I think both Kickstarter and Indiegogo do have a little bit of those elements in them.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.840]   Thanks a lot longer than four to six weeks to get your product though, in most cases. At least
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.960]   it's been my experience. I bought stuff like Kickstarter I never got. I still am waiting for it. So true,
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.200]   so true. But that's the thing. You didn't buy them. Right. That's the problem. You
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.920]   contributed. Yeah. Right. You think you crossed your fingers and sent money off into the ether.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:35.440]   So I got my knives because they got funded at $100,000 and I'm getting these knives.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:42.320]   Yeah, there is an element of, of infomercial slash shopping channel. Well, when you were selling
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:46.880]   knives, it's very, it's a little different. It's selling a, you know, a space telescope,
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:53.280]   which I've also donated to. Yeah, the arc is well. Arc it. Yeah. A R K Y D. That was a success.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.480]   That that was. Yes, it was. Yeah. Look at it. They last, they never lose their edge. They're
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:05.200]   corrosion free virtually nowhere. They're two and a half times stronger. And they have a video
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:11.680]   where they bounce a ball bearing on it and bounces forever. So that you're right. It's totally an
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.240]   infomercial. That's sold you. It's totally an infomercial. Where's the tomato? Oh, look, here's
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:23.440]   an ad. The investors who want to retire competent comfortably. We're gonna take a break. We're gonna
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:28.240]   have one final segment as we continue. Great show. Thank you, you guys for being here. I really love it.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:34.720]   Miriam Chuere from PebbleWatch, get Pebble.com, Tim Stevens of Engadget and not Patrick's.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:39.200]   Have to be sure. Sir. Did I say seen it? I mean, does they engage it? I mean, seen it.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.400]   Who's that in Gaj? I don't even know who they are. What do they do anymore? I don't know.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:50.320]   You guys, did I miss something or did the verge all of a sudden verge off into like culture?
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:58.080]   You did miss it. Was that always the plan? I'm told it was always a plan for sure. I mean,
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:01.840]   they certainly launched with a very strong tech angle. But ultimately, I think that's what they,
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.280]   what, you know, that was their expertise coming out of in Gaj for the most part. But yeah,
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.360]   they're ultimately trying to be the culture of now, I think is the, the phrase.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:13.520]   You've got culture in my peanut butter. I don't, I just want gadget reviews.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.000]   Now there's an article on dead meat, how to raise livestock in a post antibiotic era and
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.560]   origami turns creepy origami turns creepy in artist paper mask portraits. What, this is not
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:32.560]   gadget reporting? That that scares me a lot because it. Well, it seems like it might be going
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:40.480]   the route of of Mashable more than wired, which is has very little to do about tech with tech now.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:46.160]   So I love the verge, but tell me that we're not in the wrong field. The tech is still going to be
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.480]   around people want tech information and news. I am not going to start doing a lifestyle channel.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:53.120]   I'm not comfortable with that. Is that I hope we're not in the work.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.400]   Well, you're trying to be trying to be obsolete. No, but that's just that's just me because I'm
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:05.440]   discursive. That's not your audience to be the. Oh, it's that's the thing. There's definitely
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.880]   an audience for for tech only reporting, but obviously the verge and like, you know, Mashable
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:16.960]   before them wants to grow their business a little bit bigger and that's what went wrong at tech TV.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.320]   In my opinion, is they said it's not enough just to do geeky stuff and do stuff for tech enthusiasts.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:26.800]   So we're going to do anime. We're going to do thunderbird. Yeah, they do all this other crap
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:31.200]   trying to get a broader audience. And at that point, they appealed to no one. It was that's
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:35.120]   when I stopped watching because it seemed like, you know, if you had shows that were culture and
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.000]   you had shows that were tech and there were complimentary, there'd be one thing, but it seemed
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.600]   like the culture stuff bled into the tech shows. And at that point, I stopped being interested
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.400]   because it was all else seemed very pandery and very, you know, lots of skately-clad girls dancing
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:50.480]   around and things like that. And for me to interview Kenny Rogers about what's on his iPod to me,
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:54.400]   which we had to do was not my choice. Right.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:59.600]   To be able to do both without alienating that core tech audience is a very difficult thing.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:03.760]   And I think that's if there's some negative feedback and we're hearing some of that now
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.360]   about the verdict is that people don't, you know, it's hard to draw the line between those two things
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.880]   and to draw people in, especially when so much of your content is tech focused.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.520]   You know, if you're then mixing in some kind of non-sequitur stuff as well, it doesn't really
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.240]   fly. But ultimately, the tech news scene is getting more challenging because these companies can
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.960]   distribute their own news as effectively as any of us can. So, you know, if your bread and butter
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.560]   is covering tech news, that's going to become a bit of a challenge. So it becomes more of how
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.320]   much value can you add to that news, how much perspective can you add to that news, and how
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.840]   much opinion can you add to that news? And I think that I mean, that's that's ultimately what we're
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:39.040]   kind of doing now. We're talking about not just what happened, but what we think about it.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.000]   So, you know, in that regard, I hope that we're safe.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.280]   I hope that I'm never doing eight cute and quirky baby announcements on Instagram.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.600]   Oh, wait a minute, I just did. Oh, they're so cute.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:57.600]   Every one of those pictures come on. And then they do the thing that really bugs me.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:02.800]   I hope I hope seeing that doesn't do where they do a slideshow so they get more views, right?
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:07.760]   And you have to walk. You have to go one by one. And each one's got its own little ad.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:15.120]   It's just very frustrating. Oh, well, but no one goes to Mashable for tech news anymore.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:22.400]   Three years ago, they were one of the big sources, right? But nowadays, Mashable has become something
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.800]   different. And that's great for them. It's a good business. But it's just it becomes something
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:34.400]   different. And, you know, someone else took their place. And if the verge diverges into something
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.240]   different as well, I'm sure someone else will come and take their place because there is
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:44.720]   a demand for tech news and tech only websites. And there are lots that are very good still, but
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:50.160]   including in podcasting, there is a demand for people who talk about tech only all the time.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:56.960]   And you do a two-hour show on one week's news, right? It's true. I wonder if there is
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.680]   potentially a way to kind of go into both directions, you know, more vertically,
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:08.720]   more acutely tech like more R's, Technica, more on on tech at the same time as going
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:13.680]   more lifestyle. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I like R's Technica. I don't want to do lifestyle.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:19.840]   I don't know. Mashable just tired. Just tired of former executive editor,
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:26.000]   chief contest officer, former managing editor at the New York Times to run their content,
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.320]   Jim Roberts. I don't know if that means that more mainstream or not, but that's certainly a big
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:35.360]   hire. Getting more serious, anyway, it seems. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by speaking
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:39.840]   to Sirius Carbonite.com. If you're not backing up that series, if you're a small business
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:45.040]   and you're trusting Joe and accounting to back up your servers, you're really in trouble because
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:51.440]   Joe forgets one day. And then the next day you get the crypto locker and you're dead. You
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.160]   imagine what a small business, if it lost all its data, it would be out of business. Who
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:01.200]   are your accounts receivable? Who are your suppliers? How do you stay in business? I don't
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.400]   care what your business is. Carbonite online backup for small business for individuals is the
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:11.360]   easiest way to go. It's one flat rate per year. It's as low as five bucks a month per computer,

[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:00.960]   two free months when you buy if you use our offer code to it. So go to carbonite.com offer code to
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:07.920]   it. Don't get bit by crypto locker and these other or fire flood and tsunami. There's lots of dangers
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:14.000]   out there. That crypto locker thing is giving me nightmares. Now, have you know, so in France,
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.960]   is it happening there? No, no, no, no, I mean, no one's really talking about it yet. See,
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:25.040]   that's that's what I mean. I heard about it on the Twig Network. And that's a piece of news I
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:31.440]   didn't really get anywhere else. So save those kinds of specialized publications. Steve Gibson
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:37.280]   talked about on security. Now this is a virus that's going around that, you know, there's lots
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.880]   of ransomware out there. But most of the time you can get around it used malware bytes or
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.200]   something and uninstall it. This one actually uses strong encryption to encrypt your data.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:52.240]   And once it's encrypted, I mean, it's strong encryption. Nobody can get it. They say you have 72
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:58.320]   hours to give us 300 bucks for the private key. They store that key on a unique server. They even
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:05.760]   give you a countdown timer. You watch your data disappearing. And if you don't pay in the 72 hours,
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:11.840]   they literally delete the key. And that's it. No one can get your data, not even the NSA
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.960]   can get your data back. They're using RSA 2048. I mean, it's strong encryption.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:25.040]   Very scary. Very scary. Real quickly, a couple of final. Has anybody,
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:32.560]   I'm maybe on Steve on this, this new AirGap BIOS virus. If he was followed this,
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:44.240]   there's a security researcher who's found a virus Mac or PC that can survive formatting the drive.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:53.760]   It's called, he calls it his name is a Dragos. Anybody anybody's name Dragos and is a security
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:58.160]   researcher, I think we're going to listen to him. He sounds like a boss, a villain.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:07.520]   It's another one of those nightmare things. The guy was apparently, he noticed some strange
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:12.880]   behavior on his PC and he couldn't find out where it came from. There was some weird,
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:20.560]   oops, sorry, weird activity on the network. And he kept reformatting his machine and it kept
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:26.240]   coming back. He didn't understand how it was going, how it was coming back. It was obviously a virus
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:36.400]   that rewrote the BIOS. And in the end, I think he managed to, by isolating the computer completely,
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:45.920]   he managed to identify the transmission method, which was partly, sorry, I'm not 100% sure on this,
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.800]   but it's partly the USB drive, which is pretty common from what I understand. So I'm not sure
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:59.840]   what the big deal is there. But there's also communication through the sound system.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:06.880]   Yeah, this is where I goes right off the rails. And he's going to explain this a week from now
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.320]   at a security conference. So maybe there's going to be a little bit more information on it.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:18.160]   This is not some, by the way, Dragos is not some weird guy out of nowhere. He organized
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:24.160]   Cansec West. He organized Pac West. He does the Pwn de Own competition every year.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:30.880]   He is absolutely a legitimate security researcher. He thinks the malware has the ability to use
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.320]   high frequency transmissions passed between computer speakers and microphones to jump
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.720]   air gaps. Air gaps means your computer is not connected to the network. It's standalone. He's
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:47.280]   had computers infected with brand new everything, brand new BIOS, brand new operating system,
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:52.080]   and they still get infected even though they're not connected to anything. And here's the scary
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:57.120]   thing. It's not just PCs, not just BIOS. It's also UEFI, the extensible firmware interface
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:03.440]   is used on Macintosh's as well. This and newer Windows machines. But we'll find out.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:11.600]   That's one to watch. When is he revealing it? Next week, I believe. I'm sorry. I'm not
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.600]   very, very, very interesting to hear about this. Kind of crazy, right?
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:24.080]   Creepy, huh? It sounds, it goes into the realm of it sounds fishy. We'll see.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:30.960]   A lot of people think it's very serious. The founder of Defcon and Black Hat tweeted,
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:38.320]   no joke. It's really serious. Everybody thinks that Dragos is very reliable. He's not, you know,
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:45.200]   he's not hysterical. Sure. If anyone else, you know, if someone that wasn't reliable, we'd have
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:48.720]   started talking about something like this. He would have been. Yeah, exactly. So.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:58.640]   The thing is, my guess is it's state sponsored. No, seriously. It's not the kind of thing, you
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:04.000]   know, somebody wants to hijack your machine for 300 bucks is going to do. There's plenty,
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.200]   there's plenty of low hanging fruit. You don't need to write software to send signals through
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:17.440]   the audio channels. But if your state sponsored and you know that Iran's nuclear enrichment program
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:26.400]   is air gapped, we remember Stuxnet did use USB keys. What do you do with the, with the,
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:33.040]   you know, speaker to microphone thing? Do you go get out the, the plant and get a get-o-blaster
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:41.360]   to, you know, maybe. Got John Cusack on that plant. Maybe. Very interesting.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:47.040]   All right. I think we can wrap this up. It's late enough. You've worked hard enough.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:51.760]   Patrick Bayjot's The Middle of the Night. One last, one last question. Maybe how much would you
[01:59:51.760 --> 02:00:00.320]   pay for a movie to get it the day it comes out on theater on your home TV? Our local,
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:07.120]   our local cable, or cable company Comcast is doing that on their on demand. And it's often
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:12.880]   10 to $20 to see same day as released in theaters. Here's my problem with it. The perception is
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:18.560]   that it's a crappy movie or they wouldn't be doing that. Yeah. The day somebody does it with the,
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:22.880]   you know, the next big movie, maybe. Well, that's what Netflix wants to do.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:30.320]   Oh, interesting. Yeah. So how much? How much are they asking? Yeah. They're, they're just talking
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.160]   about it now. What is the thing? So we're all going to go to see Andrew's game after this. I,
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.960]   I got a date to see Andrew's game. The tickets are $9 each, $9.50 each.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:45.760]   So for there's going to be five or six of us. So that's 54 bucks. If we could get it for 30 bucks
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.680]   and all sit around the TV and watch it, that's cheaper, right? Yeah. But you wouldn't have the
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.520]   popcorn, Leo, and that's definitely an important part of the experience. You have popcorn, but not
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:56.560]   the same popcorn. So for that, you can get the actual value.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:01.760]   Different experience. I mean, come on, it's going to be better. The home,
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:08.800]   ODB in the chatroom says the home popcorn market has not kept up. Popcorn technology. I don't know.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:13.360]   You get an Orville Redenbox. See, my daughter does not know how to cook popcorn. I was, she's 21.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.040]   And I said, we have Orville Redenbacher. I have a pot. I have oil. She's what,
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:24.080]   don't you have the, where's the packet that you put in the microwave? That's not popcorn.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.600]   That's horrible. Of course it is. Oh, it's horrible. Wait, that's not microwave popcorn. No,
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:35.280]   don't tell me you think that your French, you're from the land of flag. You're eating microwave popcorn.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:40.160]   Okay, Leo, wait a second. When we're start, if we want to start talking about food, we're not
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.040]   going to be talking about popcorn. Oh, no. Oh, no, we could be. It's a lifestyle blog now.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:53.040]   Oh, you're right. Instead, I could be shy. Charbacks brought me. Look at this. That's my Galaxy S4,
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:02:00.480]   right? That's an S3. Here's an OA Galaxy Note 3. Here's an iPhone 5s with a fingerprint reader.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:06.800]   It's in Gold 2, which is nice. And here is a Lumia 9. Actually, this is the 1020. It's got
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.680]   the little hump with a good camera. So that's what one, two, three, four, five phones total cost,
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.520]   $200 out the door. These are all Chinese knockoffs. And here's the amazing thing. This looks like an
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:24.480]   iPhone with iOS 7 and everything. That's Android running on it. Charbacks website is what's it again?
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:32.640]   Armed devices.net. Look at that is Android. That is not iOS 7. These are very popular in China.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:40.400]   This is not Windows phone. This is not your Nokia. This is Android. It even has the Windows logo on
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:48.560]   the bottom. And the tiles turn shenanigans. I call shenanigans. That's amazing. $4,399.
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:55.200]   That's that how much is that? I don't know. $36 for this. There you go. $36.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:57.440]   Can you slice a tomato with it?
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:08.320]   And on that note, I want to thank you so much. Tim Stevens and gadget editor. Can't wait to see
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:12.400]   that the car stuff. And I love it that you're doing feature stuff. That's really a great thing
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.280]   for you to be doing. Thanks so much. Yeah. I have a new weekly tech world.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.560]   Seen it. I'm sorry. Seen it. I thought I tried really hard to say it right this time.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.280]   Seen it. Go ahead. Thanks very much. What do you got? Something new? Something new?
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.200]   It's new. I have a new column that's going to be launching this week, kind of a weekly roundup
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.720]   in tech news with perspective. And I'm actually trying to get some ideas for names for the things.
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:36.480]   So if anybody in chat or if anybody on Twitter has some suggestions for what I should call the
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:41.840]   thing, I would love to hear your ideas. I think can you slice a tomato with that is pretty darn good.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:48.560]   But watch out, Tim. They're going to accuse you to have a lifestyle blog now.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:52.560]   No, no, no. I don't think they're a big problem. Never. Never.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:59.360]   Patrick Bejaw Patrick Bejaw.com B E J A.com
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.520]   is a new show is in French. So forget it.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:09.440]   Nice, Leo. Only Miriam could understand.
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.720]   That's okay. I'll tune in. No, it's a Patrick Bejaw.com.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.160]   Well, you know what? I spoke in way too much already during this show. So just follow me at
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:26.080]   not Patrick on Twitter and you'll have to see it all. He tweets all the time. Jab, jab, jab, hook.
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:33.280]   Exactly. I sent cheeseburgers and pies. And then I asked you if you've listened to my free podcast.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:40.960]   Exactly. Exactly. Miriam Jwari, love having you on in your kitchen. Look at this beautiful kitchen.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:46.720]   Are you a cook? So it's no, I'm not. But my spouse is a bit of a foodie. But you know what?
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:51.760]   It's your, but it's okay. I'll forgive you this time. I keep saying Jwari because I think it's
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:57.200]   so French to say Jwari. I know, but it's not. But you know what? Why don't you make it Jwari?
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:04.640]   It's in your power. I suppose I could add an accent. Exaltic you. Joyer. I think that's the
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:11.920]   joy. Joyer. So I'm supposed to say Jwari. Jwari. I'm sorry. Miriam Jwari. It's okay. Don't worry.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:16.320]   You know, my real name is Leo with an accent. I think you and the. I know it's Leo.
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:21.440]   Leo La Falt. Is it? You have like an actual French name with an accent. I do.
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:27.440]   That's right. And I don't know if I should say this, but when I came to San Francisco radio,
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:31.600]   because you know in radio, you're not supposed to use a ring. And my program director said no,
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:39.520]   he can't use Leo La Falt. It sounds gay. That's terrible. I know. Boy, was he wrong, by the way.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:45.360]   That would have been the best career move of all time. Exactly. So I changed it to Leo La Falt.
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:51.440]   Now I'm stuck with it 30 years later. Thank you, everybody. I was trying to say it sounds French.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:58.880]   He meant French. Sounds like peppy Le Pew. No, for a while, I called myself. This is embarrassing.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:08.880]   I call myself Leo La Falt, the DJ Francais. I hate to admit it. Thank you, everybody.
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:12.960]   We're joining us. Another twist.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:30.240]   Isn't the can. I have the hard way to do it.
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:33.240]   - All right. - Doing the twin, baby.
