[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.880]   is in Norway. I believe. Yeah, that's what he says. This day. I am ABC News Technology contributor
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.600]   @Beworley on Twitter and I'm joined by John C. Dvorak. Thankfully. What? We worked well together.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200]   Well, you came in to rescue me as my theory is when you're extremely-- They said Becky's going
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000]   to be doing the thing at Shabu for a woman. I said I better get in there.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.520]   John C. Dvorak from channeldvorak.com and also in studio with us, I as Actar.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.080]   I as a go. Ho host of what would you call it? The tech news today. Tech news today or--
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.920]   I call it tech news today. Today. Aunt Ma? Yeah, usually. You can always get it tomorrow.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.680]   This is a guy who is the real legal mind. I was illegal mind and that's been put aside.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   Now he's an illegal mind, but he'll be helping us to delve into the exciting oracle v. Google
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.360]   events of this week, which I think is quite possibly-- That would be interesting. Boring is
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.160]   helping. Did you go to the trial? I don't know. I've been wanting to go. Via Skype, we have Lance
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   Eulenoff from Mashable.com. Lance, thank you for giving us a portion of your Sunday evening.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.520]   You got the pass for an hour, right? That's right. We get you for an hour.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.960]   I can tell you the story behind this hour. That's a long story in and of itself.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.520]   Well, we're thankful that you can join us for at least portions of this. And while you're here,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.280]   John C. Dvorak will be sure to abuse you. What's this thing with his hour?
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.560]   He will only get him for an hour. What? Have an hour. That's it. I don't know. You only get the
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.360]   pass for an hour. We don't know. It is the weekend. He's got some sort of social event.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.600]   And so in case we do have plenty of minds here, also joined by Dan Patterson, formally a colleague
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.720]   of mine at ABC News Radio, and now at Co-Studio, Co-Point. Thank you for joining us, Dan. We like
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.600]   your security cam that you've got going there. Yeah, right. You got to wait while we install the
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.240]   HD cameras in our own little studio here. It'll just be fun to watch for people walking through the
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.280]   back of the shot. It's going to be exciting. I sense that already. We are startup and we have
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.560]   plenty of people here. Yeah. I used to be Leo's producer at Texas. Yeah, a lot of people don't
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.280]   realize it, but you used to be Leo's producer at Tech TV. Yes. And so I was racking my brain when
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   Leo's new producer Eileen said to me, "Will you come post to it?" You know, and I think, "Oh, I'm
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.160]   going to produce it." So I have a vehicle for us to get into this weekend. Why would you want to
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.600]   produce and be the host? No, just have an idea to keep it organized, keep it flowing so people won't
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.960]   notice that Leo's not here. Oh, they've noticed already. They have. They have. Either that or they
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.800]   think that he came back from, you know, actually, their operation. He was actually went to Holland.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Here he is, ladies and gentlemen. This is Leo the port. Yes. I'm fond of him. I'm a chick.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.360]   So it was sort of an earnings o'rama this week. And while I'm not really interested in the earnings
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.960]   for the numbers, it's not like we're advising anyone on what stock to buy. I think you've learned
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.680]   a lot because they, companies have to tell the truth. This is not marketing. This is how you're
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.320]   going to start the show? Yes. Okay. Okay. So now the abuse of Apple. Huge numbers. Did you see the
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.520]   front page of today's Sunday New York Times? No. Holy mackerel. They had this big story. There's a
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.240]   big blowout story about how Apple's not paying enough taxes. Oh, yeah. And this guy's going for
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.000]   Pulitzer with this thing. But the thing that's weird about they took the entire front page and
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   they ran a graph up the left hand side. Unfortunately, you have to look at the paper to see this. And
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   it took up the whole thing. It makes the paper look really thin and narrow. It's like a complete,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.520]   I thought it was a design nightmare, a disaster. So well, but there by the time just giving it to
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.160]   them, really turned on Apple. Well, money offshore, right? Don't they have a ton of their money offshore?
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.240]   Well, the thing that every time they do every time they do their earnings, they talk about cash
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.720]   and they say like 79 billion of it is offshore. Well, all I know is that this operation they set
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.200]   up is in Nevada. So they don't pay California taxes on all this. In other words, the $110 billion
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   is being run through the investment operation in Nevada. And this is what's a big scandal. Now,
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.040]   somebody in the chat room just said it's not that big of a deal. And I'm kind of the same way. If
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.680]   I was Apple and I could hide all my money somehow without having to pay all these extra taxes,
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.320]   I think I have to do this for the shareholders.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.760]   Well, I mean, just when you think about the pure scope of the money that they're bringing,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:51.520]   and they announced $39 billion in revenue. This is for quarter Q1, which is when traditionally
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.400]   hardware consumer electronics not selling down. Yeah, they're way down. Yeah, normally.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.280]   This is 59% growth over same quarter last year. Here's the thing that blew me out of the water.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:09.680]   $11.6 billion in profit. Google's total revenue, 10.7 billion. So they're profiting more than Google's
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.640]   making total revenue. Google has no real hardware to sell, right? Well, and that's the thing is that
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.360]   when you're a service company, you're not going to be. I got the phone.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.160]   Yeah, even if you have a phone on a phone, I got a phone says Google, I know somebody's selling
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.000]   it. A bunch of phones say good, but that's a licensing thing. They're not making, I mean,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.720]   it's not like Apple where they're selling, they are actually selling the hardware and making a profit
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.040]   off of the hardware. No, this is true. It's not the same, but it was Google who sent me the phone.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.520]   What I'm just curious about is when does public opinion start to shift on Apple?
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.840]   I think our warm and fuzzies are still net positive with them right now, but at some point,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.600]   Steve is going to be a memory and only that, a memory. And at what point do numbers like this,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.960]   and whether it's legal or ethical or some weird gray area will start to matter less,
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   and public opinion will really move in and shift the direction of the company. When does that
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.920]   happen? 18 months, 36 months, five years? It's not about public opinion. It's about the product.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.040]   It's always going to be, I think for Apple, somebody asked, when does Apple start to fall?
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.160]   They asked me that question. I said, when they start to deliver bad products,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.880]   thus far they haven't done that. I think one point, I think you're right, that
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:40.800]   when the Steve era truly ends, meaning that his influence over future product ends in, say, 18
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.480]   months, then I think you have a bigger question because it's going to be, what is the end product?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.320]   What are they delivering? Is it still as good? Is it still as magical?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.640]   That's what I'm driving at, though, that we can take the bubble in the aura of Steve Jobs only so
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.760]   far. When do we start going, well, this product just stinks and no amount of Steve Magic can sway
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.040]   that? Well, I think the other thing, there was a great story in adage this week about Apple's
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.120]   first misstep post jobs may be exactly around this public opinion sentiment. It was the Samuel
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.640]   Jackson, Zoe Deschanel ads for Siri. Did you see these? Yeah, sorry, I saw it.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:29.280]   Where he's asking Siri, where do I find organic mushrooms? Where do I, you know, Samuel Jackson
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.760]   doesn't get enough work. Don't you expect them to start yelling at some point, Siri,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.360]   just like, like screaming like, what does Marcelis Wallace look like or any of this stuff?
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:45.840]   There's a great episode of South Park a couple years ago about smug and smug rising from Silicon
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.800]   Valley. And they used the Prius as their product example that all the Prius owners,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.760]   the smug was rising from the Valley. Now, you can replace the Prius in that humorous South Park
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.000]   example with iPhone or I, whatever. And I think things like the Zoe Deschanel ad will just contribute
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.520]   to it. People go, oh, this is just too much cute, man. And it is. It does also go back to the money.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.240]   I mean, the money is unbelievable. And I think this happened to Microsoft when they just got so
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.200]   huge. And you can't ignore that unemployment is still near 9%. And when you have rich movie stars
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.640]   talking about organic mushrooms in an apple ad, I mean, that could still with earnings like this,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.160]   it could spell bad things for them. Is Apple is obligating this connect, is Apple is Apple
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.080]   disconnected from the people in the real world? I think that's a fair question. But you know,
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.240]   I really believe the reason that we started to see these series ads is because something I started
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.720]   to wonder myself had people forgotten about Siri is Siri. I wanted to write something called
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.480]   a series lonely because after the initial sort of excitement about Siri and all the games we were
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.000]   playing with her, I started to notice I didn't see people using it anymore. And people stopped
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.400]   talking about it. And there were fewer articles about it. So Apple needs to remind people, hey,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.520]   we put this poor woman inside your phone. Don't forget about her. Well, and if this was the one
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.200]   marketing ploy that they had for the 4s, you know, I agree with you. It seems like Siri has kind of
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:16.800]   fallen off the radar. But then you look at the numbers for the phones, 35.1 million iPhones sold
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.720]   in Q1. The iPhone 4s is like an old man who's stumbling around waiting to be replaced by the
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.480]   iPhone 5 or the new iPhone or the next iPhone. And they're still selling an insane amount of
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:36.160]   phones. That's twice what they sold in Q1 2011. Yeah, they're kicking ass. And then the other thing
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.480]   that blew me out of the water was the China numbers. It used to be 2% of their overall revenue.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.000]   Now 20%. We just got on board with I think China Telecom. They're not even on the number one Chinese
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.840]   mobile carrier yet. And they're selling tons of phones because even the like I think the third
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.000]   largest has like millions and millions of subscribers. The thing about about Apple's phone, which I
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.160]   think is surprising. Every time we take a look at mobile carriers numbers, their revenue numbers,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.000]   they always go, Oh, our numbers are up because we had the iPhone and the data prices are up
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.560]   because AT&T had a good quarter for this. Verizon had a good quarter because they had a lot more money
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.160]   because people wanted to pay a lot more for data. And I think a lot of it's just due with the
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.080]   even though these ads are a bit disconnected, I think Apple's always been disconnected. They're
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.400]   not a focus group team thing. They're like, we're going to tell you what it looks like. This is
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.280]   what you're going to watch. This is what you're going to like. Yeah. Well, here's the problem is
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.200]   Steve always had a good second sense about these things. That's why he had those crazy ads with
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.880]   John Hodgman and the other guy. And all the ads they had before then, the Ellen Fice, I think is
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.640]   the my all time favorite, the girl who's had the doggy at the paper. Anyway, this idea is a complete
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:49.200]   vile. You know, the one basic rule of marketing is you do not start marketing stuff that's not hot.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   So if something goes off, you know, it kind of falls off the table, you don't say, well, geez,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.760]   if we just put some more money behind it, that might do well, they should you always take the
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.160]   money and you push it toward the thing that's selling well. And I think the decision to start
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.360]   to promote, re-promote Siri, I think maybe the chink in the armor, we might start beginning to
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.760]   witness that we'll start to show up more and more where they're making mistakes. This is basically,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.000]   this is like a Microsoft ad. It's a complete waste of money. Microsoft puts more money behind
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.440]   ads that don't work than any company ever. No money to waste. But there's a carrier partner,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.720]   isn't there a carrier partner on this commercial that it's not just Apple?
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.880]   No, good. Two people get to lose out. I just thought that was because I wonder if it's getting
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.760]   pushed a little bit from there. I was going to ask though, you know, that I do wonder a little bit
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   if the iPad new with the retina display is a little bit of a problem for Apple in that
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.520]   the retina displays the only new thing about it really that matters. And there isn't a lot to do
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.960]   with it. Well, 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter compared to 4.7 million a year ago.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.400]   Well, they're going to sell. I mean, look, they put out something new. They're absolutely going to
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.040]   sell it. But the question I'm asking is, you know, because I think the iPad still remains the best
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.760]   tablet on the market. But my question is, is this a fundamentally better tablet than the one before?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.040]   They're simply still filling the market that they have. And, you know, maybe people are realizing
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.200]   this is just as good as the other one, but not particularly that different.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.160]   I think that presupposes a relativity in the purchasing that one of the things I read this
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.400]   week is that a rising number of people, their first Apple product is an iPad. It's not an iPhone.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.960]   It's not an iPod. It's that the iPad is the device that they're bringing into transition into
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:45.440]   a tablet mobile based world. So I don't know. I think we make the presupposition that people
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.520]   are choosing between many iterations or between many different products. But really, a lot of people,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   this is their first foray. And if they're getting the iPad three as their first Apple product,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.640]   they're loving it. They don't know that it's only a slight iterative advancement from the iPad 2.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.440]   Agree? What's fair? I guess.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:10.320]   Not a lot of work to get there. And so, Professor Devore, you believe that that assertion gets me
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.480]   an A? I think you should get an A plus. All right. I'm going to take that.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:21.040]   Well, what you've said in a long roundabout way was that the market's not saturated.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.440]   And these new newbies that started filling the... We haven't seen what happens when the market
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.960]   gets saturated with these products. Then what will Apple do? 1100 to share.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.600]   You know, it wouldn't surprise me if it got to that, actually. Yeah, it's not. But at this point,
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.280]   it's been nuts. I think it's going to be one of the greatest shorts in the history of the stock market.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.680]   At some point... You'd have to have a pair to go with that now. Oh, yeah.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:52.480]   You would have a pair for long. The WWDC, the Worldwide Developers Conference,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:58.800]   is June 11th at Moscone Center. Is this the Google one? No, the Apple one. Yeah.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   And they put the tickets on sale at 5.30 a.m. Pacific, only 1,600 tickets.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.200]   There was sold out, it went in five minutes. Two hours. Oh, it took that long.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.040]   So all the East Coasters will be coming over and all the West Coasters will be SOL?
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.080]   Pretty much. They charge, what, 1600 bucks a ticket. You couldn't buy multiple tickets, I think.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.840]   And they were canceling certain company's orders because they were paid by one credit card.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.320]   So people who are in that situation have to contact Apple to get their tickets back,
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.320]   because they're not re-issuing them unless you say something. So I don't know how people are
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.760]   going to get in in the first place. I mean, but hopefully people will go in and be like,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.040]   "Oh, wow, iOS and OS 10 will be there." And I don't know what else to put it.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.880]   Why didn't they get just over that? You could have probably made it.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.040]   Moscone holds a lot of people. There's no... And there's one auditorium down in the lower part
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.080]   that is if you open up all the walls, because I've seen Oracle uses it. You could put it in like
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.520]   three, four, thought. Why didn't they just bring in 5,000 people at that price and really go for it?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.960]   What was the reason for having a cutoff when there's such a demand?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.120]   Makes no sense to make sure that it's not able to do things.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.800]   It's maybe a tax tax. Apple likes to sort of control these situations. I mean, it wants to make
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:18.880]   it like this really special thing. And they succeed. Maybe they'll open up some more seats later.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.800]   They'll do something special and keep the interest high and the high-py. This is just... It's their
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:32.080]   playbook. A little bit more on the iPhone. Just keeping with the Apple theme. Half of all Verizon
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:39.520]   smartphone activations in Q1 were iPhones. 78% of all smartphone activations on AT&T were iPhones.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.680]   And Sprint posts an $863 million loss.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:50.080]   Who's poor guys? Yeah. Sprint gonna make it? Not gonna make it?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.400]   They'll make it. I mean, the way they're doing wholesale stuff with their network,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.920]   instead of just going with... I mean, obviously you want to get consumers, you want to get the
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.880]   actual people to buy your phone each time. And they have the iPhone, they went ahead with that.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   And they're moving to LTE. But the fact that they're wholesaling their network to other companies,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.720]   and they run a lot of stuff, they figured out with YMAX, what are they going to do with that?
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.400]   They're letting their other subsidiaries use it. I think it's a boost and virgin will be using
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.800]   the YMAX thing while that's being phased out. So it's just kind of at least gets some money out
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.640]   of the old technology you have sitting around. They seem to be at least aggressive enough that
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.720]   they're making moves because you watch T-Mobile and they're like, "Look, we changed our spokes
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.200]   models dress and now she's wearing leather." So that's going to save the company and they keep
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.240]   asking for the iPhone. They can't get it because Apple won't put in that band in that phone.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.680]   So I mean, Sprint, I think, is at least trying. They're not like... I think
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.920]   I'm probably on the death watch, it's T-Mobile. That's what I'm looking at.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.680]   Nokia shares just downgraded to junk basically after their earnings and Samsung now, number one
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.360]   maker of phones. Are you trying to... Are you working on your portfolio as a computer? No!
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.440]   They're doing a nice job, thanks. I think it's their death. How much money are they paying you at ABC?
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.400]   I slap your hand. No, I just think it's... I think earnings are cool because you get an insight
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.720]   into things that normally are sort of hidden or obfuscated or not clearly addressed. Obfuscated.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.000]   And on the blonde, I get to use polysyllabic words. Polysyllabic.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.200]   Nice topic. Thank you.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:30.320]   Yeah, no, I think the fact that Samsung now is overtaken, Nokia after 14 years,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.280]   Nokia holding the reins as number one maker. Well, let's go and do the worldwide.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.200]   That's just face reality. They were posed the minute they went with this Microsoft strategy
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.880]   and it was a foregone conclusion. If Nokia goes down to two bucks or
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.640]   two bucks, 50 or something, it's not going to surprise me. I think they were hosed a lot.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.680]   They were getting hosed, but they could have survived if they'd gone immediately with the
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:00.720]   Android. I mean, that may be part of the problem that they were hosed institutionally a long
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.280]   time ago. When iPhone was introduced, it was the death of Nokia because institutionally,
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.840]   they were not prepared to adjust to a marketplace that did adjust incredibly fast.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.680]   Nokia is a ready for it. They put out junk products that over, you know,
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.320]   wait, the products are actually quite nice in terms of the hardware.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.080]   You're right about that. Some of their products are very nice. Some of their products are not
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.040]   very nice. And I think they were just institutionally not ready for a chain. So no matter what,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.640]   they were going to roll over and die. Well, that's fine and dandy, but don't you think
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.080]   it's a little different than buying a, you know, it's like having a being on death's door step,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.880]   but then buying a shotgun and shooting yourself. I do agree with that. The Microsoft thing was
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.920]   exactly that. I think that I was going to just say that, you know, with Nokia, they were the
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.840]   leader in feature phones. And I think that position put them at risk because as the rise of the
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.000]   smartphones happened, they just didn't seem prepared to make the change and they were doing far too
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.080]   well for too long. And I guess that's what made them, you know, sort of put them at greater risk
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.720]   than everyone else because they really were so baked into that market. And they're still selling.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.320]   I mean, they're still selling these Symbian phones in other parts of the world. But what we're
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.520]   watching right now is Nokia attempting to rebuild. And, you know, I don't think it's found its bottom
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.720]   yet. You know, Microsoft phones are taking off, Windows phones are taking off slowly,
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.400]   but it's a long race. If they can stick with it, I think they have the money. I think they have the
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.160]   time. I don't think it's a bad idea that they've really hitched their wagon to Windows phones.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.080]   I think that it's a good platform. Just a question of if they can accelerate and get back on track.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.200]   I think that's completely wrong. I talked to my thing that Microsoft operating system is terrible.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.120]   Oh, I don't think so. I think you're wrong. I talked to why. Have you ever tried to move a
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.680]   file off of it? You got to take and download Zune software to do it. It's a Zune phone.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:03.120]   I don't look Zune. So it's another ecosystem. There are parts of that ecosystem that I like
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.080]   quite a bit. I think that it does a good job. I mean, basically you're signing in with your
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.400]   one, your Windows Live or Hotmail account, whatever you want to use. The integration seems quite smooth.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.000]   I don't spend a lot of time trying to move files off of it. I could use SkyDrive if I want to.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I can put the file up there. What phone do you use, Lance? What kind of phone? What do you use?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.560]   I had the HTC Focus. I think it's the Focus.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.040]   Yes, it runs the other ones. What's that?
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.920]   Is it running Windows? The Windows phone? Yeah, I'm talking about Windows.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.760]   No, I'm saying is that HTC Focus that you use? Is that a Windows?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.400]   I mean, you're using the Windows phone on a day-to-day basis, what I'm asking.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.920]   I've used it. I'm not using it. That's all I need to know.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.560]   I have used it. I have used it. But I have used it on a day-to-day basis.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.680]   And what was the number one most unusable thing?
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.200]   You can't move files on and off the thing. It's extremely clunky. The hardware is quite nice.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.040]   It feels great. It's a great phone. It can call and receive calls.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:13.680]   But for the most part, it is not viable in this market compared to Android. Android just
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   is so much better. You try to move your phone. Why are you always trying to move files off your
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.880]   phone? I take pictures. I take photos with my phone. Who doesn't take photos with their phone?
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.760]   Do I have to go through Zoom to move the photo off? Why don't I just plug the thing straight into
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.680]   the computer, look at it as a file and move it off? Is that so hard?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.880]   Well, when I'm using my iPhone, I'm not trying to move files off of it. I'm sending them places.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.640]   I'm posting them on Twitter. Yeah, great. I don't use an iPhone either.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.440]   Dan, you and Gina Smith this week talked to was about the Windows phone, right?
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.120]   He loved it. He was also eating burgers over lunch.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:02.160]   I tried to move a file off him, sure. I think that that's exactly it. He did emphasize that it
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.200]   was the front end that he liked. I asked him specifically if there was something deep in the phone,
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.240]   him being a tinkerer, I figure he may want to really be in love with something deep within the
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.560]   phone. He emphatically said, "No, there is nothing deep within the phone that I find
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.480]   compelling," but he did love the interface. Give or take, I guess.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:31.200]   You've heard my opinion. I think we'd all like to know, everyone to know that John says,
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.760]   "You can't move files off the phone." You can if you want to make it a Zoom phone,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.400]   load the Zoom interface, which is horrible, by the way. If the Zoom interface was cool,
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.240]   like better than Windows or whatever you're using, then I'd say, "Well, great. I think everything
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:50.720]   should go Zoom," but it's not. It's a piece of, it's really an old-fashioned style of,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.200]   like, "Let's take iTunes and copy it and find some way to make it worse."
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.400]   They just took the Arco's Jukebox software and just put it right on there.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.040]   That's where Nokia could have made a difference. They had the ability to alter Windows phone
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.320]   because they're the partner. They could have made other software so you don't have to do the Zoom
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.040]   desktop. They could have done something to make their phone experience a lot different because
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.480]   right now it's all the same. Windows phone, HTC, Samsung, Nokia. It's the same freaking experience.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.320]   Let's do what we did with Android. Let's fork it. That's a great idea.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.560]   But they're the hardware partner. They're supposed to be able to have it working well and they didn't do that.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:30.080]   I hear a lot of people like you Lance groaning about the forking of the Android phone. It's not
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.200]   really forking. Some of them just don't get upgraded. But I don't, I mean, there's guys like you
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.800]   that complain about it. I've had a couple different Android phones and I don't care.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.440]   I can still download all the free apps I want and do whatever I have to do. I don't find it to be
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.880]   horrible that not every Android phone is exactly the same as the other.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.120]   And I don't like all the different overlays. And I also, I'm not a huge fan of the Android
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.320]   interface itself. I would say ice cream sandwich better, much better in a lot of ways.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.720]   But when you're an iPhone user it's pretty obvious.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.560]   Yeah. I want to. Do you remember a few years ago,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:09.040]   Fred Wilson in referring to Twitter and the whole, the uprising or the new social media space that
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.840]   had had arisen around Facebook and Twitter, he said, look, this space is here and the potholes
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.080]   have been filled. We're good. We're cool. And I kind of wonder if we're there with the new,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.920]   with the mobile space as well. Are the potholes filled? Are we, we, all the room for innovation
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.640]   has occurred. We've had major innovation. Now it's time for minor refinements. And I wonder if
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.040]   that kind of speaks to John's point about, you know, the interface can be beautiful, but it really
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.400]   matters what's under the hood. Well, I think you're getting to the point where you're making a
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.600]   decision between ecosystems, not between hardware, not between operating systems. And this goes to
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.160]   John's point where when Microsoft can integrate this into something that's not called zoom,
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.440]   and is more skydrive oriented, I think then it's going to be a more elegant interface.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.320]   And were it you like skydrive and Becky? But I think that it has, it has a value play.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   Certainly people are looking at it as the best value option right now compared to all the other
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.840]   options for cloud storage. We'll get to that in a little bit. But I'm just saying when you look at
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:12.880]   a $99 smartphone and you're trying to pick something that's, you don't really think it's going to be
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.440]   the bottom line. This is kind of a tangent, but it's when the data data plans start to be tiered in
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.600]   the same way that the hardware is tiered right now. I actually don't think it's as much about
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.360]   ecosystems as it is about a consumer play where the reason why the barrier to entry for people
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.640]   right now on smartphones is not hardware. It's not, oh, operating system. It's that the data plans
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.840]   are too expensive. And until that changes, I don't think it matters. That's what I think is the
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.720]   biggest process. There's also some social issues involved here. You can bring out a, for example,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.520]   and I've had this happen, the Windows Phone 7 into a crowd of people that are all, you know,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:53.200]   either iPhone users or mixed and they laugh at it. Now, this is not the kind of phone you want to
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.280]   try to pick up girls with. I'll put it that way. Well, can't pick up girls with tiles.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   It's kind of the place to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:06.320]   Metro, which is that this is about functionality, not necessarily specs, right? That's the whole
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.960]   thing that they've been pushing for years is that this is about how this performs and, and not
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   necessarily what, what, you know, if we can put on a chart and, and graph out of this. And when it
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.240]   comes down to performance, part of performance is like, can I afford this? Can I afford to buy in?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:29.920]   And, and I'm going to use that as a segue into the next story, which is Amazon and the Kindle Fire
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:38.240]   taking number two spot in tablets. 56% of all Android based tablets are Kindle fires.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:49.200]   The tab 15% of Android tablets. I'm pretty amazed at the speed at which the Kindle Fire has taken
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.760]   off. And I think it's purely a price play. I don't know. It's just the price. And distribution.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:01.040]   They have very, yeah. Do you notice, by the way, it's a comm score report and comm score left out.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.880]   I mean, they didn't actually even consider it, which I find very interesting, the Bonginoble Nook
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.320]   tablet. They consider that a reader, even though it is fundamentally the same, it even runs the
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   same version of Android as the Kindle Fire and has the nearest thing to sort of ecosystem that
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.480]   Amazon's has. There are some caveats there, but they didn't even look. So I'm a little, I kind of
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.960]   look sideways at these numbers. Yeah, I agree with the ones on this one. Often doesn't get it right.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.080]   Well, and the other stat that came around around this is that the, the seven inch tablets
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.320]   have much less media consumption than the 10 inch tablets. And I think that's, it's hard to know
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.600]   chicken and egg on this. Is that because the tablets smaller, the screen is smaller, therefore,
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.560]   people don't enjoy consuming media as much. Or if you get a smaller tablet, fundamentally,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.640]   you're just using it as a reader, which is smaller consumption anyways of, of media.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.440]   I think the study for that number was actually looking at browser pages. I mean,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.200]   times you look through a page. And I know with the seven inch readers, at least something like a
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.280]   Kindle, the resolution isn't high enough. So you still have to like pinch and zoom. You might as
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.600]   well be using the phone at that point. But the 10 inch tablets, at least you can see it all in one
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.200]   pass and you can like maybe that they'll make it click. Do you have a seven inch Kindle?
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.520]   I've used this seven inch Kindle. I've used one. Most people don't have any problem reading on
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.800]   those things. Well, I mean, for the web pages, that all not all yet for web pages. That's
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.560]   where I'm at for a book. Oh, yeah, for a book reading. It's great. But the study was looking
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.480]   for media consumption. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. The browser part. Yeah, the way it's not, it falls
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:33.040]   apart. But yeah, both of those. Well, those are Android 2.3 devices. And when I tested both of them,
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.400]   I found with Kindle Fire that a lot of the interface stuff and web pages by default almost
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.120]   ended up too small and unreached. So you don't have a great resolution. Everything's kind of small.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.200]   And you have to, you know, as I said, sort of this pinch and zoom stuff, which is really,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.880]   you know, not what you want. If you use your iPad, obviously, you're just looking at web pages.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.440]   You're rarely doing that. Everything's kind of sized, right?
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.920]   Yeah. No, I'm in total agreement for normal pad use use. In fact, using the Kindle,
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:05.600]   the newer ones with the connectivity, you can go to a web page and get emergency email for free
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.440]   for the rest of your life with you have the right Kindle. But it's pretty crappy as a, as an experience.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:18.080]   And I mean, just going back to this on Amazon, they are, you know, crushing it in their earnings,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.800]   but not so much because of kindles. I mean, they're not, they're just subsidized dramatically.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.240]   It's really just digital consumption is up for them. So they are fundamentally
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.280]   going along with them.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.520]   Do you remember, do you remember, it's a long time ago, and I remember it was,
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.200]   we had just had that show on tech TV called Money Machine. Oh, vaguely.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.480]   And the hosts had, wasn't that carmines? Yeah. And that gal, I can't remember.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.520]   She had hair like a lampshade, but I can't remember. It was a Mrs. Newt Gingrich.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.680]   No, I'm sorry. I think it's someone else. But I remember you'd said that they disclosed that they
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.360]   like lost a ton of money after the tech bubble broke. And you would said,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.960]   "There should never be on television again." And this was second like, you know, after the bubble broke.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.560]   I don't recall saying that, but okay. I probably said it. At that point, I decided I was,
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:11.600]   if I was going to attempt to be on television, I wasn't going to make my name on financials and
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.360]   investing. So no, John. You're always, okay. Although I had to say Amazon is amazing.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.640]   One more company though, who's earning. I think they're fascinating. Nintendo.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:30.240]   Hanking. It's their first, well, that's a little bit aggressive. What is relatively interesting is
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.920]   they're posting their first loss since they went public. They were expected to sell more than 15
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:44.880]   million wheeze. They sold less than 10 million. 3DS sales, not good. Anybody have high hopes for
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.080]   Wii U think they're going to pull it out because they're going to be the only ones with the new
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.920]   console at holiday 2012? I do. I have nothing but the most confidence. Of all the companies,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.480]   I know, I think Nintendo is the one that comes out of this. They've done this before. Do you remember
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.280]   when they first came out with the PS3 or the PS2 or whatever it was when it was an HD and then
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.520]   Microsoft had one of their products? And it was, oh, the Wii is a loser. It was going to be just
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.080]   in the tank. It was never going to know what it was going to buy it. They're coming to us out of
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:18.160]   business. And that was in like 99. And so here they are again, same 10-year cycle. There got some
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.440]   problems. I predicted Nintendo will come out of this fine mainly because of this happened and
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.960]   happened and happened. They're slow. I mean, how long do they ride on the Wii crest? I mean,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:35.680]   they should have come out with an HD version. They did not. They've got their butts handed to
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.640]   them by Microsoft and the Kinect and so did Sony. I mean, Sony said, yeah, we'll still do
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:46.240]   it. Sony should be talking about it in the same sense. But basically, I don't know that Wii U is
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.800]   going to-- Wii U is a tablet sort of interface and an augmented reality experience for the Wii,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:59.040]   but it doesn't fundamentally change the Wii. And it feels gimmicky. I agree with you, Lantique.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.920]   I mean, I played with it at CES. And the only thing that was interesting was the golf game where,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:10.320]   you know, it has a simulated golf ball down low and then you use the Wii controller and you hit the ball.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.640]   Off the similar-- and don't call it a tablet. Whatever you do, don't call it a tablet. But
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:21.520]   I just don't think it's going to be innovative enough to move the needle for Nintendo alone,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.800]   unless they have something really big up their sleeve. I just don't get it.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.000]   I'm not saying that you guys are wrong in any way. I'm just saying that I have faith that Nintendo
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.080]   can pull the rabbit out of the hat. When I come out of the rabbit. Yeah.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.760]   I don't want to live in a world without Nintendo. Of course not.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.520]   One of the big reasons-- It's such an iconic brand. I mean, shortly this is a company that can
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.760]   figure out how to reinvent themselves. They've done it three times before. They'll figure it out
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:54.640]   again. They may ditch Wii U. They'll go small and mobile and forget the 3D. But Nintendo will
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.400]   figure it out. It sounds like the hopes of Tinkerbell. Yeah, let's all clap. Yeah, okay. Thanks Lance.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.120]   Very good observation. You got it. You killed us. Their financial problem was they were
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.520]   selling lots of 3DSs at a loss. So it doesn't matter how many of these things you sell, even if
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.920]   they did really well, that would hurt them. And the thing is, the Wii internally is the GameCube.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.000]   So they're always making money on the hardware. So if they're making the Wii U and they're up in
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.160]   the resolution and they actually get inside of homes, they're making money on the hardware the
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.800]   way they're supposed to be. Their software sales is just crap nowadays. They need to move and
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:32.960]   realize, look, you cannot bank on a handheld portable gaming system alone because that used to be
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.040]   the bread and butter. This is the thing that's going away. It's like the PDA of the MP3 player.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.120]   This thing cannot survive. Even Sony put in, I think, 3G and their Vita. You have to have something
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.720]   else in the mobile space. And maybe that means putting out games for iOS, Android.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:55.920]   How about this? They deal with Apple and the iOS becomes a massive joint venture with Nintendo
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.720]   and you're playing the games on that thing. That's where the action is.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   But is there any margin compared to what they're used to? If you're working with Apple,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.640]   there's always margin and plenty of it. People are making money. I think it's a fantastic idea.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.600]   And obviously, the 3DS, again, another gimmick, 3D. You can see everything in 3D. I don't think
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.720]   people care that much about 3D. Nobody agree with that. And it did not work. I saw during last
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:29.200]   holiday season, they had stationed people at various retail outlets to cost you and show you
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.000]   the 3DS and how wonderful it is. I'm like, look, I've seen it. Go away. Stop standing so close to me.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.480]   Sure. That's what they're really up to, Lance.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:45.120]   Well, you know, they'll be on one. So, I mean, really, fundamentally, we play mobile games on our
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.240]   phones. What are parents handling their kids to play games on? The iPhones and the iPads.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.800]   The era of the standalone play games on handheld only device, game only device, they're done.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.680]   Absolutely done. I agree. All right. We're going to take this opportunity. First of all,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.920]   I just want to say we had earnings O'Rama here for the first time on Twitch. It is.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:13.440]   Leo would never do that. I know. Don't tell him. Nobody. Believe me, I won't be telling anybody.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.400]   But he's going to make us some money right now. We're going to take a quick break. And when we
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.720]   come back, we're going to talk about all things Google and sort of the intrigue, the excitement
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.080]   of the trial. So, wait a minute. So, they're going to do a Leo cut in here and they didn't
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:32.400]   trust you to read the ads? You know, she's got good hair, but the bitch can't sell.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.320]   That was he's sad. I'm going to squeak that out.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.200]   Let me baby see how. On that note, Uncle Leo.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:49.680]   Thank you, Becky. And we'll be back with a great panel and more great twit action coming up.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.760]   It's a gauge match coming up in just a little bit. But first, I wanted to tell you a little bit
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.320]   about Ford and they make me do this because I'm the guy who drives a Ford and loves it. It's my
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.960]   2010 Ford Mustang with Ford sinking. You've heard me talk about it this all the time. I mean,
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.880]   sink is the whole idea of sink is that you control the car with your voice music, songs,
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:15.920]   destinations, even things like gas prices, movie times, horoscopes, all by without taking your
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.840]   hands off the wheel or taking your eyes off the road. And that means you're connected,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.400]   but you're connected safely. It really solves the driver distraction problem. That's a big
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.480]   problem and growing all the time. In fact, you know, I could promise you when my kids get their
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.800]   cars, they're going to have forts because I want them to keep their hands on the wheels.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   Actually, my son says not 10 and 2 dad. The new thing is 9 and 3 or 8 and 4.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:46.000]   Kids today. Anyway, at least I'll have a Ford sink. So hands on the wheel, eyes on the road,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.800]   and then you press the button on the steering wheel or sometimes it's on the blinker. And the
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.520]   car basically says, what do you want? Now, here's a neat thing. They've got this new thing called
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:01.920]   app link that is an API for Ford sink. You'll find it in most of Ford 2012 and 2013 Ford vehicles.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.080]   App link means that an app developer can write his app or her app to go with
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.280]   sinks to be controlled by voice. See, when you get, you know, in your car, you connect all Ford
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   sink vehicles have a USB port. I like that. So you connect in your phone, Android iPhone,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.720]   Windows phone that way or via Bluetooth. And now you can talk to the phone. Pandora is in a good
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.560]   example. It supports Pandora. So you can say, play this station or that. You can say,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.360]   thumbs up to that song, that kind of thing. They've also got NPR has an app now. So you can listen
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.560]   to breaking news and play your favorite NPR programs, iHeartRadio's Thumb Play service is
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.960]   supported. That means you can say, play KFI or whatever station you want. There's stations,
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   hundreds of them all over the country, as well as the kind of the artist radio now,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.000]   the Pandora style artist radio. That means they even support things like thumbs up, thumbs down,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.080]   skip to the next song. All of this without taking your hands off the wheel, you don't pick up your
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.720]   phone, you don't look down at the screen, you don't twiddle knobs. Open beak will read you
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.880]   tweet, stitcher, Slack or radio will let you listen to podcasts and radio shows. There's even a
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.120]   sink destinations. So if you didn't get the big screen in your car, and by the way, that's one
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.960]   way you can save money on sink. They don't, it's turn by turn directions by voice. You don't have
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.800]   to have that big GPS screen. Or if you've got a smartphone and sink destinations, you can use the
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.560]   maps and the turn by turn directions from the phone. I mean, this is really clever. If you
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:32.240]   developer, check out Ford's Sink's mobile application developer network for help from Ford and how
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.680]   to get your app worked with Sink. There's lots more to come. If you're a driver, a user, go to your
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.640]   Ford dealer, please just say, I want to try out App Link. I've got my smartphone and they'll get
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.960]   you in the right car to test it out. They'll set it up for you. You can also go to the website
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:53.440]   Ford.com/technology to learn more. But enough about that. Let's get back to the gang.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.480]   A great twit going on. Becky Worley, take it away.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.520]   Thank you. Have a question for Leo.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:08.400]   I said I can sell, but I do drive that forward and I do love the sink.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:13.760]   What sport do you have? I have the 2012 escape. It's my foot forward.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.280]   That's a big giant thing. No, no, no, no. That's the soccer mom one.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.840]   You see the one that parks itself? Yes, that's the one. They have parking
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:29.760]   itself parking on it, even the focus. I like that. It was week two in Google versus Oracle,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.000]   Oracle versus Google. If you've been under a rock for week one, basically the deal here is
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.840]   Oracle suing Google saying that Google should have taken out a license in order to include Java,
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:50.160]   in the Android operating system. Week one was both Larry's on the stand testifying.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.520]   I equate this whole thing to the BAFTA Awards. You know what the BAFTA's are, John?
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:04.000]   Yes, I do. The Bay Area is it the Bay Area after? Is that Leisure Suit Larry? Is that a
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.040]   Games Awards BAFTA? No, I think the BAFTA's are the British.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:15.040]   The Amish, which is, you know, to us Americans, we don't know anything about the films. We're
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.760]   just interested in what stars show up and what they wear. And so that's my theory about this
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.520]   trial is that week one was kind of boring. And week two has actually gotten interesting,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.080]   though. It's shocking me. Not only do we have, the Larry's weren't there this week, right?
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.680]   They were not there this week. But we had Andy Rubin there from Google.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.000]   There were two of those this week, I think two. Got it. And the big developments, Andy Rubin,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.720]   despite the fact that he sent supposedly the smoking gun email saying, hey, we should get that
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.120]   license from, you know, the Java license from Sun. He said, no, I didn't really think so.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:57.280]   And then the interesting thing is crazy, crazy story is that the copyrights are a mess now,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:03.760]   the actual process. So I as when they pulled up the files that supposedly showed
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.760]   what what was copyrighted, what was on the disks? Apparently the records from the
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.680]   Copyright Office said that no disk was submitted. That's the first thing, which is a problem,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.680]   because you're trying to go ahead and copyright something you got to submit something. Oracle says
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   it has records, though. So the thing is, Google's trying to say, look, you want to say you're
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.840]   this is all copyrighted. You didn't submit anything. So how could you possibly do this? So I mean,
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.920]   this is a little specious because you don't need to submit anything anymore to for copyright.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.720]   That's the thing. Like I'm thinking there's probably there's a lot of ways to get around this.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.840]   The headlines read like, oh, they're going to win on technicality because of this. It's like,
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.080]   Oracle's probably got a lawyer smart enough to figure out like authentication and figure out,
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.880]   you know, the documentation. It should be pretty easy to figure out. But then I think the more fun
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.840]   stuff was like the verge going into all of the everything that's in discovery. So we found out
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.880]   a bunch of stuff with the Google phone 2006 subsidized plans for 10 bucks that Google wanted to do
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.120]   with a discovery is great. That's why these companies don't like to do these lawsuits,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.080]   because discovery just reveals all kinds of cool stuff. Yeah. And judge also said in the beginning,
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.840]   like, look, unless unless it's the recipe for Coca-Cola, this stuff's going to be public.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.040]   So whatever your plans were, whatever your little, you know, mutslinging is, we're going to show it
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.520]   publicly. Don't ask for it to be hidden. So the Google phone thing to me, 2006 was interesting.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:23.120]   But then there was another phone where it looks like a Sony Ericsson phone was supposed to be the
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.160]   flagship Android phone. The Xperia phone, right? Wasn't it supposed to look like that? It looks like
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.760]   apparently it would be a, we'll look like a PlayStation Go. That's a mock-up you're seeing these days.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.000]   And you'd slide up the screen and there'd be a porty keyboard that could slide up and you'd have
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.120]   a gamepad. And then Google decided to go to Nexus S instead. And so this could have been a huge
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.040]   break for Sony. Actually, if you think about Sony Ericsson at that time, they still existed.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.480]   Sony bought out Ericsson, I think. Was that this year? Yeah. Late last year that yeah, maybe.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.560]   Yeah, they bought out their partner. And so like this could have been a total shift for Sony.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.600]   I mean, who knows what they could have done with it. Well, you have to assume that whatever they
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.520]   do is wrong. So that's what they did. Yeah, that's that's the other thing. Under the 2006
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.920]   Google Android phone looked a lot more like a BlackBerry. There's no touchscreen. There's no
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:16.080]   emphasis towards multi-touch gestures, any of that stuff. So a lot of people are screaming like,
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.960]   oh, they did steal from Apple. Maybe they did. It looks exactly like that Facebook HTC phone.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.240]   Remember the white Facebook HTC phone? With the cha-cha. It's also I can't remember these names
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.200]   anymore. Just keep seeing the same concept images every phone. Every hit phone. There you go.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.400]   Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty. It's a pretty clear indication that they saw the iPhone and went,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.520]   uh-oh, we got to do something different. Yeah. And so they didn't, they made a copy.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.720]   What do you make of the of the the T-Mobile revelation? Basically, what they said is we
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.080]   want to subsidize the data plan and make $9.99 the data plan price. That'd be great. See, this would,
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.120]   this was my point is that it would have really changed the way that people adopted smartphone.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:04.080]   Some bean counter came in and said, hey, buddy, you can't do that and expect to make a nickel.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.480]   I mean, it does cause money to run data through that cell system, you know.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.040]   Well, looking at Apple's numbers based on just their revenue from Q1, they could buy T-Mobile.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.080]   The numbers that AT&T was thrown around to buy T-Mobile was like 32 bill.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.840]   Actually, I've been looking at the kind of, they can buy almost anybody.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.360]   Name a company. They can buy country. It's almost.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:31.440]   Do you, do you happen to know if our numbers, you know, there are occasionally reports done by
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:38.080]   reputable institutions that count number of Americans or Westerners as online, like whether
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:44.240]   they have online population? Are mobile numbers counted into those figures? Do you know,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.960]   how much are you talking about? Are we leaving certain people completely?
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.040]   Like what about the people who only have feature phones?
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:57.440]   I was watching some congressional hearings over the weekend.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.080]   Good times.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.600]   Yeah, it's just the thrill.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.480]   It is what they had some people from Nielsen on and they do those numbers are counted.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.320]   Are they are?
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.880]   And I mean, I don't want to be a jerk at all, but I mean, we can, we can laugh about those
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.680]   quote unquote six people who only have feature phones. I think there are a lot of hard up people
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.600]   and a lot of economically marginalized people who still do have feature phones.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.080]   There are a lot of people throughout this country just don't need a smartphone.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.920]   And I wonder, you know, are we talking past them or around them or not to them? You know,
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.680]   should we include them in our discussions?
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.880]   Well, what is it? 50% penetration on smartphones in the US.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:41.600]   It's the second fastest adoption since radio of any technology.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.640]   And I think the only inhibitor is that data plan.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.280]   I mean, I know a lot of people who, you know, they have,
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.920]   you know, they have old sidekicks and stuff that they're just,
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.320]   they have actually lost some connectivity from T-Mobile because they don't want to pay the data plan.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.360]   You're kind of hosed.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.640]   You know, if you don't want to pay the data plan, you're hosed, but this is my rant.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.800]   You will let us back up on this rant.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.920]   Would you hose it about what?
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.760]   Would you can't be floating around a restaurant and do web surfing?
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.600]   No, well, when you originally bought the phone.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.360]   Oh, you mean the phone functionality?
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:15.840]   I don't know.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.200]   You believe it's been heard.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:22.480]   I think, I think people, I would just say that I do think that people, you know,
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.680]   based on some of the growth numbers you're talking about, that even people who you might think
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   couldn't afford a smartphone are considering it a necessity, whether or not that's the right call.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.080]   I think they are, and they're finding a way to put that ahead of other needs.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.760]   So the people who are buying phones, and by the way, when they look, they're seeing fewer and fewer
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.120]   feature phone choices. So they're kind of steered in that direction anyway.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:55.040]   But I think that more people are simply saying, well, this is just something I have to have.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.000]   It doesn't know. One way or the other, this has got to happen.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.200]   So basically what you're saying is that people are just going to go straight from having a
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:07.040]   feature phone to having the Google glasses. That's just the natural, that's the natural jump,
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.280]   right? Because those will be out in a couple months.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.600]   Yeah, these are actually Google glasses. That's why they're so shiny.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:18.320]   So Sebastian Thrun, who is lead engineer on many things, he's the guy, I actually went on the,
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.080]   he drove me around in the Google car when I went in the self-driving car.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.040]   Now you're, oh, I thought you were going in the camera car.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.640]   That's what I want to go around in.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.360]   Let's treat you.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.120]   I want to see what kind of routing they take, just to see what it's like being in that thing.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.400]   What do they do? Do they stop and take pictures or just constantly taking?
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.280]   Just going.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.320]   Yeah, I'm just going.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.520]   But he took me in the Google, the self-driving car a couple, a year and a half ago when I did
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.920]   that and he's now working on the Google glasses.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.080]   Have you asked him if he ever put a dog behind the wheel?
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.680]   Does he that be great?
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.720]   He'd really, really scare people.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:58.000]   He went on Charlie Rose this week with the Google glasses on and he apparently had a pair that was
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.240]   not the flaky pair that Sergey was wearing at the fundraiser when it's a global song.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.880]   And he starts taking pictures.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.520]   See, watch this.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.560]   He just touches the top there and he takes a picture of Charlie Rose.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.520]   He looks like a Borg.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.560]   I know. He looks crazy.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.840]   I would watch this.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.400]   My Jerusalem.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:14.720]   Watch this.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.440]   Look at his eyes.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.400]   Look at him.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.680]   He's like looking around.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.880]   He's using the gestures of his head to post the picture on Google+.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   Guys, a chick magnet with those things on.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.640]   He looked like a crazy person, didn't he?
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.360]   Yes.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.240]   Well, that's just because that's the first time you've seen that.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:32.480]   Right?
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.040]   Like people.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.480]   Yeah, everybody's wearing it.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:34.800]   We will be.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.280]   That's it.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.600]   They look like they actually made crazy people look legit.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.720]   And they were talking to somebody.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.760]   They still do, by the way, make people look nuts.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.920]   Yeah. So that looks, you know, you're staring at a camera.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.960]   You're like, OK, staring this way.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.920]   OK, I'm going to click this way.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.200]   That's going to wait to do it.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.560]   I would imagine people just get used to this or they would have,
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   I would have, I think the worst thing is when you take them off,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.840]   you might still do the gestures.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.720]   I think we should go back to bullying, where a guy grabs the glasses,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.320]   throws them on the grab the stomp sign.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.720]   But they used to do his glasses with the kids.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.400]   What if they used to say that eyes are the windows to the soul?
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.480]   I mean, when you start wearing these things and look at how his eyes focus
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.800]   somewhere in the middle distance or something like they know,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.480]   he's talking to Charlie Rose.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.560]   He's no longer looking at Charlie Rose.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.720]   I would think that can be incredibly off-putting.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.960]   So you're going to have people who you think even, you know,
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.240]   they're walking towards you and you think,
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.280]   oh, they're kind of looking at me.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:21.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.240]   Are they? Oh, why is he about to walk into me?
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.440]   Because he's looking at his Google overlay world
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.040]   and he's not actually paying attention to you.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.840]   I'm not fascinated by the technology.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.440]   I think it's really brilliant stuff.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.040]   I like the head gestures and all that.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.280]   But I also think that maybe we're heading down a bit of a dark path.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.400]   Yeah, I just agree with you.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   I don't think that, you know, tens of thousands of years of human evolution
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.360]   and how we read people's faces and their expressions
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.200]   is going to suddenly be changed when we're like,
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   oh, he must be wearing the Google glasses.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.520]   So I'm going to excuse that crazy behavior.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.120]   It's like, no, he has Tourette's.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:01.280]   So you wouldn't get a pair of John's, what you're saying.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.240]   No, I mean, I got into an argument with my son,
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.760]   who was a millennial about this.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.240]   He says, oh, no, I said, this is dumb.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.840]   This is my typical thing.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.760]   So he says, oh, no, this is what you want.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.440]   And then he goes into this long explanation about all how useful it would be.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.760]   Because you could look people up while you're talking to them.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.560]   You could be doing all kinds of crazy things.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.600]   You can be checking out, you can be doing searches
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.160]   and all these things in the background while you're doing something else.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.680]   And I'm thinking, really?
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.840]   And he is totally convinced that these are going to be the hottest thing ever
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.680]   for this group of anyone under about 27, I guess, or 30.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.720]   As a parent, I just am desperate to keep my kids single focus,
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.520]   given how multitasking oriented the world is right now.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.560]   You know, I just do not want their brain to be trained from a young age,
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.320]   to be so scattered that they can't even focus and have a conversation with you
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.840]   without going and looking away and twitching and taking a picture and posting
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.280]   and doing all those things at once.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.320]   Remember when the mobile phones first came out and it was rude to either leave the
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.200]   ringer on or use them in a restaurant?
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.520]   Now, whatever restaurant you're in, even if it's a pretty high-class place
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.320]   with rare exceptions, it's considered OK to have the phone there.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.600]   I don't think it's OK.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.200]   It happened. I see people on the phone constantly always researching the internet.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.800]   Oh, I know I'll get the answer to that.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.240]   What was the name of that guy who we all are?
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.040]   Let me look it up for you.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.440]   OK, well, that's a social use.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.560]   I mean, there are a few--
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.160]   Well, the phone is a social instrument.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.640]   I think this whole thing changes.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.680]   In other words, what I'm trying to say is don't expect what you're
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.760]   envisioning for your children to actually work out.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.320]   Oh, my God.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.040]   John, D.C. Devorak and I are going to be doing a parenting show.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.480]   It's going to be the next podcast.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.840]   God help us.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.400]   Google. More Google. This week, Google Drive.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:44.960]   It's real.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:49.360]   Google Docs will transfer over to being Google Drive.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.160]   You can install Drive on a Mac, a PC.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.840]   There's going to be an app for Android, an app for iOS coming soon.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.120]   And let me see if I can break this down.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.800]   Five gigabytes free.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.840]   Twenty-five gigabytes are $2.50 a month.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.720]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.160]   A terabyte is 50 bucks a month.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.680]   And old plan subscribers or grandfathered in.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.960]   Is this a big deal?
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.760]   Is this going to be the evolution of the ecosystem
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.360]   where people are going to say, "Okay, that's it.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.000]   I'm all in.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.800]   I'm not going to use Office anymore.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   I'm going to use it just like Dropbox."
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.760]   And it's going to integrate into Chrome OS.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.880]   Yeah, Google Docs is going to go into Chrome OS.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.600]   I don't know if people are going to go into this one any more than they did with
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.920]   Dropbox or SkyDrive or any--
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.080]   At this point, I'm just collecting these.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.280]   Like, I just have a bunch of these.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.160]   Like, I have Google Drive.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:40.720]   I have this drive.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.160]   I can separate my stuff out.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.840]   But at least I have about, like, almost 50 gigabytes of stuff and storage,
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.320]   like, on the cloud because there's so many free services at this point.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.920]   Yeah, you take five here at five there.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.560]   I want to suggest for someone who wants to code this.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.560]   I know that there's actually some--
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.480]   It's a violation of some of the terms of service,
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.840]   but I think it's doable.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.640]   And call me.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.840]   Well, I'll help you promote it.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:06.080]   A piece of software code that finds all these free five gigabyte things
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.520]   and coordinates it as one.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:08.960]   Virtual drive.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.840]   Oh, that's genius.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.880]   Excellent idea.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.760]   So you take--
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.240]   I got--
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.640]   And now I have, like you said, you got 50 gigs.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.360]   Why isn't that one?
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.800]   It's a 50 gig unit.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.920]   See, at least your computer says there's 150 gig drive.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.600]   And you just deal with it that way and use all these things.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.120]   So every free one that comes out, you get all--
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.760]   And you can use your email box, too, with Google gives you.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.320]   That's why I was thinking--
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.400]   You're jail-breaking your cloud storage.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:30.880]   You love it.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.520]   That's why with the clients, at least, you can do a search on your own operating system.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.080]   That's the only saving grace I have right now, because Dropbox and I have Google Drive and SkyDrive.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.880]   So I have all three of them, but at least Finder can look for a spotlight can,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.640]   or I can use Windows for that.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.040]   But until there's a web version of that, which would be great.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.560]   And a web file manager that's like, yeah, I'm aware that you have files everywhere.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.680]   That'd be really nice.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.480]   The chat room says they came up with this idea four weeks ago.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.240]   Oh, there's always some media chat room.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.040]   It says that.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.480]   I'm only describing it.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.520]   I'm only under--
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:05.120]   Pulling into the APIs of Google Drive, that it could show just like it shares a show--
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.160]   Shared folder.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:11.280]   It could additionally show and talk with a Dropbox folder, a box, not Net folder.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.840]   I don't think that would be too terrible to read.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.680]   Well, then they say they're going to have apps that are going to come out for Google Drive.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.320]   They're going to have apps.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.760]   You can do a web editing.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.640]   Somebody will build an app.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:21.760]   What do you have?
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.400]   How many--
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:22.960]   How many--
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.360]   How many--
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:23.840]   How many--
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.400]   Everything up into the cloud, into Dropbox.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.800]   I used Jungle Dick's disk with Amazon.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:34.160]   I put Dropbox as my top level folder and moved everything under that.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.400]   And I paid the $200 a year, whatever, for the tons of storage option.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.240]   Now, obviously, I keep local copies and I keep backups of those local copies.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.600]   But it actually works incredibly well, particularly--
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.120]   I've run a podcast network.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.160]   I need to be able to share with other people media files.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.240]   And setting that Dropbox, paying $200 and setting it as the top level folder,
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.800]   has worked out incredibly well because of the things that it does that are very similar to Google Drive.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.760]   And that it just syncs and I don't have to worry about it.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.320]   So I think--
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:02.960]   Jungle--
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.040]   Jungle--
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.440]   What?
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.440]   Yes.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.000]   That's what he--
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:08.480]   Why have--
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.040]   I don't feel this.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.080]   What's curious.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:18.800]   Why-- why didn't Google just build this as an extension in Chrome as opposed to an actual install?
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:24.720]   And how often does Google have besides Chrome browser, something that you actually have to install on your computer?
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.360]   I mean, everything happens in the cloud with them.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.840]   It's always extensions.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.360]   So it just seems a little bit odd that they did it in this way, that they couldn't figure out a way to just say,
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:39.960]   OK, well, Chrome browser is also your folder, file folder container, exactly like it is, by the way, in the Chrome OS.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.680]   So why would you need to actually install anything?
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.840]   Well, I think that part of the answer to that question is on this week in Google, Denise Howell is saying,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:53.440]   if you're up in Redmond, you're asking, how come Google gets away with this level of--
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:58:00.000]   I don't know, it's coercing might be a strong word, but putting their product out in a format
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.360]   that forces you to embrace a lot of their product?
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:12.000]   And you're asking, how is that not anti-competitive when Microsoft was doing very similar things
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.400]   and got their hands slapped for it?
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:26.000]   So you've got an operating system, a browser, a document system, a storage system, a search engine, an email client.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:32.800]   How is that not tying all these things together in a way that's anti-competitive?
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:38.160]   It is, I think, the Chrome OS-- no one's using Chrome OS as their operating system.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.320]   Right now, yet, but how long has it been out and what's the percentage of penetration?
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:51.720]   So you have to actually own a significant chunk of the market, in any market, to be looked at or considered a monopoly,
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.280]   and they simply don't have that.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:59:01.360]   They don't even have-- Chrome as a browser is certainly moving up, although I wouldn't say they have overwhelming market share.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.840]   But the operating system, talk to anyone.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.720]   No one's using it.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.920]   And Windows is still there?
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.040]   Absolutely.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.680]   Still there.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:19.920]   So in looking at this, is this something that's going to get people off of Microsoft Office?
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.040]   Is this going to change people's perspective in terms of Google Drive?
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:27.200]   Is it going to make Google Docs any more appealing?
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.080]   Not to me.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.640]   I don't know.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.000]   I mean, the weird thing is they rebranded Docs into Drive.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.960]   And I guess it's good you have offline versions of your documents now.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.840]   But this would be like if Office became SkyDrive.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:47.920]   And that's not-- it's kind of this weird combination of things, because it's a creator of content, and it's a storage area.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.080]   So that's where people started freaking out in terms of service.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:50.760]   Like, do you own this?
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.880]   Are you going to be able to copy this?
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.080]   What's going on there?
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.040]   Dropbox, on the other hand, is like, look, you own your stuff.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.200]   We don't even care what kind of stuff you have.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.600]   But you're not creating it in Dropbox.
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.640]   You're not creating it in Microsoft.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.920]   But in Google, you are.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.440]   You're creating it in Drive.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.200]   You're creating your spreadsheets in there.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:10.840]   And then you're thinking, it's a weird combination of things in this.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:16.440]   It's making me slightly uncomfortable with this idea of, why are my Docs now with my Drive?
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.120]   Like, they don't have to be that way.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.640]   And they will think--
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:25.440]   I was going to say, do you think that Google has a tremendous naming problem?
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.520]   They just finally decided to call folders folders.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.480]   They were collections now, they're folders.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.840]   They're trying to call their creation platform Drive.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:40.240]   They seem to be all over the map when it comes to--
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.960]   in fact, I just don't think they're very good at it-- naming products.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.160]   They're sometimes so they'll name the same-- their operating system is the same name
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   as their browser.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.160]   Is this confusing to you?
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   It's just how we like to do things.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.960]   Yeah, by the way, I thought that was unbelievably dumb.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   [LAUGHS]
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   Cry.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.560]   It's great at nothing but confusion.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.760]   Also, creating confusion, and I think the hiccup is mostly over where the terms of service
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.120]   that got people really up in arms.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.400]   This was the line, particularly.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.960]   It's the same terms that were in Google Docs.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960]   But whenever--
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.200]   I'm in the bus terms of service that people are bitching about.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.600]   It's the part that's creepy is--
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   uh, da-da-da-da.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.280]   When you upload or otherwise submit content to our services, you give Google a worldwide
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.480]   license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.400]   And then this is the part that gets really weird.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:35.400]   Communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute such content.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.200]   Yeah, we were talking about that on techniques today.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.160]   I mean, that's basically like every time you create a piece of content, you get a bunch
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   of copyrights.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.320]   And to write that just means, look, we should be able to do with the stuff what we can.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.040]   Like, if-- let's say we were sharing a document and you wanted to translate it to Spanish,
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040]   that's a derivative work.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.320]   And if they don't write that in the terms of service, you can't-- they couldn't do anything.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.680]   You'd be locked out and they-- you could, I guess, theoretically sue them for copyright
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.400]   infringement because they made a derivative work of, well, this spreadsheet, like maybe
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.800]   the line up today, that kind of thing.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.680]   So publicly perform, though?
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   What does that mean legally?
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.320]   It's just like some piece of boilerplate that got in there.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.520]   It reminds me of the day, years and years ago, I remember when Xerox was in the desktop publishing,
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.800]   they got in the desktop publishing business with a page maker kind of clone.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.160]   I forgot the name of it.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.600]   And I asked to see a copy.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.360]   So they-- I had to sign this crazy document that went on and on about liability for somebody
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.440]   getting injured by the product.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.480]   Because apparently it was just boilerplate from a copying machine.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.640]   They took copying machine, the license, and gave it to-- and put it on software as if
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.360]   this is going to kill somebody.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.720]   When you jumped up on top of the software box to get an image of your cheeks and you
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.280]   fell off on the way down?
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.280]   Right.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.000]   That would be one of the reasons they had to put that in there.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.240]   I blame the lawyers.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240]   Yeah, the lawyers.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   They just flop it.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240]   So generous.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240]   Sloppy.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240]   Unolorous language.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   Nothing clear.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:03.160]   And they think they're doing their jobs by protecting their clients from all kinds of
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.120]   liability and giving them, you know, the-- it's the-- the what if, you know?
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.440]   So write it as if anything could happen and you're protected and you have the rights
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440]   and abilities.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:18.400]   You know, I don't think that Google is intending to dive into people's personal information
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.600]   that they put up on drive and then just pull it and pull it, you know, put it out there
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.320]   to the world.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.480]   But it's sloppy at best.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.160]   I mean, the TOS is a full of sloppy and ridiculous and unenforceable information.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.680]   You either trust Google or you don't, right?
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.400]   I mean, bottom line-- if they-- if they did that, it would be corporate suicide.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.040]   So bottom line, you either trust them or you don't.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.960]   Lance Eulinoff, we trust that you have to leave us now.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   What, you're going to rouse him?
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.280]   He could have-- you could have-- he could have-- he could have stuck around for a while.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.640]   Well, I don't want him to leave, but he said he had to go.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.160]   Well, you don't have to be the one that's forcing him out.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.560]   I'm the mom on this show.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560]   Geez.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.720]   You have to go to your homework, I think, Lance.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.720]   Go on.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.360]   So thank you very much for joining us.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.320]   Lance Eulinoff, Mashable.com.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   He's a good man.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.280]   He can handle the abuse of John C. Devorak.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.520]   And we appreciate your time on a Sunday.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:13.880]   We are going to come back with more of this week in tech, including walmart.com, the website,
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.560]   letting you pay with cash, a woman texting, falling into a hole.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.560]   That's always good.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.560]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.560]   Yeah, that's--
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.560]   I want to check your--
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560]   Great work, China.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   Clush bag score.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   I don't do a Clush bag.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.360]   He'll be right back.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.360]   Leo?
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   Thank you, Becky.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.360]   Walle, eh?
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.480]   We'll get back to more tech news in just a bit, but I wanted to tell you a little bit
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:40.920]   about the best thing that ever happened to me as a small business owner, freshbooks.com.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.520]   When I was young and naive and I was doing my own invoices, I didn't get paid a lot because
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.840]   I would forget or probably more likely put it off.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.720]   And then I-- you know, you don't invoice, you don't get paid.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.200]   Sometimes I'd wait eight or nine months.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.640]   By that time, nobody wants to pay you.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.600]   Then Amber MacArthur was Amber that told me about freshbooks.com and my world change.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.720]   Freshbooks is the easy online invoicing app for any small business.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.880]   It'll save you time.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.040]   It gets you paid faster.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.440]   They'll even print out invoices.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.440]   There are still some clients that want a paper invoice.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   No problem.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.720]   For a small additional fee, they'll print it, stamp it, and mail it.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:22.000]   But most of the time, what you want is the invoice online, the email invoice, because
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.240]   on it is a button that your clients can pay you with.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.680]   They press the button and they get-- I think there's something like 11 different online
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.840]   payment services like PayPal, authorized.net, and so forth.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.720]   And so you actually get paid faster because it's easier for your client.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.360]   You can even set up AutoPay, an auto bill if you want.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.760]   If you do time and hours, a lot of us-- you know, bill for the amount of time we spend
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   on a project.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.320]   They've got an iPhone app that'll actually time it and then import that data into the
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.320]   invoice.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.320]   They also have a web-based app.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.760]   If that's easier for you, this is such a good service.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.960]   I want you to try freshbooks.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.360]   I've been using them since they started in 2004.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.280]   And now, 3 and 1/2 million people have used freshbooks for their invoices.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.320]   Try it free for 30 days of unlimited usage.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.280]   Everything you need, everything you want to do, free for 30 days as many clients as you
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.440]   want.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.720]   They've got automated late payment reminders.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.080]   So you know, if you don't get paid right away, they'll handle that.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.160]   It's just fantastic.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.680]   Freshbooks.com, 30 days free, all I ask is if they ask you, "Where did you hear about
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680]   this?"
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.120]   Becky Worley told me.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.960]   Give Becky some credit and to it.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.880]   You can mention that too.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   Freshbooks.com, looky, really.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.960]   You've got to try this today.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.280]   Speaking of the Becky, let's get war-lised.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.280]   Becky?
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.360]   Yeah, let's get war-lised.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.760]   Worley told you about freshbooks.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.040]   But she did also tell you about tech news today.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.040]   And Tom Merritt is going to give us a little preview on what's coming up this week in the
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.040]   tech news today.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.560]   Hey, thanks, Becky.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   Good to see you.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.480]   Some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on tech news today.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.880]   Monday, April 30th, Google Wave finally ends access.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.120]   It hasn't been editable in a while, but you'll have to get your stuff out before Monday.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.600]   Tuesday, May 1st, BlackBerry 10 Jam kicks off.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.000]   Also Mortal Kombat hits the PlayStation Vita.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.680]   Wednesday, May 2nd, Tumblr is supposed to launch ads and Yelp announces earnings.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.560]   And Thursday, May 3rd, Samsung launches the next Galaxy device and find out what it's
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.560]   going to be called.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.640]   Tudor Brown steps down from ARM.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.600]   All that and more on tech news today in the coming week.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   Back to you, Becky.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.280]   This is This Week in Tech.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.240]   I'm Becky Worley, sitting in for Leo LaPorte.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:40.200]   Don't worry, he'll be back on Wednesday, but joined by John C. Devorak from channeldevorak.com.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.960]   And don't forget to know agenda show.com.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.920]   I have to plug that or I get grief.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.520]   I as actor from--
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520]   Tech news today.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   --the news today.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.560]   And Dan Patterson is joining us from Co-Point.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.800]   Thank you so much for being with us.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.800]   Dan, appreciate it.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800]   Thank you.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.200]   Let's do a little meat and potatoes.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.120]   Right now, SISPA, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.720]   I as size.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.280]   There's nothing like policy that gets people excited.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.960]   Let me see if I can do this some justice.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   Okay.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.440]   This has been passed in the house on Thursday.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.480]   And basically, it's intended to safeguard the United States against cyber threats.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:25.840]   Memorizing as best I can, it allows technology companies who have information they feel is
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.040]   in the best interests of national security.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.000]   If they want to share that information with the national government, with the national
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.560]   security director, they may.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.640]   It's voluntary.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.360]   Without the risk of being sued.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.840]   Is that the closest to a short summary?
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.840]   No.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   Okay, let's hear it.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.960]   Well, I don't have a short summary because I don't think there is one.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.200]   I do, and I spoke with a colleague of mine who covers the House of Representatives.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   I covered the presidential campaign and occasionally the White House.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.800]   He knows the House very well.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.640]   And you can listen to all of this as a mini report that I did in the same show with Gina.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.720]   Essentially, Becky, you did a pretty good job.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:14.120]   I would add to that indemnification and clarity of routing of information in that it appears
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:21.160]   to be something that, A, we need to understand what's happening with this bill and not hyperbolicly
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.640]   freak out because the biggest risk of SISPA is that little portions of this could slip
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   in.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.480]   It is intentionally designed to be dismantled and that portions of it could slip into the
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.480]   legislation while we are all distracted with this campaign that's going to happen over
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.880]   the summer.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:41.280]   What we need to watch for is indemnification and routing of information, meaning like who
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.000]   is responsible for what types of information and where did this come from, where does this
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   go?
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.800]   Because information can pop up like blips, be reported to certain places, and then disappear.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   Does that make any sense?
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.200]   Yeah, and the big issue I think right now is that as it stands, if a technology company
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:05.800]   and many of them are behind this bill, Facebook, the CTIA, I think 41 of the 120 companies
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.640]   that are represented by an industry technology group, Microsoft is apparently backing away
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   from it.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.320]   If one of those companies shares information with the government about what they perceive
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:23.640]   as a threat, either to someone, physical threat, child pornography, terrorism, national security,
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:29.640]   if they share that information and the government uses it incorrectly, the government can be
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.960]   sued, the company cannot.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.920]   My understanding from what the EFF is saying and some of the other organizations that are
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:44.320]   against it is that the company should be liable if they incorrectly share information.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.840]   Yes, and that some actionable components of this can come down to individuals or departments
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.480]   within technology companies.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.600]   So generally, when we look at things like accountability, we're worried about, oh, this
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.280]   group or this company, just like you said, Facebook or Google is responsible.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.480]   But now an individual actor or a group of actors within a company can report something
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:10.640]   and step outside of typical protocol and that would then default to the government to be
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.680]   responsible for instead of, again, like Facebook or Google.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.200]   And in this case, the biggest and most scary thing, well, not the biggest, but a big scary
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.760]   component of the bill is that the government has a ton of precedent and prior legislation
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.920]   that indemnifies them all over the place from being sued.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.920]   Right.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:35.080]   The other part of this that freaks people out is one section that specifically says that
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.680]   companies may share information and use, I'm quoting now, cybersecurity systems to identify
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:46.520]   and obtain cyber threat information to protect the rights and property of a self protected
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520]   entity.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.600]   And I think people are nervous that this could be misappropriated to protect intellectual
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.160]   property, protect, you know, this could be used in a, in a how to share file information
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.880]   about file shares.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:05.680]   I, as you had the really good point that in constitutional law, very few words are written
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.240]   and much is interpreted.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   Right.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   That's the week.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.400]   I was like, I don't understand.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.080]   I'm not figuring out whether you're trying to defend this piece of crap or what, because
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.720]   this is like one of the most onerous things when you start looking in, especially the
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.000]   amendments that have been dropped in here.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.840]   This is just another attempt to spy on the American public.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.080]   It's just that simple.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.000]   And if you look at the people that are against it, now you know why Microsoft's backing off
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.520]   off is you look at the people that are against and read what they have to say.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.880]   And I think that they pretty much summarize what the problem is.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.120]   This is an onerous piece of legislation that should be fought against.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.120]   And luckily the Republicans have pushed and pushed it so hard in the, in the, in the
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.360]   House of Representatives that the Democrats just as a knee jerk reaction will probably
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.560]   reject it in the Senate.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.360]   So I'm not that worried about it.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:59.400]   It will be rejected in the Senate and in POTUS, the White House has vowed to veto this.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.800]   A lot of that could change in the campaign year and a ton of it, like you said, Becky,
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.040]   will come down to constitutional interpretation, how this particular Supreme Court chooses to
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.080]   interpret many of the properties of this law, not the entire thing, but again, properties
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   of it.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.080]   And I want to get back to that, but one thing, two important distinctions.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.000]   One, this will go to the Senate not next week because they're on hiatus.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.240]   But it looks like there's a different competing bill, the Lieberman bill, which basically
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.360]   the same smell, but has some, some subtleties.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:35.600]   And as far as the Oval Office, they, what I heard is that advisors are going to suggest
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.600]   that it's vetoed.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.040]   It has not been clearly stated that it will be vetoed.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.600]   But, but go back to what you're saying about the interpretation I asked because I think
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600]   that's, that's interesting.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600]   Well, yes.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.560]   The thing is you could, a lot of people complain that there's not, there's a lack of definitions
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560]   of this.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   There's, there's some vague things about this.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.920]   And there is, there are real problems with this bill that there are, there's a lack of
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.920]   definitions.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.400]   But when you get to somebody trying to add an amendment, they added in some clarity to
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.480]   what this covers.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   And then there was another vague term in there, like national security, like what does that
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   mean?
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.360]   And if you can, you can go ahead and you can write a law that's extraordinarily tight,
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.120]   let's say the tax code, let's study this, and there's regulations, six volumes of this
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.440]   stuff, that gets litigated as often as the constitution does and the constitution is
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   like one sheet.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.280]   Pretty simple, it's simple, right?
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.120]   All your rights are on there.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.560]   It, it's, there's really no perfect law that can be written anyway.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.400]   So let's get that out of the way.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.760]   But the thing is, this could be written better.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:36.000]   It could be tighter, but it, you don't necessarily want this to go to a court and then you have
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.240]   to have like this huge problem first, right?
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.800]   It gets passed.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.920]   Something goes wrong.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.800]   It's got to get litigated up to the Supreme Court for interpretation to a certain point.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.560]   If you write the law better in the first place, you don't have to get there, but you still
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.040]   will have interpretation for a very long time.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.200]   And what, what is this supposed to do?
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.760]   What is this law supposed to accomplish that we needed at all?
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.800]   I'm going to postulate what I think is the scenario and tell me if I'm wrong.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.360]   Okay, I'm Facebook.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:08.320]   I somehow come across some information that's privately being exchanged that I think is an
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.720]   issue of national security or child law.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   You think.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   I think, I think.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.640]   I escalated up the channels and it's decided.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.880]   So you're going to be like, like somebody in Cuba just turning in their neighbor.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.160]   What about you not thinking about it, but you hate somebody.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.720]   So you turn them in on that basis.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.720]   Oh, I'm not saying there aren't a gajillion ways this could be misused, but let's just
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.120]   say what's the use case.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.920]   So I, I go to the bosses and I say, I think that we should share this with, with the NSA.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.920]   Right.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.400]   And they say, do you think priests should also do the same thing?
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400]   I'm just wondering.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400]   I'm Catholic.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   Don't get me started.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]   I'm just saying.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.360]   So we, we, so at this point, this information has been decided by Facebook that they think
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.520]   it should be shared.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.000]   Now there's a liability issue.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.800]   Now they have to run it through the lawyers.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.560]   The lawyers are going to tell them unless this is a sure thing, horrible terrorist action
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.760]   going on, very obvious clear case, they're going to say, don't share this.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.600]   We are, will be in such liability.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.160]   This is a huge big deal.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.400]   That information dies.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.880]   It can only be accessed if it warrant, if they get a warrant and how is the government
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.520]   going to know that they need to get a warrant to ask Facebook these questions.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.880]   So I, I'm not saying it's right.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.000]   I'm just trying to say what the scenario is.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.280]   Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but what happens if Facebook decides to do something
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.240]   like you just described?
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.560]   And then over time, it turns out that in discovery and some other issue, a whole bunch
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.960]   of instances of similar things that took place that Facebook never took any action
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.960]   on.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.160]   You talk about putting yourself in a bind to get really sued.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.960]   It's like, how come you called this guy out, but you didn't call this guy out?
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.560]   And how come, and here's a more owner situation that you never even brought up.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.040]   Are they now liable for some sort of violation of this look and they get really some bad
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   action happening?
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.440]   I mean, this thing opens up a can of worms that is, it's frightening for any company
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.880]   and to be backing it, which Facebook is, they're voluntarily saying this is great, which is
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.880]   mysterious to me.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.080]   Well, because it relieves their liability on one front.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:08.200]   It may add more liability in all kinds of other ways in situations that they're unaware
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   of.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.120]   I think to even support such a thing.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:17.960]   And why would somebody be able to do something and be legally exonerated in advance?
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.040]   I think that's like a complete violation of the way the system works.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.000]   If you do something, you should be responsible for your actions.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.840]   So if you're like busting somebody, you can't go too bad because this law protects me.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.080]   I can say whatever I want.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.880]   I'm not buying into that being a good thing in any way.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.760]   Playing devil's advocate though, if somebody's liable, whether it's the government or the
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.160]   individual corporations, isn't that good enough?
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.440]   No, if you're liable for something, it's because you did something wrong.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.680]   I mean, if you're all of a sudden making accusations of people that you don't have
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.640]   a got a clue, maybe they did something wrong, maybe they didn't.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.680]   If you think they did something wrong, go up and stand up like a man and say, yeah, I
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.280]   think they did something wrong, Mr. policeman.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.320]   Not like I think they may have done something wrong.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.120]   Why don't you go look into it and I'm off Scott free.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.120]   You can't.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.600]   That's not the way to do business in this country.
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.000]   Since they're protected, they might overshare.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.680]   They'll be like, oh, look, we don't know what we should be reporting.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.680]   We're going to tell you everything.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   We can because we can.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.680]   Do you think that's good?
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   No, that's a horrible thing.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   I don't understand.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   It lets them off.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   There's no liability.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.680]   They're like, OK, we're a company.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.480]   We can say as much as we want.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.640]   And if you make a mistake with it, then it's your own new government.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.560]   I wonder if those are eligible for Freedom of Information Act searches eventually and
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.920]   if that will be a sort of a limiter in terms of what's shared.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.040]   But I mean, going back to your point, John, I see a parallel just to advocate for the
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.200]   other side is that it's like the Good Samaritan law.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.680]   You may not be a doctor, but if you see somebody choking and you go and give them the Heimlich
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.480]   and break their rib.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.400]   That requires an active act.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.880]   There's no active thing on this.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.200]   The companies don't have to do anything.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.200]   They can.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.000]   But I don't have to give that guy the Heimlich.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.360]   Right, but Good Samaritan law would make you have to do it, right?
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   That puts an actual--
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.040]   No, the Good Samaritan law says that I am not liable for breaking his rib if I'm trying
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.040]   to help him.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.400]   So if I'm the company-- Of course, you wonder if you went over some Good Samaritan situation.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.040]   You start beating the crap out of him.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.800]   I'm going to go find it.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.560]   Well, there's no Good Samaritans involved in this deal.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560]   It is messy.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.720]   It's not as bad as some of the other ones that we've seen.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.960]   It's not SOPA, but it's still-- it's a big mess.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:30.040]   Well, it's like I said, I don't really think it's going to get past the Senate anyway.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.840]   But the thing is they'll come up with another one, which would be very similar, probably
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.560]   just as bad, and they'll call it something like anti-chelled porn law.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560]   Right.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560]   And they'll--
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560]   Say to Jill and--
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   Or they'll just give it up and slip it into some military spending bill at the bottom
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.720]   and say, here we got it anyway.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.400]   There's something like this is going to happen.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.520]   It's just that there's no reason for us to kind of roll over every time they come up
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.440]   with one.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.000]   We're going back in time with this next story.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.520]   Yes, thank you for the Time Machine effect.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:07.800]   When you purchase something at Walmart.com, you will now have the ability to pay with cash.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   No, online.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:09.800]   Online.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   Online.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   Online.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.880]   When you're going to scan the bills and then you have to tear them up, how does that work?
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:20.040]   The way this works is that you buy it online and then you choose pay with cash and then
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:26.400]   you go to Walmart.com, you go to one near you, you bring the receipt, they scan the receipt,
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.040]   and you pay with cash.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.320]   And then they mail it to you.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   So you don't actually get your job to pick it up.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.320]   Yeah, that is.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.320]   It's a giant Walmart.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   I mean, they got everything there.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   Let's make the world even more complicated.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.760]   Well, let's just say they have something that's not in your giant Walmart.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   Okay.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.040]   Well, what might that be that I'd want to buy from Walmart?
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.400]   Well, it allows anyone with a computer connection to become an online shopper.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.800]   So you're automatically part of a potential customer base for Walmart, whether you have
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.800]   credit or not.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.400]   Well, and I think this has been a huge inhibitor for Walmart.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.520]   They say only 15% of their transactions are credit card.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.800]   That's because what they're saying is that the Walmart people are the right trash that
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.800]   don't have credit cards.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   It's kind of insulting.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.800]   I don't think that was in the press file.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.400]   Then they were positioned to say you could send gifts easier.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.280]   I think they got all the tech news today earlier this week.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.800]   It shows that that Walmart really knows their customer base.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.200]   If I get the money, some cash into the store.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.920]   I'm telling you, if it shows you the state of the economy as well, if Walmart is the
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:40.560]   biggest retailer in the United States and they are adopting something like this, that
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:47.360]   it shows you the state of not just the Walmart shopper, but the shopper in general.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.440]   I think this is an incredibly smart move in their part.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:58.880]   It's so interesting that they're just reinventing the model though to just say, and I mean, Walmart
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.760]   is the hub for a lot of places that don't have access to the kinds of--
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.600]   Oh, you mean places that have been driven out of business.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:11.600]   Little towns have been ruined by giant Walmarshas being placed outside and decimating the small
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600]   medium-sized business that was within the city.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.600]   Well, great.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.240]   And if you're listening right now at replies, if you're listening right now and you live
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.600]   in one of these places, I've lived in one of these places.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:24.720]   And I bet a lot of Twit listeners live in these places where you are not in control
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.400]   of the economy of Main Street, but Walmart moves into town and you become effectively
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.560]   a company town.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.080]   I'm not saying this is necessarily good or bad, but I'm saying that this move by Walmart
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:39.560]   reflects the state of our nation and the state of the people who are not just in Walmart's
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.560]   audience, but in the Tech News Today audience.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:48.720]   I've never been so happy for Walmart in my life when I was in Murfreesboro, Arkansas.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.480]   And oh, I lean was with me.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.480]   Right.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.480]   I'm just like there with you.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.480]   I remember that.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.480]   What do you need?
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.600]   And we were in a dry county.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.600]   We had to drive 17 miles to Walmart.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.000]   You guys are that hard out for a drink?
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   It's tons of booze.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.360]   That's a long way from home.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.080]   Because Walmart has everything, you're going in to pay for something you bought for somebody
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]   else or for yourself.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.560]   You're going to go into the store, you're going to wander around, you're going to end
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.920]   up buying other stuff.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:16.920]   That's the other thing.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:22.120]   If you have a wata cash in your pocket, you're like, oh, I'm only here to spend the $58 I
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:26.120]   spent on this particular DVD player or something.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.200]   You're like, huh, they do have booze over there.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.480]   I'm going to go get that too.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.800]   And while I'm here, I'll get a gun because they do have guns.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.800]   You want some clothes?
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.200]   You're going to want to pay for anything.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.440]   Well, you'll buy other stuff and that's going to get Walmart more and more money and
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.480]   that's their job, right?
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.200]   That's-- hey, it's just-- I just think it's a cool convention just to completely flip
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.200]   the paradigm.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:51.360]   Well, if you want to think about business, it takes business by-- like Walmart can afford
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360]   to do this.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.960]   I'm sure a percentage of their audience is going to default on this or not be able to
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960]   follow through.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.720]   And it shows also that a company like Walmart is saying, well, we can save enough money
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.800]   and credit card processing fees to acquire this marginal, this fractional audience, but
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.640]   we're still willing to do it.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.640]   That's the business, huh?
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.960]   So did you bring this topic up, which seems to be obtuse because you're long-warm?
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960]   Walmart, is that the deal?
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.480]   Or are you thinking of going-- do you buy some options, maybe?
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.480]   It's definitely in my phone now.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.480]   Some calls?
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.480]   Some calls?
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.480]   Thanks, Charles Schwab.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   I'm going to talk to Chuck.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   You should.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.480]   You should definitely talk to Chuck.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.840]   All right, what do we want to talk about people?
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.720]   We have so many exciting things to talk about, I tell you.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:35.440]   Why don't we take a break and then we'll decide if we're going to talk about Clushbag.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.560]   Girl falls into sinkhole while texting, asteroid mining, Leonard Nimoy, or 30 women in a brawl
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.560]   over a Facebook post.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.560]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   So think about what-- which of those stories do you like?
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.560]   You know which one I'm picking.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   I don't know.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.960]   All right, Leo, go for it.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   Thank you, Becky.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.600]   More with our great Twit panel coming up in a bit, but I first-- I must-- I would be remiss
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.560]   if I did not mention stamps.com.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.400]   Nobody wants to go to the post office anymore.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.120]   I haven't been in ages, not because I have people, because I got stamps.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.960]   Stamps lets me print official US postage from my computer and printer.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.840]   I have a post office at my desk.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.000]   I got the stamps.com USB scale.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.440]   I just plopped the letter or the package down on the scale.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.360]   The scale tells stamps software.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.400]   Boom, it prints out the right post to every single time.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.440]   Sometimes you ever do this because you want to make sure you have enough.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440]   You put extra stamps on that.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   That's costing you money.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.040]   And it looks so unprofessional.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.080]   You got 50 stamps on an envelope.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.920]   Stamps.com makes all your mailings look more professional.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.160]   In fact, it is more professional.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.520]   It works with QuickBooks, for instance.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.120]   So all your invoices, it'll pull the addresses right out of QuickBooks and send them out.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.320]   If you're an eBay seller or an Amazon seller, it's so cool.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.120]   It even does international postage.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.960]   In fact, it will fill out the forms for you.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.800]   So you don't need to go to the post office anymore.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.120]   Even for big packages, the mail care comes and gets you can even schedule a free pickup.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.240]   It's absolutely free.
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.000]   The post office loves stamps.com.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.840]   You will love stamps.com.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:08.880]   Right now, I've got a no risk trial offer worth $110 for you.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.360]   So you go to stamps.com.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:16.160]   Instead of the $80 offer you see on the front page, I've got $55 a free postage.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.480]   When you click that microphone, it's in the upper right corner of that silver.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:27.600]   I click that and use the offer code TWIT for $110 bonus offer, including a month of stamps.com.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.800]   The USB scale you pay only shipping and handling.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.600]   And $55 free postage.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.480]   Apps.com is such a great deal.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.480]   You're going to love this.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.880]   I want you to try it right now with this $110 no risk trial.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.320]   Stamps.com use the offer code TWIT, of course.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.040]   You could use the offer code BECKEY, but they wouldn't give you anything.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.680]   Offer code TWIT.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:55.200]   Meanwhile, speaking of getting nothing, it's more BECKEY WARLAY and the-
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   Whoa!
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.440]   Leo just blew up.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.520]   We boom up, but he will be coming back.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.120]   He will be reassembled from many pieces.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.960]   He'll be back Wednesday from his Norway trip.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.440]   I'm BECKEY WARLAY, ABC News Technology contributor.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.040]   You can find me on Twitter.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.200]   Be Wirley.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.120]   John C. Devorah, caffeinating.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   Madly.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.120]   Yes.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120]   How do you do that?
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.600]   It's like the nighttime.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.000]   Does that- I have a cappuccino machine.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.840]   No, I can actually sleep on coffee.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.000]   The- I had a cappuccino machine that- I have a cappuccino, one of those pavonis, so you
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.320]   can really make a real cappuccino.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.560]   And I always like that you have some of them for dinner and then you just offer them one
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.280]   of these, especially after dinner.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.000]   And I said, "You sure you can drink caffeine?"
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.520]   And so you give them a double.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.760]   And it's hilarious when they- because the next day they're complaining bitterly.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.880]   I didn't get any sleep.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.040]   I has actars here.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.600]   Thank you for joining us and being the voice of reason.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.600]   I guess that's what I'm doing.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:57.200]   And Dan Patterson joining us, my ex-ABC News cohort, and now doing his own thing.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.960]   Dan, you know, tell us a little bit about what you do.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.000]   I quit my job in November to start a podcasting company.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.320]   And since January, I've been covering the presidential campaign.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:13.280]   I covered the United Nations as a member of their Correspondents Association and the campaign
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280]   all summer.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.680]   But, you know, I'm literally doing, you know what Leo did?
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:18.840]   I'm doing that.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.360]   I work with some all and am funded by their team and we have an office here in the studio
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360]   in Soho.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.600]   So we are literally- seven days a week.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.880]   We're making podcasts and audio reports, content.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.200]   Listen to that voice he's got.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   He's got a radio voice.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   Oh yeah.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.600]   He's got a radio voice, man.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.160]   That's right.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.800]   The space shuttle was flying over your fair city, Dan.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.840]   Apparently a couple of times.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.080]   Yeah, did you see it?
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.080]   I flew one.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.080]   I did.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.320]   It flew the enterprise over after the other one.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.320]   That's cool.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.120]   Was it- were people standing in the streets pointing?
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:59.280]   Yeah, I live in a neighborhood called Brooklyn Heights which has a promenade that stretches
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.800]   along the East River.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.160]   And although the space shuttle flew up the Hudson, it did a, you know, flew around the-
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.760]   what do you call it?
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.240]   A Statue of Liberty downtown and then flew up the Hudson.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.400]   And there was tons of people out.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:16.600]   It was a lot of- you know, the best thing about something like that is less about seeing
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.920]   the space shuttle and more about the affirmation of geeky things.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.840]   Like, awesome.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.600]   Tends of people really, really care about something as geeky as a space shuttle.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.600]   That's really affirming.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:34.080]   Leonard Nimoy was welcoming the space shuttle to New York and had a good story.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.480]   Eileen, do you have that video?
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.840]   What a great day that was in 1976.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.440]   We the cast of Star Trek were invited to be there in Palmdale, California when this
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:51.160]   ship was rolled out for the first time the hangar doors opened.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:59.280]   This wonderful ship came rolling out and the Air Force Band played the theme from Star Trek.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.320]   It was a great day for America, a great day for us to be connected to that history.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.880]   We're very grateful.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.600]   I want to thank the people of the Intrepid.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:14.480]   I want to thank NASA for giving us the Enterprise, Gerald Ford from the Navy of the Enterprise,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:20.080]   the Star Trek fans who insisted that it should be to gain the Enterprise, to the scientists,
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:23.600]   the engineers who make these wonderful things happen.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.680]   I say to all of them, as an Enterprise, live long and prospering.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.160]   Thank you.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:38.200]   To your point, Dan, I think just a great nod to geek culture and space of files.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:43.760]   Another really important event that happened this week in technology is we had another
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:52.160]   amazing video of someone walking and texting and falling into a hole.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   She made the hole.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.400]   Well, this is the most important thing.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.320]   Whether she was texting or not, she's going to fall into this hole.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.680]   It looks like this is Chinese construction.
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.120]   Get used to it, people.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.800]   If you're not watching, this poor girl is walking along the sidewalk.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:11.440]   It looks perfectly normal and out of nowhere while she's texting.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.920]   A hole just materializes beneath her feet.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.640]   She falls 20 feet down into the hole.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.960]   The taxi driver stops, helps her.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.880]   In the interview afterwards in the video here that's on YouTube, he says she wasn't responding,
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.560]   didn't look like she was breathing, but then he shook her a little bit and she was okay.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.560]   That's first aid, I guess.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.640]   I mean, even if the person was looking at the ground, it looked like it was a regular sidewalk.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   It just fell apart.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   There was nothing under it.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.000]   They pieced it together and said, "Why should we put any construction?"
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.560]   Let me stand over there.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.400]   It's unbelievable that this is the kind of thing they get away with.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.400]   Well, if anything, she should have had an augmented...
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.560]   Not even a sinkhole.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.560]   It's not a sinkhole.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.560]   It's just a bad construction.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.720]   Well, we need an augmented reality app so that you can look down when you're walking
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.560]   around and say, "Hey, look, that's a sinkhole."
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.560]   It's not penetrating.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.080]   You have to walk around penetrating radar now.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.080]   That's right.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.080]   Penetrating radar.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.080]   That's going to be good, John.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.080]   That'll save Nokia.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.080]   Good.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.800]   So, other really important news and technology.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:18.680]   Apparently, in Sacramento, California, very near to us here, there was a Lasivius Post on
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.040]   a married man's Facebook page.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.040]   Okay.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.040]   His wife is a Lasivius.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.040]   The Lasivius Post.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.760]   His wife was not made by his wife.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.400]   It was made by another woman.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.400]   Okay.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.520]   Apparently, his wife did not take kindly to that post.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:38.560]   And so she, not only was she affronted by Facebook, but she used Facebook to set up
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.720]   a girl fight.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:48.640]   And so she and a group of her Facebook friends initiated her Facebook friends.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.440]   Yeah, gang.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:58.720]   Came after the woman who made the post with baseball bats outside of a Bodega 7-11 type
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.920]   shop in Sacramento.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:05.840]   30 girls, baseball bats, people taken to the hospital, and the woman you just saw there
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.360]   in that picture, she was the owner of the store where the fight took her.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   And I'd like to see the women.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.360]   She said.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   You see pictures of them?
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.200]   Do they organize as a Facebook group first?
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.200]   And then, yeah.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   Right.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.360]   Then they had a special tab on their browser.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   There might have been a G+ circle that they formed.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360]   Oh, right.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.360]   To keep a private.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.400]   I think so, because the privacy settings were a little clearer there.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.920]   There was a woman who ran the Bodega did say that they looked hot and breathless after
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:32.920]   the event.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:33.920]   I just wanted everyone to know that.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920]   Hot?
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920]   It's different.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.920]   No.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.320]   Classy news.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.600]   Judge orders woman to go online, retrieve psychic chats.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600]   Okay.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.600]   I guess hasn't even heard this.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   No, haven't.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:52.680]   Randy Glaser, 43-year-old New Yorker, asked for the Rosh Hashanah holiday off.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.920]   Her boss is confused by what that means and asks her to come in for meetings during the
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:58.920]   holiday.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.480]   She doesn't come in.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.360]   She gets fired three days after this all happens.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.360]   And she sues for wrongful termination.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.800]   During discovery, it turns out that she was using her work computer to do psychic chats
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.120]   with an online psychic service.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.120]   Okay.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.160]   Called live person.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.000]   And in discovery, the judge says, "Okay, you have to make those all available."
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.480]   And so she has to go online, retrieve all of her chats with the psychic where she was
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:30.480]   ...
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.480]   This is the way the discovery works.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.480]   ...convection about her boss.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.680]   Oh, this is not going to be good.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.120]   And they are turned over.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.640]   Is this communicating with your priest when you're talking to your psychic?
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.280]   I mean, should there be privilege there?
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280]   Should there be privilege, I guess?
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280]   I don't know.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:46.880]   I mean, the obvious joke is the psychic didn't see this coming.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:47.880]   Exactly.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.720]   Yeah, you beat me to it.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.640]   That's like, you're going ... you should not be doing this here.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.640]   That's ...
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.160]   Yes, your going to ... discovery is going to wreck us both.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.800]   What do you think?
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.440]   No, of course not.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.440]   She's completely ... she should be absolutely forced to do that.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:09.400]   I think most of the ways that you're protected with priests and others, I think, is all codified.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.840]   And I don't believe psychics are listed as one of the ...
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840]   Yes.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.840]   Yes.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.840]   Yes.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   A big psychic cloth.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:16.920]   Someday, someday, maybe.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.640]   But ... so, no.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.040]   John, you heard of cloud bombing?
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.040]   No.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.040]   You know cloud, right?
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.040]   Cloud.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.040]   K-L, that thing.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.040]   So it tells you ...
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.040]   Oh, your cloud scar is six.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.040]   Right.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.880]   Based on how many followers you have, based on the engagement level you have with your
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   followers, check in on cloud.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:35.880]   Right.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:37.280]   I don't see the point of cloud.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.080]   Dan, do you ... have you seen it?
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.080]   You know the cloud?
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.000]   Yeah, I know that people get bribed to use the service.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.520]   I mean, beyond that, I don't have much use for it.
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.320]   It makes me a little nervous because I don't want people to think that your cloud score
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.840]   has anything to do with ... like, let's say you're applying for a job and you say, "Well,
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.080]   you know, when I use social media and I can bring those skills to the job."
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.400]   What's your cloud score, lady?
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.400]   Like, that makes me nervous.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   Somebody else should sit to quantify that.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.400]   So ...
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.400]   Right.
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.760]   And the fact that ... I mean, this is a company that doesn't reveal their methods, claims
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.520]   to quantify something that absolutely we need transparency on.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.840]   And then when their service stumbles, they send them free Nokia phones and cars.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.840]   I mean, come on.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.840]   What?
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840]   Yeah, they did send out Nokia phones.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.840]   What?
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]   Yeah, they have perks, right?
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:24.040]   So when do you have a certain score and people listen to you?
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.320]   Like, would you ... you just qualify for a free sweatshirt, but ...
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.080]   Oh, I don't want a sweatshirt to get plenty of those.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:29.080]   They didn't have a Nokia giveaway.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.080]   I think it was the 800 or the ... it wasn't the 900.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.080]   But it was one of those ones.
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:34.080]   Right.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.080]   No, I think it was the 800.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.080]   I mean, it's just not a bit 800.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.080]   And people ...
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.360]   The idea, the problem they're trying to solve is great.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.000]   Like, let's try to quantify some things.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.160]   But Becky, right.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.160]   I mean ...
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.160]   It's me.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.840]   I will never go into a job interview and have them say, "Well, what's your cloud score?"
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840]   Right.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.280]   And now the other thing that's a little nerve-wracking about cloud is that people can identify what
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.680]   your area of expertise is.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.240]   So, cloud bombing is when you go in and start writing areas of expertise for people that
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.240]   has absolutely nothing to do with anything.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.240]   So this thing is game-able.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.240]   It's totally ...
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.240]   Well, it's not good.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.240]   It's not good.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.800]   It's totally a self-selecting group of people who really, really need to be assured that
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.800]   they have value in this world.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.800]   But I mean, the great thing is that some of these cloud bombs are really ingenious.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.800]   Okay, what's all this?
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:25.840]   Well, I could go in there and be like John C. Devorek is an expert in ... I don't know.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.840]   Cat herding.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.920]   I was trying to come up with something clean.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920]   Thank you so much.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.680]   Captain Kipper came up with that one.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.600]   Thank you.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.160]   And now there's a whole new gaming of cloud.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.960]   It's called your Clush Bag Score.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   I never heard of this.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.520]   Is it what douche bag score?
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.520]   Pretty much.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.800]   Yeah, it says, "Measure how much of an ass hat you are on Twitter."
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.880]   That's actually what it says.
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.480]   I'm not making that up.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.520]   Oh, yeah, I saw this.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.520]   It's bull crap.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.800]   Okay, so let's try the real Devorek at the real Devorek.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.800]   And by the way, the reason I don't like this ...
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800]   Uh-oh.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.240]   Well, here's what bothers me.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:05.200]   If you do a lot of retweeting, which I do, because I believe that one of the things that
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.200]   you do on Twitter is retweet because it's something interesting and you don't want to
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:12.200]   just create a note, you want to give guy credit for the post and you just retweet it.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.520]   It's of interest to your listeners or viewers or followers.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.360]   So how is this bad?
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.520]   I don't know.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.520]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.520]   Well, according to the Clush Bag ...
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:22.520]   Well, you're a 45.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.760]   Who do you think is the biggest abuser of Twitter?
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760]   Who do you guys think?
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.600]   Well, you mean on the panel or do you mean like you're the general ...
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.600]   On the panel?
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.600]   Try Patterson.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.400]   He came across as a good guy.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.400]   I was like ...
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.400]   61.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.400]   Oh, no.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   Clush Bag.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.720]   I don't know, Clush Bag.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.240]   What about like ... what's Michael Arrington's Twitter handle?
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.680]   I think it's already douchebag.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.640]   Actually, I leave his checking Leo's.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.640]   Leo.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.640]   Leo's 60.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.640]   Leo's ...
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:52.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.320]   See, Ian Patterson go together.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.080]   How about you, Eileen?
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.080]   Ian.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.480]   I believe I'm a douchebag.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.480]   Hold on.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.320]   Okay, let's try @AringTess.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.320]   I think ...
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.320]   I don't think he even does much.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.160]   I think I might have won because I looked at this earlier.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.480]   You're at 61 so far.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480]   You're the winner.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480]   Dance the winner.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.480]   Dance the winner.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.480]   So far.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.480]   But wait a second.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480]   Try his.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.480]   Try his.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.480]   No.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.480]   Why do I went down?
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.480]   All right.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.480]   What's yours?
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.200]   I used to be 62, now I'm a 55.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.400]   Arington's a 58.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.400]   So I'm almost out.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.400]   Oh, we can beat that.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.400]   I think I'm nice.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   35.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.400]   Yeah, you don't do anything.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.040]   I'm only a bit of a prat.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.640]   You're partially angry on yours.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.640]   This is a bogus, bogus, bogus site.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:37.640]   I'm angry.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.640]   It improves nothing.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.640]   Well, I don't know.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.640]   I just ...
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.640]   What's your goal blend?
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.640]   Somebody suggested that.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.640]   Ever.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   This is when he gets ... what is he?
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.640]   Scobolizer?
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640]   Scobolizer.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640]   I think ...
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.440]   No, one of the things it does measure is if you disregard the English language.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.440]   It's syntax.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440]   If you go all lowercase, you do ...
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.400]   Yeah, you are due for the number four.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.240]   I have a habit of doing all lowercase.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.240]   Oh.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.240]   I stopped, thanks to this ...
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.240]   Oh, who cares?
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   Oh, Scobolizer.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.240]   34.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.240]   No, that's the best.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.240]   He's nice to me.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.240]   Becky, that's Becky.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.840]   I know, but Scobolizer is the 34.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.840]   Well, let's try Ace Detective.
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.840]   Exactly.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.840]   That's Merritt.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.400]   He's got to have a really high number.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.400]   No, he's like ... he's going to get ... except he does ... he gets all stressed out.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.400]   Sometimes he has typos.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:20.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.400]   Hold on.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.560]   He's not even on there.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560]   He's already ... he's off to scale.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.560]   See, I love this stuff.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.960]   All right, that's enough of this.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.960]   It's definitely a little bit ...
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:30.960]   There you go.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960]   It's 27.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.960]   I know.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.360]   Oh, see, he's the nicest of us all.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]   Oh.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:36.360]   There's a lot of English issues.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.600]   I would look at this in the opposite direction.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.760]   He has typos because he's all stressed out trying to make show time.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:41.760]   Oh, no.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.760]   I thought he was doing UK English, and that's probably worth testing again.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   Roy.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.400]   What's your goal is it extra use?
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.200]   As Poopy Cat says, this is a dumb website.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:57.000]   All right, so I go to Zinga about three months ago for some story that I'm doing for Good
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]   Morning, America.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.040]   And, you know, they have a huge cafeteria down.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.320]   What do you know about all that free stuff you used to get?
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.640]   You still do any of that?
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.080]   Oh, you even know all the infomercial stuff?
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.080]   I got infomercials, a plenty.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.880]   I didn't bring you any laser hair removal.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.160]   I was looking for some more ... Snuggies?
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.960]   No, there's things you ... there's these soak up stuff with ...
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.960]   Oh, you have shamwalls.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.960]   Right, last time I brought you shamwalls.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:24.280]   I'm creating a Pavlovian response with the Vorac when you see me.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.080]   So it's the basement of tech TV, right?
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.080]   650 Townsend, basically, is the Zinga headquarters.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:38.520]   And when you walk in, they've got all this food, all this coffee bars, and huge bar,
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.520]   massive bar.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.640]   Like a real bar with blues.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.400]   Oh, like many taps.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.400]   Oh, cool.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.080]   I mean, they have all the typical perks.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.240]   They've got the yoga studio and they've got ...
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.080]   You've been to the restaurants in Google.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.080]   Okay.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.080]   This is Zinga, right?
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.080]   Right.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.080]   The gaming company.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.440]   But it was the beer that kind of ... They had ... Laguna, Laguna, La Gonita's IPA, and
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.800]   Ankerstein, and maybe Trumor.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.800]   What do they have?
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.800]   They had some good stuff.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.440]   I think it was ... I don't know.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.560]   I think it was La Gonita's because it was like the whole dog theme.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560]   Dog, yeah.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.080]   That's like ... Yeah, I guess.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.360]   But so there's ... I'm just kind of thinking ... is that a good idea?
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   Start-up beer.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]   Totally.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360]   People work in crazy hours.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.360]   Yes.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360]   Yes.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.360]   Boozed up.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.360]   Boozed up.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.360]   Having office romances.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.360]   Getting snaked out of IP, IPO, you know, shares.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.360]   That's exactly how they probably bought back those shares for the IPO.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:32.360]   They're like, "Have some free beer."
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   And by the way, while you're here, did you sign this?
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   Because I would like that share back.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360]   Right.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:44.200]   I bring this up because there's a story on CNET about this company that they have a
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.960]   whole tap or a big fridge of beer.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.560]   It only opens up ... It's at the company when all of the time sheets for the week are in.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.160]   So basically, if you've done all your hours and they're submitted, the electronic beer
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:01.560]   fridge only opens when all the work is done.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.560]   Huh.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.360]   That puts a lot of peer group pressure on the people that are behind in their work.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.360]   I know.
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.200]   And I guess my point is ...
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]   Yeah, what is it?
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.640]   Don't we have some beer in our fridge back there?
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.640]   No, not really.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:14.640]   I know how much you love beer.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.640]   I do?
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.640]   No.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   I was going to bring you some nice wine.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.640]   Yeah, you didn't, did you?
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.640]   Yeah, I got you a Stella.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.640]   Does our work here?
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.640]   Stella, our draw.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.640]   Yes.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.640]   All right, well, we can drink that.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.640]   Nice.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.640]   Nice.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:29.640]   Twist off.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:30.640]   Is it twist?
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.640]   I'll be thinking that with me.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.640]   Oh, here, here.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:36.640]   You're going to break your hand with it.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.640]   You got this one, right?
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:38.640]   You got this one?
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.640]   You got to do that.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.640]   I don't know.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.640]   You think it's pressed?
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.640]   Ooh, what are you going to ...
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.640]   I'm not really sure where this is going.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.640]   This is like very dangerous.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.640]   Haven't you seen that trick before?
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640]   I have not seen that trick before.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640]   That's a great trick.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.640]   What?
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.640]   I have not ... Okay, so you've opened a beer bottle with another beer bottle.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.640]   She opened a beer bottle with ... This is only Becky could do this, by the way.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.640]   She opened a beer bottle with another beer bottle.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.640]   I think I've seen it all the time.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.640]   It went out getting it all over herself.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   I know, and probably the only one in the studio who can tap a keg, too.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.640]   Oh, no, I can tap a keg.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:08.640]   In fact, I keep a tap at the house.
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.640]   They start taking lessons from you.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.640]   Oh, no, I never.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:13.640]   I'll have to demonstrate that and make sure that it's open.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.640]   Why did you ... How did you know the top one wasn't going to bust open?
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.640]   Because you use your knuckle as the leverage point, and so you put one side of the beer
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.640]   cap under the other side, leveraging it off your knuckle.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.640]   Then if you're really good, and if I wasn't worried about the dress, I would just do one.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   It would just come off.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   Oh, wow.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.640]   So our work here is done.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:34.640]   Okay, yes.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.640]   Girl Scouts, they learn all kinds of weird stuff.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:44.640]   Thank you all for enduring this week in tech with not Leel Laporte.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.640]   John C. Devote, thank you so much for coming in.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.640]   Good work, Becky.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640]   Great time.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.640]   Thank you, Becky.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640]   Cheers.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.640]   Thanks, Ayas.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.640]   Thank you all for watching, and just mark some other ...
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640]   And you live with me.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.640]   This week, and Dan.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.640]   And Dan.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.640]   And Dan.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.640]   The can.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640]   Cheers.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.640]   The term is another twit.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.640]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:09.640]   Two of the twins.
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:12.640]   Two of the twins.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.640]   Half of the stuff up there is like that.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.640]   So your camera looks like a drop cam.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.640]   Is that the right one?
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:17.640]   Hey, come on.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:18.640]   Sorry.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.640]   It's the only thing.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640]   He has studio here.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.640]   How are you guys?
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:24.640]   Can I get it?
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:25.640]   He's got a beer too.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.640]   Security cam cam.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.640]   I know.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.640]   It's like security cam.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.640]   What's going on?
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:30.640]   Security cam.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.640]   What's going on?
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.640]   Let's see you guys.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.640]   Here's Ayas.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.640]   What's going on?
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.640]   Oh, yes.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640]   No, no, no, no.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.640]   Really?
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.640]   Oh, that's crazy.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.640]   All right, let me call the man.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.640]   That's just insane.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.640]   Really?
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   That's your camera for today?
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640]   It's just a coincidence.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:45.640]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   I can't do any better.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.640]   This is the studio, and we're working on like ...
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.640]   Actually, you're making an ice coffee.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.640]   Oh, okay.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.640]   I mean, this is our radio studio, and we have cameras.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.640]   This is a crappy little Skype camera, but we have cameras going
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.640]   up, you know, you can't see them.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640]   Your audio sounds fantastic.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:04.640]   It's just funny because we look like we're sneaking in on you.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640]   It does.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.640]   What is this?
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640]   Who is that?
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:08.640]   That's Dan Patterson.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.640]   Oh, Patterson.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640]   That's a ...
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.640]   Hey, man.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.640]   John's like, "What is that?"
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.640]   He's like, "He's all blown out with the lighting."
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.640]   Yeah, that light actually helps.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.640]   Sorry.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:21.640]   He actually looks like, "What's his name to comedian that was on the show with Cleveland?"
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.640]   We're watching another ...
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:23.640]   Is that lighting?
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:24.640]   A funny video.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.640]   A funny video.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:27.640]   Somebody falling into a sinkhole or something.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:31.640]   If I'm going to walk through the back of the shot and wipe out little man, I'm going to make
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   a show for sure.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.640]   Drew Carey, looks like Drew Carey.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.640]   Nice.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.640]   We're quite comfortable.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:38.640]   You guys should come hang.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.640]   Where are you?
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.640]   Well, you got your round table.
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.640]   We got our round table.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.640]   New York.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   New York.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.640]   New York.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.640]   Do you have blinds behind you because we can't actually can't see your face.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.640]   Well, there you go.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.640]   I don't know.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.640]   It's sort of the witness protection program a little bit.
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:56.640]   Yeah, it looks all in either, but yeah, it totally looks.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.640]   Hello.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.640]   Hey Lance.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.640]   How's it going?
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.640]   Good.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.640]   Can you send us some video?
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   Well, they didn't trust you.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.640]   The video is not live.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:05.640]   It's not me yet.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   Send him all the muscle you got.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.640]   Oh, a second.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.640]   I'm not sure what's going on there.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640]   That's good, Dan.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640]   You sound great.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.640]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.640]   You guys called it, said it was had some problems.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:22.640]   Every time he's on, I've seen the ... she can't seem to make these things work.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:26.640]   Ever since you went to Mashable, you just can't.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.640]   No, I know why that is.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:29.640]   We can discuss that on the show.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.640]   Dude, they're making money, Lance.
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.640]   It's very brave, man.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:33.640]   Video, video.
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:34.640]   I know how this all comes.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.640]   How does this video thing work?
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:39.640]   Why am I not getting this to go?
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.640]   Skype profile.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.640]   Oh, look, he's in there.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:42.640]   Damn you.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.640]   Status.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.640]   Status.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640]   Context.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.640]   Call.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.640]   Call.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640]   Call.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640]   Video.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   Turn.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.640]   Oh, there we go.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.640]   Hey.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640]   There he is.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.640]   I'm wearing my Mickey Mouse ears here.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:02.640]   That looks classic.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.640]   Thank you.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:04.640]   Thank you.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.640]   That was the whole point because otherwise I don't sound so good.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.640]   I like the yellow room and it bounces off the top of your head and lighting.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:12.640]   It's fantastic.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:13.640]   Isn't that nice?
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.640]   Isn't that nice?
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:15.640]   You get this right here.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:16.640]   It's good.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.640]   I shaved my head just for you, John.
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:22.840]   And I like the reflection since you apparently refused to spend the extra $10 on non-reflected
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.640]   lenses on your glasses.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.200]   So we get to see what you're looking at.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.640]   So if you go to porn, we're going to know.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:34.640]   Yeah, we can see in these little screens here.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.240]   Devorah, Leo's not here.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.640]   We had to be nice and ask these people to come join us.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.640]   So don't scare them away at the onset.
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.640]   No, he won't be scared away.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.640]   He's not that easy to scare.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.640]   I know.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.640]   Well, he's actually a lot more scary than he is scary.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.640]   All you ZV alums can handle the abuse apparently.
