[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And we had decided to have a little small panel here so we could get together.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   A week before the holidays and just really get down and talk with John C.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Devorect.com/blog channel.devorect.com
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Devorect.org/blog/NA.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   N-A.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   (laughter)
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Something like that.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Already it started.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Hey John, he's wearing the shirt for you.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   This is from the North Dakota State University Bisons National Champions.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   They repeated this year and I need to repeat one if you guys...
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So this is last year's?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yes, I got a couple of these.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Oh, John, I expected better of yours.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Well, this is just one the other day.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And nobody's provided you with the new one.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The 2013 edition.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   The new version.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And then of course 2014 when they were again.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   They could, they could repeat.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   That'd be the second in the history of NCAA football to do that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The original being Appalachian State.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   They did it three years earlier.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And do you have an Appalachian State?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I have tons of Appalachian State.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I see I went to the University of California and I...
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   They're such...
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   The worst football team and athletic director should be fired and the coach should be too.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   They lost.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   They won nothing.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And so I had to find these obscure teams that win.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   To where they're shirt.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You don't want to wear a cow shirt.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   No, you look like an idiot.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Also here are newest staff members.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Well, not yet, but soon at Twit.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Mike Elgin of Elgin.com and Google+ and it's so great to have you Mike.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So great to be here.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I actually went to UCLA which wins in sports.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And they do it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It's part of the same system and it stuns me that the lead university within this system
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   can win.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   No, no, no.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   They're the second rate rate.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That's cool.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   All the money should go to Cal Berkeley and they apparently refuse to...
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I don't want to get into it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Why don't I even bring it up?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Why?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Why?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Anyway, Mike will be taking over Tech News today starting at the beginning of the year.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And we're so glad to have you aboard.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You brought your family.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Your son who just got... is about to get married.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yep.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That's very exciting.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   His fiance who's about to pass out.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Your son told me that he made a deal when he proposed that he would get to wear Google
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Glass during the ceremony.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yes.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I mean, she's a keeper.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That one.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Boy.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Well, I guess we'll see.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Actually, it's a good idea because family and friends who couldn't be at the event, they can see it from the
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   groom's point of view.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I think we should get her some glass so that her side could see it from her point of view.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   That's right.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   No.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   She's not that good of a sport.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That was pretty unequivocal.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   No.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Not gonna happen.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Did you see the robot that Google just bought?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   The eighth company that Google has bought this year, they're not buying spree for Andy Rubin who's now we've found running the new
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   robotics division of Google.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   If you weren't scared of Google before, you will be scared now.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   This is a company called Boston Dynamics, which is a spinoff from MIT.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   We've seen a new robotics in creepy.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   This is, which is this big dog or cheetah.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Oh, it's all right.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It's Wildcat.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Fastest robot in the world.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   This runs faster than Usain Bolt.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It's gas driven, which kind of they've been doing these for the Department of Defense under contract.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I know this is a smoke coming off this piece of crap.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I'm terrified.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   No, no, no.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm scared.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   This is scary.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   This is a robot.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Okay, first of all, it's gonna go that way and then it's gonna build up some speed and come back the other way.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Are these autonomous or are they remote controlled?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Does it even matter?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The company Boston Dynamics specializes in replicating animal and human locomotion.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So they don't do the intelligence part.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You notice it doesn't have a head.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   They actually did come up with a head for the big dog, which can actually pick up a cinder block and throw it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   17 feet.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah, it's terrifying.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But they're simulating animal locomotion.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   What's brilliant about these robots is you can go up and knock them over and they'll re-balance themselves.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They're really phenomenal.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So that's my question.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Are you simulating animal locomotion because it's really more efficient or just because it's terrifying?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I mean, wouldn't a tank tread be more efficient?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It looks like he's actually going backwards.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Well, I mean, everybody has a different view about what they do about it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Whoopsies.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   But see, it survived.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   The Pentagon is thinking, you know, a pack mule and, you know, the obvious response to that is how about a mule?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Right.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You know, that would be...
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You'll be cheaper.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   We're going to have robots and all kinds of things.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Google is probably going to be very good at the part of robotics that's missing here.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   This is the local motion.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Right.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   What Google can be very good at is the application.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So the most immediate and googly kind of application would be a disaster relief.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You know, a big earthquake somewhere.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   There's rubble everywhere.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   The roads are toast.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And for some reason you can't fly in.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   You can actually send supplies in with some of these robots.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   They also have robots that climb walls and do all kinds of crazy stuff like that.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.320]   But you know, Google is a kind of company where they just can just invest billions and
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.600]   billions of dollars in things just because it could end up being something cool someday.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.000]   This is a big dog and they're showing that's not big dog.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   What is that?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   That's the...
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   You can't touch this.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.800]   That's the hammer robot.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   I think that is.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.000]   That's what we'll be seeing on the streets.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Right.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I don't know why they think...
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Hello, citizen.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Is he taking a dump there?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   What is the deal?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.400]   He's looking around in this what?
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.000]   These pile of batteries on the floor.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.880]   A little bit of a Tai Chi.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   The interesting thing about this...
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.640]   Oh, you Sarah Kana.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.640]   Come with me if you want to live.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   So jumping jacks.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.040]   Now Google has said actually that they're going to honor the existing Pentagon contracts
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.080]   but they're not going to start any new contracts.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.160]   So they're now a defense contractor.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.760]   They are for the contracts that already exist but they're going to get out of it.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.880]   As soon as they can which is really interesting for the Pentagon because the Pentagon I think
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.840]   was counting on these guys to provide robotic mules and stuff like that.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   So now the Pentagon has a...
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   It seems like a mule.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.040]   A mule mule would be just so much of a better choice.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.960]   The thing is that it's software and it's robotics which means that this is...
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.760]   That's the interesting thing is the intelligence involved in the assembly.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.200]   And this is version 1.0.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.760]   I mean apply Moore's law to this and go forward into the future 15 years and it's going to
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.560]   be probably something very amazing.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   That is going to be a problem.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   The problem is Moore's law really only applies to semiconductors and throwing it on everything
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   else.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.160]   That's true but I mean but we know that it's been advancing at an incredible clip and it
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   will continue to do it.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   And by the way...
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.440]   This software advances it roughly the same.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440]   Don't you think it's going to be at all?
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.440]   Not at all.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.440]   No.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   I think that's why the machine everything is going to...
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   That's why the hard work is...
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.800]   ...is having to use pads like it might does because software is dropped dead as far as
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   I can tell.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   So in this technology this kind of thing would have been perfectly impossible 10 years ago.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.200]   It's just advancing so quickly.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.680]   And by the way the Google self-driving car itself is a robot.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   Right.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   Right?
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   That's what it is.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.400]   It's a robot that uses off the shelf parts, namely a car.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   This is impressive.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.880]   I mean I could see why they're using animal locomotion.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   This thing is able to handle...
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.880]   This actually is kind of interesting.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.520]   They kicked it over and it...
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520]   Look at this.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   This looks just like a...
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   It's so good.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   This needs to be in a movie.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   Oh it is in a movie.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.000]   Yeah, let me say.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.160]   It kind of looks like two guys like you know with their legs sitting up on it.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   It really looks human.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   You know it looks like two guys trying to carry something.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   John I hope we're dead before this...
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   Exactly.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   If we were not dead it'll kill us.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160]   Wow.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160]   It's fascinating.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160]   Andy Rubin if you're going to put somebody in charge of something I think I imagine.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   I mean he's a guy who spent his whole life doing robotics.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.240]   In fact, Android the operating system which he helms was really a sideline for him.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.040]   It wasn't something he wanted to be.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.360]   I make sure he wanted to be doing it but it wasn't his dream job.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.760]   And the name Android suggests...
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   Come from his life.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.920]   Yeah, his passion.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.320]   Unfortunately though the Google barges are on hiatus.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.280]   What happened?
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.400]   I decided this story I missed.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   The...
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.600]   Well, government happened.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.280]   The Coast Guard and the agency in charge of the Bay San Francisco Bay Conservation and
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.840]   Development Commission has said, "Whoa!
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.480]   What are you doing?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   You can't just build a scary giant barge and put it...
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.720]   One of the rules of the Bay Commission is that you can't do something on the Bay that
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   you could easily do on the plane."
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   I get it.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   I get it.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   They didn't pay off the right people.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.360]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.320]   Essentially what happened was they pointed out that they wanted to sort of float the thing
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.880]   over to San Francisco.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   Right.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.800]   The San Francisco side and have people on board and have a demo thing.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   In fact, Google internally calls it apparently the San Francisco studio.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.920]   That's their internal name for this thing.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.720]   And somebody said, "You can't come into the harbor in San Francisco.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.480]   You don't have a permit."
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.520]   And then somebody said, "Do you have a permit to be on Treasure Island?"
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.720]   And so I think there's a permitting...
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.440]   They're just doing this stuff.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.000]   And so, CNET apparently has been watching this thing constantly and said that there's
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.240]   been no workers, no nothing going on with this thing for...
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   It's in October.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.640]   So it looks like it's on hiatus.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.400]   It was a stupid idea to begin.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.920]   I know I disagree with that.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.880]   I think it was a really interesting idea.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:40.120]   They had the opportunity to do what Apple stores do, but only temporarily because there's
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   nothing like...
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.600]   Apple has to keep these stores open all year round.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.880]   This would be like one of the special Christmas stores.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.960]   You roll and it's a pop-up store.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   It's a pop-up store.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   It's a novelty.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.520]   People would have flocked into this thing though.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   I think you would have had...
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.120]   I would have wanted to go inside.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.040]   And they would have probably done a business of selling those little crappy tablets and
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.880]   some of the other junk that they have.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.160]   Is there enough money selling crappy tablets to just decide?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   Ask Apple.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   Whatever the case.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   Is it fake?
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.720]   They went on tablets all of a sudden.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   Some of you hate tablets.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   No, I know.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Well, I will just for this show.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   For purposes of this show, are you...
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   For purposes of this show.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Okay.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   For purposes of this show.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, for purposes of this show, Mr. Devorek will be down on tablets.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   Down on tablets.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.280]   Anyway, I think it would have been great.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.320]   The difference is that for the Apple comparison is that Apple sells massively expensive, profitable
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   things in huge numbers.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.600]   Google does not try to make money on it.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.640]   This is a soft, warm and fuzzy thing where they just want people to have a general feeling
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   about it.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.200]   And it's got to be expensive to build a barge and maintain it.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.680]   You have to hire a skipper and like...
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   See, even more expensive now, we can tell you.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.840]   It's not going to pay the permits.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.120]   It has sales, even though it has a sale, it has fake sales on it.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.480]   Well, they're going to have a sale after Christmas anyway.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.440]   Whatever that...
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   Bum.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   It's a weird thing.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   You know what's a weird thing?
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.600]   Google's a weird thing.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.840]   When a company is so successful that they can just spend money on moonshots and on just,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.520]   "Hey, we think it might be interesting to see what it's like."
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.880]   I mean, they've got the drone delivery system.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.040]   They've already been looking at that, much like Jeff Bezos.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.560]   What a fake that is.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   You don't believe...
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   Well, you should have read my column.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   I had a column on this.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.560]   Was that on a new domain?
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.880]   It's a PC mag, I believe.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   Okay.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.600]   And I said this is a...
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   Was this sucker?
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.600]   Charlie Rose got something.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   Charlie Rose got something.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   Oh my God.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.080]   Charlie Rose is like a very gullible.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   You know who didn't get sucker?
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   Charlie Rose.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.600]   You know why?
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.440]   Did they get what they wanted out of it?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   Great numbers?
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   Everybody.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.240]   When, when, when, when, when, the saps have bought into this.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.800]   I don't think Charlie Rose is a sap.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.440]   I think you know exactly what was happening.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.920]   And in fact, they even teased at the beginning of the season.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   Yeah, at least.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   You won't believe.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   Couldn't have...
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   What?
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   Jeff Bezos is planning.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.760]   If you want some guy who's just going to fall over himself, yeah, you get the right guy.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.320]   But you think you could ask one more question.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   One tough question.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.600]   Like, what about the FAA?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.560]   What about killing dogs?
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.080]   What about people shooting them out of the sky?
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   You know, there's a million.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.840]   What are you going to land on my porch, which is kind of hard to find?
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.720]   I think we've now understand why Google has purchased Big Dog.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.040]   It's to take on the Amazon drones.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   Get ready.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.880]   We're going to have drone battles in the streets.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.880]   That's actually...
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.240]   You can jump up and down like a whippet.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.840]   They actually are competitors in terms of...
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.960]   So right now we look at drones as remote control toy flying helicopters.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   That's essentially what they are.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960]   They're remote control.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   There's a little intelligence.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.600]   Even the consumer ones have a little intelligence.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.120]   For example, if you just let go of the controls, they hover in space.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.200]   But go forward five years and they're just robots that have a different form of locomotion.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.240]   And in fact, drones have a superior form of locomotion to a certain extent.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.680]   It's much more efficient to climb through the air than it is to navigate...
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   What after we're about ice?
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.200]   Or lots of things.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.120]   And so, yeah, there are going to be all kinds of forms of robots of locomotion for robots
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.560]   and drones are going to be great.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.760]   There's a lot of research being done, for example, that allow them to fly safely indoors.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.960]   So the dog issue and being shot at the sky, who knows maybe they have little missiles
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.280]   that shoot back or something like that.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Oh great!
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   That's what I like to see.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   How do you have an escalation?
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.640]   They're purely defensive.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   That's right.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   That's missiles.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   That's right.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   If there's collateral damage, well, no.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.840]   The CEO of eBay, which does, by the way, a service called eBay Now, delivery of goods
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.000]   in an hour, you have to buy it from a local store, and a personal eBay shop or delivers
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   it.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.600]   The CEO on Bloomberg TV, John O'Donohue, said, "We're not focusing on long-term fantasies.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.800]   We're focusing on things we can do today, talking about the Amazon drones."
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.920]   I think that's a reasonable point of view.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.360]   I mean, you know, it's definitely a fantasy within five years.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.560]   Don't you feel like, though, that is in the tech industry famous last words?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.360]   No, this stuff is never built.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.200]   Bitcoin's never going to go anywhere.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.040]   You know, this stuff is never going to go anywhere.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.400]   I think that's always famous last words.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.480]   That Facebook thing said, "The CEO of MySpace."
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.600]   That Facebook thing is not going to ever go anywhere.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.280]   But let's do a thought experiment.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.160]   So Amazon is in the massive shipping.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.760]   Have you ever seen the inside of an Amazon fulfillment center?
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.080]   They are moving so many boxes.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.080]   It's mind-blowing.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.320]   So let's say, for example, in a single city--
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.080]   Most of them are my house.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.440]   Just imagine San Francisco and a single day.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.400]   And they're still delivered by trucks.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.480]   But let's say Amazon's going to ship some percentage of their goods via drones.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.760]   10,000, 20,000, 50,000 drones in the sky at the same time flying around San Francisco.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.960]   This is not going to happen in five years.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.280]   Just from a legal point of view, there's no way this is going to happen.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:04.000]   So Bezos said, "We expect FAA approval in 2015, but I think that's just a small amount
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   of the regulatory approval in Africa."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.520]   You don't even have a full of crap.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.920]   It was doing this just to get attention.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.920]   It's not getting any attention.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   It's all about attention.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.920]   It's not getting any--
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.120]   They didn't even have approval to make the YouTube video.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   Oh, really?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.320]   Yeah, that was done outside the US because it's illegal to fly one of these things across
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   an open field.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   No.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.320]   So it's like--
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   By the way, 173 gone.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   So what do you have?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   250 total.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.240]   So you're going to sell out during this show.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   I wish I had one in charge.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.920]   What are you in charge of these things?
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   $30.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920]   It's a good deal.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.920]   No.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   No, it is.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.320]   I can't imagine anything else that's such a good deal is just--
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   Look at the workmanship, John.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   Look at the workmanship.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   It's just like me.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.640]   It's a piece of plastic with a head that's bobbed on top.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.640]   No, but John, but you know, a lot of times--
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   It doesn't even look like you.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   If you get bobbed heads--
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   Who does that look like?
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   It looks like Greg Keneer.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   Come on.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.360]   Well, I look like Greg Keneer when you get close.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.160]   This is the Leo Chief Twit Bobblehead doll I'm sitting on a ball.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.400]   I admit, I look a little thinner than I am in person.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   What are you laughing at?
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   It's accurate.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   That was loud laughter.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   I don't know if I appreciate it.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.320]   It's not as thin as he said.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.760]   It is accurate because in fact, I've seen you sit on a ball.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.800]   Yeah, and that ball though, that's smaller than my ball.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   That's a small ball.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.200]   But we had to make it small to fit in the box.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.960]   I think it's the same size ball.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.600]   Well, in proportion, you think to the--
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   I don't know.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   Anyway, teespring.com/twit.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   I shouldn't even mention it.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.560]   They'll be gone by the time you get there.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.840]   174, we only have 250 of them.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840]   We're going to sell out.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.000]   I don't think we're going to make more.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I think this should be--
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.440]   No, the idea, Lisa, is that you cheese it as though that's it.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   You're done.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   Get in now.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   Get in now by now.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   It's pointed to her.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.560]   And then later, you can go, you know, by popular demand, we made more.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.440]   The company in China actually broke the mold.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.240]   I had them break the mold so there would be no more of these.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   That's a lie.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.440]   That's a good ball-faced lie.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.240]   No, they got the mold.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.440]   They're just waiting there.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.720]   Residence supplies are stocked up.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   They're ready.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.520]   They could make more if we really had to, but only if we sold 200.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.880]   Can the head come off?
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   Should I pull the head?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.080]   No, this has got to spring.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.880]   It looks like you have stretched the spring and ruined it.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.880]   Yeah, so that's nice.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.800]   It's one of those bobbleheads you can't get the head off.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   I like the noise.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   High quality.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.240]   Can a child have this?
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.160]   It's not lead paint.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.520]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.080]   We have a winner.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   We have a winner.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.920]   Remember we had a contest last week with Go to Meeting.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.400]   Let me first tell you about Go to Meeting.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.880]   It's that great software that lets you meet with clients and colleagues all over the
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   world any time.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.880]   This time of year, it's especially valuable.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   People are waiting for the holidays.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.640]   They can't get to the office because of the weather, the big snowstorm and back east.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.520]   Everybody's getting the flu and the colds.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.040]   It doesn't mean business stops.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.800]   It just means you meet with Go to Meeting from Citrix.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.320]   It's how we have our meetings.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.240]   Even if you're just going to do a conference call, we always set up a Go to Meeting because
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.200]   if you want to share screens, you can.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.720]   You just press a button.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.480]   And if you want to see each other face to face, you can with their HD faces, crystal
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.720]   clear video.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.400]   All you got to do is turn on that webcam and your meeting is now a group video conference.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.040]   I know a lot of groups that keep Go to Meeting running all day.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.560]   It's how they work together.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   It's how they collaborate.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.880]   You can start or attend a Go to Meeting from any Mac, any PC, smart phone or tablet.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.640]   You can even present from an iPad.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.680]   So it's that good.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   We love Go to Meeting.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680]   We use it.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.160]   We invite you to try it.

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.040]   or mobile device.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.080]   You don't need a credit card.

[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080]   Click that try it free button.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.760]   The promo code is TWIT-T-W-I-T.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   Now we have a $300 Apple gift card.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.680]   We asked you last week to tweet.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.000]   And do you have this image, Chad?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.760]   Or should I enter it in?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.640]   I can hold it up.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.760]   It's kind of small.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:10.320]   We asked you to tweet where you would like to meet us or have a Go to Meeting and he said
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.720]   he'd like to have a Go to Meeting from the top of Holly Aacala at sunrise.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   I would too.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.880]   That's a bit much.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.880]   I would too.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.480]   Jesse wins $300 because of that comment.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.640]   Well we chose it random.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.200]   But I happen to like this comment a lot.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.880]   Jesse Peters, congratulations.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.560]   And we will get you your $300 Apple gift card.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.200]   This is not associated with Apple of course.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.840]   What was the point of this contest?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.880]   It's for fun.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.400]   Just out of the blue with no point?
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.680]   There's absolutely no point.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.720]   It was just for fun.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.120]   And I think that we got a really good one.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.760]   Holly Aacala would be beautiful.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   Have you been there?
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   Yeah, I actually have.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.120]   I would love to be at the top.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   Look at this picture.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   Take a chocolate.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   Frankly, there it is.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   There it is.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   Holy moly.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.160]   Did he take that picture?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   He did.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.160]   Yeah, from a chopper.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.880]   Jesse, you're a hell of a photographer.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.000]   That is beautiful.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Backlight photo.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.400]   Well no wonder he's a pro.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   Thank you Jesse.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.680]   You've got your gift card coming out to you.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   Thanks for tweeting with us.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.040]   And the rest of you, please try Go to Meeting.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.400]   Visit GoToMeany.com and use our offer code TWIT for 30 days free.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.120]   You do not need a credit card.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.480]   Hey, hey, yo, are you?
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.400]   No, you don't live in San Francisco proper.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   You probably can't use this Amazon fresh.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   They're the grocery service.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   You know, this is web van too.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   They are in Seattle.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   They're in Los Angeles.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   And now what $299 a year?
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.200]   But the guys who use it are going to be using it a lot.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.000]   Well, yeah, if you pay 300 bucks.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.120]   So it's like a prime membership.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.880]   And then is that covered delivery or?
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.720]   Yeah, it covers the delivery.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.440]   It's actually the best part of it is there's a 30 day free trial.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.640]   So fresh produce meets and dairy delivered same day or next day.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   Yep.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.320]   This is for the guys who are working 18 hours a day in the hell hole offices in cubicles
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   of San Francisco.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   They can't get out to eat.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   They need their food delivered.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   I would do it.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.480]   It's a sweatshop.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.320]   I would rather go look at the fruits and vegetables myself.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.040]   But you're that kind of person.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.640]   You saw the video on 60 Minutes.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.360]   The woman was that she was picking the fruits and vegetables.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.440]   Carefully going through it, stripping off.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   Sure, sure they are.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   The genius of it is in addition to perishable items like fish and things like that, you
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   can get electronics and books.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   Can you?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440]   It's all part of the same.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.920]   Yeah, you get a baguette and a fish and an iPhone.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   Sounds delicious.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.080]   It's free delivery on orders of $35 or more.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.240]   That's why you pay $300 for the membership.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.040]   You also get a prime membership with it.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.680]   Oh, that's delicious.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.440]   San Francisco shouldn't get too excited.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.200]   It's only covering 12 of the 51 zip codes within the city.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Aha.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   So a tiny minority of lucky.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.680]   But wasn't this the problem?
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.800]   You know what I mean is not out in the sun, says not where people live, it's where people
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   work.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   Probably.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   For all these poor, short clubs.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.840]   You can get a tasty apple pie from Three Babes Bakeshop.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   Wow.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.040]   I would love an apple pie.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.200]   Well, a fresh salmon from the San Francisco.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.600]   I might just move to San Francisco.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   A salmon.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.880]   And they have a mobile app that will do this.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.400]   This is a fresh is it a real salmon or a farm salmon with a white goo.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.880]   Who comes out and if salmon stinks, that's a problem with most salmon.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.440]   I can't stand salmon from around here.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.880]   Oh, is an optimist hits you on the head with a purse?
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   Let's see.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   What happened there?
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.880]   He got hit in the head.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   Yes, that's a bad man.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.880]   Don D.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.960]   So I got hit in the head and hockey puck, by the way.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   A hockey puck.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.000]   And now I can play five musical instruments.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Were you in a shark's game?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Where did you get it on the head?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It's a long story.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.640]   Well, it's not really worth talking about.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   Okay.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.120]   So I like the idea of doing this.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.080]   But you're right, we saw it with P pod, which was Safeway's service.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.360]   I think that's still around.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.000]   Web van went out of business.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.880]   It's hard to do, I think, economically.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.760]   I think the economics of it are difficult.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.880]   But I guess what they do is they say the $2.99 are profit.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   Right?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.640]   I mean, part of the part of the issue that Amazon is facing is that they actually sell,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.240]   they sell less in terms of revenue than Costco and any of these other stores, partly because
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   when you buy from Amazon, get a pass.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   We're going to say that again.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.600]   They make less revenue.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.800]   Yeah, they sell fewer products or less revenue than the target.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   Or order.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   No, in general.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   In general.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   There's light margins.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   Part, yeah.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.040]   And a big reason is when you go to Costco, you're leaving with a car full of stuff.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.440]   $500 worth of toilet paper that I don't need.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   Exactly.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.240]   When you buy something from Amazon, it's going to be a little box.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.320]   It's one thing or a couple of things.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   And so there's not-
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.760]   That's not economical for them.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Exactly.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.400]   So they're trying to come up with ways to make it economical for you to order a Costco-sized
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   load of junk or food or whatever it is you're going to get.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.080]   And they're experimenting with all kinds of ways to do that.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:53.800]   They say that they have 500,000 items available through this project.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.920]   That's the problem with Subscribing Save, which I do use.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.320]   That's a service that Amazon has had for some time that no one knows about it.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.040]   They don't even put it on the front page.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.880]   And you get like five or 10% off because you're ordering it on a regular basis.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.600]   But it's really kind of embarrassing to have a box that is really the size you could put
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.040]   a pony in and it's just filled with toilet paper is kind of embarrassing.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.840]   I got a box the other day from Amazon that had a little bitty thing inside a giant box.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   Every time.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   What a waste.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.440]   I think they're running out of- they have too many big boxes.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   And so they put little things-
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.440]   There's just dumping it off.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.440]   You've got a micro SD card and it came in this gigantic-
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.440]   Yeah, that happened.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   It really makes me mad.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   And that happened.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   It's like not always.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   Sometimes the box is the right size for the product.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.240]   So you get this huge box.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   You think they're just clearing out the stuff?
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.000]   I think they're clearing out the stock of boxes.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.960]   Here's the other part that makes it more economical though.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   In addition to delivering things they'll also pick things up.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.480]   So if you want to return something to Amazon they'll pick it up.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.960]   That means that Amazon can sort of collectivize their-
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   Oh, they're already-
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   They're already out in their-
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.120]   Yeah, if you return something to Amazon they have to pay for the shipping, right?
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.240]   So drop it off of the truck.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.000]   Well, this is interesting John because they're about to apparently, according to USA Today,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.880]   which Amazon pantry, if you're an Amazon Prime member you can buy packaged goods in
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.400]   a set size box with a maximum weight limit.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.800]   So you're paying for the box?
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.000]   Pantry's- I don't understand.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.240]   So this is another part of the strategy to compete with the cost goes of the world.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   They're trying to-
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   What they do is they say-
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.840]   Paper goods, canned goods.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   Right.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.640]   They want to have a maximum limit.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.280]   So it's the same price no matter how much up to the limit.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.440]   So they're trying to incentivize you to maximize the number of things you buy, right?
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   Because the shipping's the same price.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.760]   You pay for those when you buy that prepaid box.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   Right.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   You tend to stuff it full of stuff.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   You stuff it full of everything.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Here's some rocks, whatever.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.240]   By the way, this hasn't been announced yet.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.240]   This is-
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   This is a leak.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.320]   But it's supposedly going to, you know, all anonymous sources going to launch next year.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.840]   Two thousand items, not a giant selection.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.960]   But wait a minute, I don't get it.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.600]   Am I paying a flat rate for the box or do I pay for the goods in the box?
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.360]   You pay for the goods in the box, but the shipping part of it is the same.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:10.480]   And yet another problem that Amazon has compared with Costco in these places is you're
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.080]   not going to buy paper towels and stuff like that from Amazon.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   It's not-
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   It's like a pretty good item.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.360]   But this invites you to get everyday frivolous items in addition to the other things you're
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.600]   ordering because they make it economically viable for the consumer.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   So they're really just trying to-
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.560]   They're trying to get everybody to quadruple the number of things they buy from Amazon
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.560]   and you know-
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.560]   This is a big market.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.080]   $850 billion a year market according to the USA today.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   The packaged goods market.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.440]   So, but if I'm an Amazon Prime member, I'm already getting free shipping.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.480]   So there's no incentive for me to take advantage of this.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.600]   Well, I believe this, according to these sources, it's only going to be for Amazon Prime.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.400]   So in addition to everything else, it's an incentive to join Amazon Prime for people
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   who want this service.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   Well, I-
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   But I don't pay shipping on it today.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   So this is something faster?
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   Same day?
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   Yeah, I mean the details on this are sketchy and I-
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   It's probably unlikely that Amazon has even finalized those kinds of details.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.960]   You know, there's a whole lot we don't know about this.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.000]   All we know is that an omnisources are claiming that this is all happening.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.400]   You know, buy canned goods, John?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.400]   Yeah, I go to the store and buy canned goods.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.240]   You mocked and sound like you were mocking.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.400]   Well, why would anyone ship get-
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.240]   This is like Petco, where PetS.com and they were shipping dog food.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   Right.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.240]   Well, what-
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   Worse kitty litter.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   They were shipping clay.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.

[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.

[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   And then they were shipping dogs.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   And he called somebody who is not known as a Microsoft Apologist.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   In fact, she hasn't been led on the campus in some time because they're worried about
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   the scoops that she gets.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   Nevertheless, she's always said that she likes Steve Balmer.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   And he's a very likable guy, actually.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   Yeah, he feels like he's like a salesman.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   Like you would, you know, that's what he does.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   Right?
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   He's like a glad handler.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   He's a glad handler, yes.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   She said that one of the things she learned about him, this is not the most important.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   Well, no, it might be the most interesting.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   It has nothing to do with Microsoft.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   He remember he never forgets a shoe.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   Sorry?
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   So if he meets you, if he meets you, he will remember, I think it's a salesman trick.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   He'll remember you by your shoes.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   He can tell you what the footwear was of anybody he's met in the last 20 years.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.240]   I find this hard to believe, I think, is bull crap.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   But if it's true, that is a salesman.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   It seems like it isn't.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   Yeah, it's one of the things.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   He'll just give you a hush puppies.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Something like that.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   He also says that there's your pervert, his son's a possibility.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   You're both.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   Well, and this is the other thing Mary Jo told me that I said, well, what was he wearing?
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.240]   You know, trademark khakis and dress open collar dress shirt.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   He comes in the room, takes off his shoes.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   Because he doesn't want anyone remembering them.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   And puts his feet up, his socks feet up on the table.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   Really?
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   Yeah, I hope he washes a lot.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   That sounds pleasant to me.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   I don't want to.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   I don't want to like that now.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   You know, it's the usual.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   I have regrets, but I don't like to look backward.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   I have to go forward.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   Don't forget, I tripled Microsoft's profits in my tenure.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   I, you know, I introduced things like the Xbox.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   They had her.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   It was interesting.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Had her interview Robbie Bach, who's no longer at Microsoft, before she talked to, and Microsoft
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   Council, what's his name, Fred, before she talked to Bomber.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.720]   And then afterwards, she talked to Sacha Nadella, who is one of the people rumored to be a
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.240]   candidate for CEO.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   And I just, it feels like it was very orchestrated.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   Francis X Shaw, the Microsoft PR guys in the room during this interview.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   Yeah, of course.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   You know, just in case, like his case, he has to do some damage control afterwards.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.240]   Very common.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   Yeah, these guys never get to meet alone.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   No.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   Anyway, good on Mary Jo for getting in.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   She had a lot of interesting insights.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.880]   She talked about Steve Bomber's business, you know, five rules for good business.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.240]   What is this five rules for good business?
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   Let me find it.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   Let me find it.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   Always remember the shoes.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   Show us, yeah.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   We're gonna share shoes.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.120]   You know, he talks about increasing profits and all that kind of stuff.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.480]   I don't think he really wants to go there because if you look at the valuation of the
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.880]   company from the point he took over, he took over, I think, a month after they shattered
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.960]   the record for evaluation of a company.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.880]   And since then, it's now a fraction of what it used to be.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.520]   So I don't think he's, you know, from a purely financial point of view, I don't think he's
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.680]   been successful.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.240]   He's probably been the least successful CEO in history.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   Really?
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   That's because...
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   In part.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   That is very hard.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   Well, I don't buy it.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.400]   Well, given the competition, if you look at what Google and Apple have accomplished over
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.560]   the last few years, where they, this huge company, and instead of peaking and then dying,
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.160]   they get huger and huger, right?
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   They just keep...
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.080]   There's a juggernaut and they've been able to reinvent themselves several times.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.720]   Microsoft can speakuously been unable to do that.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.080]   They haven't reinvented themselves and they've missed everything.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.560]   Is that Palmer's fault?
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   Well, he's the CEO.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   Why isn't it his fault?
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.800]   Yeah, but Gates is still calling the shots.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.120]   Well, he's the chairman and they talk a lot.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.560]   That's another problem that they have.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.800]   Bill Gates ought to be throwing off the board to...
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.000]   There's a strong rumor that Bill will in fact be off the...
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.520]   He's the chairman of the board of Microsoft.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.480]   He'll be off the board when the new CEO comes in.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.440]   They want to do a clean sweep and really give them all the new guy a chance.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.160]   I don't know who they're going to hire to be honest.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.880]   His biggest mistake is protecting Palmer.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.880]   I think in a normal company, Palmer wouldn't have survived.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.960]   He did protect Palmer.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   He did.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.960]   Absolutely.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.400]   It's pretty obvious, even reading between the lines of what Gates said when Palmer announced
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.960]   his retirement, it's pretty obvious that every time the long knives came out for Palmer,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.600]   Steve said, "No, no, he's my guy."
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.160]   And Gates said, "You said Steve."
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   Steve Gates.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   I mean, Bill's brother.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   I think about it.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   If you're at Microsoft, if you're on the Microsoft board...
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.160]   I'm telling that lately.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   Oh?
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.160]   Yeah, Bob.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   I called you Bob.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   I don't know.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   I just harassed your...
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   Overworked?
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   Overworked and underpaid.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.160]   Underpaid?
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   Well, I just don't overworked.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.680]   No, I was just saying, if you're on the Microsoft board, you don't fire Bill Gates's college roommate.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   No, that's right.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.240]   I don't think they were roommates, were they?
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   Yeah, you were right.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   You were right.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   You were right.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   Don't go home.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   Poker buddies.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   Close nearby.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.440]   But he bought a quantitative, which they had to write down $6.2 billion.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   That was a huge blend.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.320]   Five years later.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.200]   The Microsoft Kin.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   The Kin was ridiculous.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.360]   They bought danger to make the Kin.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.120]   I don't get the Kin.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.200]   For one thing, they bring the thing out.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.040]   I saw one, finally.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.200]   And I said, "Well, that's kind of cute.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.560]   I can see kids liking this thing.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   It's pretty simple.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   It's not a big deal."
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.360]   And then they pulled it within weeks of...
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   You know, why?
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.200]   You had to buy a full-fledged data plan.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   Nobody's gonna...
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.760]   The Kin's cute for kids, but nobody's gonna pay an $80 a month or $90 a day plan for junior.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   They could change that.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.800]   They should have changed that, but they didn't.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   And it just killed...
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   They're locked in on some kind.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   Sure, it had to do with the stupid companies.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   The cellular companies.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   I'm...
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.600]   I can't find the five reasons that he's like...
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.800]   I saw this before, and I don't know if...
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   Maybe you're very good.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.200]   So Mary Jo wrote the article as a special to Fortune, but then she's got more coverage
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   on her ZD net blogs.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.640]   And let me go to all about Microsoft.com.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   I don't know of others.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.920]   I imagine others will also get this chance to talk to him.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.520]   Here it is.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.240]   Let's see bombers five management tips.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   You ready?
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   I'm ready.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   Leo, what's number one?
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   Number one.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   Make sure developers...
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   Developers.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.240]   Make sure you see the whole playing field.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   What's he talking about?
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   Football?
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   Is this some...
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   You know how...
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   You know how CEOs are.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.080]   They really like to use football metaphors.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   Yes.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   Okay.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.080]   Well...
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   That's what plays the baseball...
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   What he's...
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   What he's saying is don't...
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.960]   And you know, some CEOs are micromanagers, right?
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.160]   He's saying your job is CEO.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.320]   You mean like Bill Gates?
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.320]   Was he a micromanager?
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   I think so.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   So is Ballmer to some extent.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.880]   Well, Satya Nadella said, "Make sure if you come in with something to talk about...
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.440]   Bill with, you better have the details."
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.760]   These very detail focus.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.240]   That sounds like a little bit like...
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   Well, so what...
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   The screen went blank.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.720]   Well, it's loading.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   Wow.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   So number two.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.120]   It'll be there any second.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.960]   Make sure you look at the shoes.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   I don't know.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   Here it is.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   Cheers.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   Hello.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.400]   See the big picture of the CEO doesn't see the playing field nobody else can.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.080]   The team may need to see it too.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.440]   Why with the football analogies?
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.440]   Why?
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.440]   It's ludicrous.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.760]   10 years from now, will devices look the same as they look today or quite different?
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.400]   He apparently didn't know the answer.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.760]   Yes, I guess not.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   No.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   Talent.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   This is number two.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   Number two.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   Talent is only one...
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   This is all crap.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.760]   One part of success.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   That's his tip.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   That's the tip.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.360]   What kind of a tip is that?
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   Not even a tip.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360]   It's an affive.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.240]   I thought talent was two parts of success.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   It's kind of a...
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   It's incredible.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   An insight.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   Could be one, could be two.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   Okay, let's go to three.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   Skip that.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   Reevaluate, reevaluate, reevaluate.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   I think...
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.480]   I think they just made this stuff up.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   You know.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.040]   Let me think.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.320]   Number four.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.560]   Bet for the short term and...
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.560]   The long term.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   Wow.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   Sometimes people think...
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.920]   You should bet on one or the other but you could...
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   You should bet on one.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.160]   I gotta write that one down.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.920]   You should reevaluate that one.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   I really think that...
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   Reevaluate, reevaluate, reevaluate.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   Three times.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   Wow.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.200]   All right, what's the last one?
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.920]   Know your limits.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.080]   Something I've never heard before.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   He says I...
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   He's really come out of off the wall with this stuff.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.720]   Obviously, he said, "Understand the business stuff better than the technology stuff."
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   That's kind of an admission.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   I would say...
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.400]   Because I know Ballmer doesn't even know how to use a computer.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   What?
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.400]   Well, I just said I'd never seen him use one.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.200]   I mean, isn't Microsoft his second job?
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   What's his first job?
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   Proctor and Gamble.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   I think he was a proctor and Gamble.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   He was a marketing guy.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Oh, his second job ever.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.880]   Well, the office that he met Mary Jo in, which is supposedly his office, has no desk, no
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   computer.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   There you have it.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   Just a bunch of sofas.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.880]   There you have it.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.880]   I'm just saying I haven't seen him use a computer.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   I'm not...
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.520]   I don't know that he doesn't know how to use one.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.640]   He says, "But I've grown.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:25.480]   And when you grow, you say, 'Wow, I didn't know what I didn't know.'"
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   That should be number six.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.600]   Unbelievable.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.000]   We sold 191 now.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   That's...
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.120]   Yeah, he's got this thing on a speed dial thing guy.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.280]   He clicks over to this page.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.280]   He wants his young lady.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   Whee!
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   For Leo.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   Leo, Bobblehead, though.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:47.160]   Now, there's only 59 more last chance.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   He's playing teespring.com/twit.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.840]   He's gonna be sold before the end of the show, A, and now there'll be...
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.400]   People will be irked.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.240]   The people that listen to the podcast, as a podcast, by downloading it, are gonna be
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.040]   irked as hell.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.040]   We broke the mold.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.040]   Got to watch live, man.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.680]   Sorry, we broke the mold.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.240]   Let's talk about Instagram, the new Instagram messaging.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:15.680]   We'll talk about why Nokia is making an Android phone, and why Twitter changed how blocking
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   works.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.000]   It's all coming up in just a bit.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.400]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at audible.com.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.120]   If you're an audiobook lover, like I am, you know audible.com.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   It really is.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.840]   I don't think there's any competition anymore.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.920]   It is the audiobook store, 150,000 Audible Books online.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   Classics, like The Wizard of Oz, read by Anne Hathaway.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.760]   Our friend Leanne Arconi's Johnny Ive, the genius behind the man who made the iPod and
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   the internet.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   That is a great book, by the way.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.760]   Have you read it?
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   I have.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:55.480]   He tried and tried to get Johnny to talk, but he got his friends to, but he couldn't get
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   Johnny.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480]   Not just his friends.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:03.680]   He went back to his old design school professors and all kinds of things.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.160]   It's just a really good, solid book with tons of detail.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.800]   You think you know absolutely everything about Apple, and this book is completely packed
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.600]   with juicy insights.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.840]   I have to say that's one category I read a lot of on Audible is the inside stories on
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   technology.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.680]   I've just got Nick Bilton's hatching Twitter, just really juicy.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.280]   Fred Vogelstein's a new book Dog Fight, about the war between Apple and Google.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.680]   These are all inaudible.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.160]   But sometimes you know you got to take a break.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.680]   You want a little relaxation.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.160]   Maybe you want to listen a little fiction.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.160]   The new John Grisham.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.000]   Is that what you're listening to Lisa Sycamore-Roe?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I think so.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You got the new John Grisham.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Wow, that's good.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I like that.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.160]   I like that in kind of this southern style.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.320]   The thing I love about Audible is the readers.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.840]   They get the best actors who bring these books to life.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.080]   It's like a movie in your mind, Michael Beck.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   Hanging oneself from a tree are not that simple.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.040]   Evidently Seth thought of everything.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.080]   The rope was three quarter inch braided natural.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.640]   People will perhaps think when you listen to audio books, it's somehow hard to follow.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   You'll be amazed.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.120]   That's why I want you to get a book right now free because you'll be amazed.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.840]   It really draws you in.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.800]   Pretty soon you don't even know you're listening to a book.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.960]   You just feel like you're in this great world.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.400]   The reason this is so good is because it transforms your long commute.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.720]   Those hours spent in the treadmill at the gym, walking the dog, washing the dishes.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.200]   I love Audible.com.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.360]   We've arranged a two book trial for you.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:34.920]   If you go to Audible.com/twit2, you'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.960]   That means two books a month, but your first month's free, your first two books are free
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.640]   and you can cancel anytime and at least in the first 30 days, pay nothing, but you're
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.160]   going to keep those books.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.640]   I suspect you won't cancel.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.280]   There's so many.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.000]   Science fiction is great here.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   History.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.440]   I've read all of the Robert Caro books about Lyndon Johnson.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.880]   It's a whole series called The Years of Lyndon Johnson.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.520]   I say read, but really I've listened to them on Audible.com, the path to power, the means
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.240]   of a cent, master of the senate.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:09.840]   These are books about the brilliant books about how to wield and how to gain and wield political
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.840]   power.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.960]   There was no one, no greater master than Lyndon Johnson.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.320]   I just love this stuff.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.960]   Biography, history.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   Get your books.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.760]   Go to those two books free.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.280]   You'll also get the free subscription to The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   Daily Audio.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.200]   You can listen to that.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.320]   This is a really great deal.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.880]   Kids books too, young adult books.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:36.680]   This is a great way to get your kids into books by listening together a dog named Christmas.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   Aww, by Greg Kincaid.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.400]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.280]   We thank them for their support.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.680]   If you missed any of Twit this week, you missed quite a bit.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   Let's take a look.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:55.200]   Previously on Twit, Windows Weekly, you got a massive scoop this week.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   This may be the last interview Steve Palmer ever gives and you've got it.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.440]   When I talked to him, I felt like he's at peace now with the decision to move forward.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.240]   The Verge is Tom Warren reports that Normandy would run a forked version of Android.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.120]   Will it be released since Microsoft will take control of Nokia's handset operations?
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.240]   I'd wager against that.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:37.440]   Did he not inspire you to start Reddit, right?
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:54.240]   Tom Merritt is here with a look at the week ahead, Tom.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.520]   Here's a look at the week ahead and some of the things will be keeping an eye on on tech
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.520]   news to date.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.720]   Not too much happening as we get close to the holidays.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.400]   Wednesday, December 18th.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.240]   Oracle has their earnings report.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.760]   Friday, December 20th.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.360]   Goodbye to win app.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   That's the official day.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   It's discontinued.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.440]   Also on the 20th, Merry Christmas.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   It's black.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   Berry earnings time.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.880]   And look down the road.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.560]   Don't forget CES kicks off on January 7th.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.440]   That's a look at the weeks ahead.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.600]   Back to you Leo.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   Thanks Tom.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   Yeah, we're going to have Father Robert Ballister.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.280]   The Gizwiz Dick D Bartolo will be at CES.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   Who else?
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.480]   I'll be at New Media Expo.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.960]   We'll be keynoting on Monday.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.840]   Chad's going to go to CES.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   We have a few people.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.840]   No?
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   Carsten.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.840]   Carsten's going to see us.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.160]   So we will have CES coverage also on this network.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.560]   We're not doing the big booth this year.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.840]   You haven't done the big booth for a while.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   Two years.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   It was expensive.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.280]   You know who's doing the big booth this year?
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   Who?
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.920]   Callie Lewis with Geekbeat and imore.com or name Richie will be there.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.320]   So it's like four or five tech blogs are uniting to take over.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   The giant big booth.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.520]   The South Hall big booth.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   Fascinating.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.520]   I feel like CES is not.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.840]   I'm not going.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   You always say that.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.720]   I generally don't go.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   I did go once in a while.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.120]   I get suckered once in a while to going.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120]   But I generally don't like going.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.880]   It's a stupid show.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   There's no.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880]   It's over covered.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   There's over covered.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.880]   That's the real problem.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.040]   It's really way over covered.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.120]   I don't think we need to go.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.280]   What we're going to do, we've decided is there's got to be a cut off.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.880]   There's like a certain number of products that are worth covering.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.520]   10, 20, 30, 50.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.920]   It's fewer than 100.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.760]   So we're just going to pick the top, whatever.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.000]   50 things that you want to see.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.640]   It might be 10.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.160]   It'll be TVs, of course.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.800]   But there's so many Apple accessories.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   Who cares what iPhone, iPad covers and stuff.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.520]   So we're going to pick the top whatever X number of products and just show you those
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.840]   and say that's it.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.080]   Nothing else mattered.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.200]   That's anything below this line.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   Who cares?
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.920]   I think that's arrogant.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.600]   Well, like because I'm setting myself up as the arbiter of what's good and what's not.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.120]   Probably some poor little guy that if you would just give him some attention, it would put
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.280]   him over the top.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.600]   He'd be successful.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.840]   His wife would love him.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.440]   The whole thing would go well.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.800]   But no, you decided to go with Samsung products.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.000]   But that's the pro.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.480]   No, they don't.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.680]   That's the irony.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.960]   There's the thousands of these tech journalists and they all go to the same two booths.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.200]   It's ridiculous.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   You know, it was funny.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.720]   It uses an example last year.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   Happy Fork, which was that vibrating fork, the haptic feedback fork because it was happy
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   fork.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:44.800]   Yeah, because it was right inside the door at CES Unveiled, which was the first event
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.680]   on Sunday and there wasn't much else good there.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.880]   They got massive coverage on ABC, NBC, CBS, USA, to every tech blog.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.640]   We gave him 10 minutes on a vibrating fork.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.600]   You're right.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   It's arbitrary.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   It's stupid.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.320]   What else are we going to do?
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.480]   I have no idea.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.160]   I have no help for you because I'm not going.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   I don't care.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   You're not going at all.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   Talk about arrogant.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.160]   Yep.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   Totally.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:16.200]   Let's talk about this weird rumor that Nokia, it wasn't surprising that before the acquisition
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.560]   Nokia at least threatened to make an Android phone.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.600]   In fact, I wish they would.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:26.160]   I think if we get the Lumia 1020 or the 1520 on Android, I'd hop on it.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.160]   Great hardware.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.640]   It's not that there's anything wrong with Windows phone.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.720]   It's just that I want to use Android.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.880]   First of all, it has to be said that this is another anonymous sources kind of thing.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.880]   Yeah, there's a lot of this.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.360]   And when it comes to upcoming products, everyone needs to understand that it's often
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.720]   very difficult for anonymous sources to know the difference between something that's a
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.720]   little pet project that's going nowhere and something that's the future of the company.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:55.640]   Now, this is something that the Verge reported, but Ena Freed, who's got very good sources,
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.600]   confirmed it from her sources.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.840]   It gives us some credence.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   It exists.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:07.480]   I don't doubt that Normandy, which is the code name for this project, exists.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.160]   The question is, is it just a hedge of whatever?
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.920]   So having said that, it's an interesting project.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.880]   I personally think Microsoft would be very wise to allow an Android phone built by the
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   -- Why not?
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.720]   They make five bucks in Android hands.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   Exactly.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.720]   Exactly.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.520]   They would be making Microsoft products that support Android.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.800]   I mean, they did it for Apple for years and years.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   I mean, why not?
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.160]   Microsoft's in an unusual position.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:41.400]   We're going to get back to the Microsoft conversation because people are roundly critical of Windows
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   8.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.960]   In fact, Mary, Joan, and Paul have both confirmed the next version of Windows, which is code
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.880]   named Threshold, will bring back the start menu.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.240]   In effect, Microsoft's saying the real start menu is fake.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.240]   Not the button.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.560]   The real start menu that they have now.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.040]   So they tried it with Windows 8.1.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.760]   They brought the start button, which is a fake.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   Yeah, this is the button.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   Doesn't do anything.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.000]   So apparently, and many sources are confirming this, and it may happen sooner than the next
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   edition of Windows.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.680]   They might even do it in an update soon.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.720]   They're going to put the menu back.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.760]   You mean the menu you get when you use the --
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   When you use Windows 7?
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.360]   No, when you use Classic Shell on Windows 8, you get the menu back.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   Or you ever start it?
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   It's a great problem.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.160]   And apparently, I think this is a response to business customers who are saying, "We're
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   not going to retrain our employees."
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.200]   So you can go into the future with your tablet interface.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   We need a start menu.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.200]   Right.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   Phone interface.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   It's something there's a phone interface.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   Exactly.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   Well, I mean, everybody's grappling with this.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:38.720]   And if you look at OS 10, they've been sneaking tablet-like and phone-like, multi-touch type
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   things into the --
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   Much more judicious.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.360]   Much jud -- yeah, it's off the corner.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.960]   I don't have to use it.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.400]   They're also sort of pushing the hardware into it.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.440]   They've had these touch pads that sort of -- or like tablet-like.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   Who?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Apple?
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   They're a little -- what do they call it?
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.440]   The track pad.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.240]   And so the gesture, they actually reversed one of the gestures to make it more phone-like
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.840]   so that when you scroll up, it goes up and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   I hate that.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:08.080]   It's -- they're trying to -- everybody is trying to bring the world from the WIMP user interface,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:14.160]   Windows icons, menus, and pointing devices, to the post-PC touch, multi-touch interface.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.400]   And it's very, very difficult to do because everybody's sort of brains have been programmed.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:25.040]   Well, people over the age of 30, our brains have been programmed to use WIMP, you know,
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.600]   mice and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.040]   And so how do you make that transition without going out of business?
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   Right.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   This is what Microsoft is struggling with.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.000]   And they did a half-hearted effort with the whole Metro UI.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.360]   Why make the transition?
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   Who cares?
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.360]   Who wanted this?
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.360]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.800]   Do you think the 12-year-olds who have used nothing but iPads and iPhones will ever use
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   a mouse.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.480]   They will never, ever use a mouse.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.680]   And it'll seem like a clunky Victorian contraption to them.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.840]   We are going to a world that's going to be full-screen.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.640]   Desktop computers will be touch.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:00.560]   I can assure you, touch voice, a combination of user inputs.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   And everybody knows it.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Microsoft knows it, Apple knows it.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   Nobody knows it.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   This is bull crap.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.640]   No, there's no question about it that we're going in that direction.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.560]   And we're going in that direction, but I don't think anybody --
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.400]   But not because somebody wanted it.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.400]   I'm not -- do you like it?
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.000]   You -- or you see, you're always on top of the -- so you're like it.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   You're using a tablet.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   You're using a tablet.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.760]   You went to tablet immediately.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.520]   But I -- I have a big screen, a big 27-inch screen.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   I got two of them.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.520]   I can't deal with this full-screen app.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.520]   It's showing up.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.400]   It's like it scares you when it comes up.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.880]   Well, the interfaces are -- are -- are letters of this big?
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.800]   Well, I mean, that's -- but that's a flaw.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.880]   I mean, it sounds like you work for Fox News.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.880]   But this is a flaw.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.860]   Does it sound like -- you're worried -- No, because Fox News has the biggest --
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:43.860]   Oh, big monitors.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:49.660]   And the icons are the size of a paperback book or something like that.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:50.660]   I mean, they're enormous.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.660]   And that's just awful.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.560]   Aren't we in a post-PC world, John?
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.560]   No.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.980]   I think we're in a -- we stabilized world that they predicted before 1990 -- before 1990 -- I'm
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.620]   sorry, before 1995 when Windows 95 came out.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.340]   I think we're in that replacement era.
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:05.860]   Everybody's got a PC.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.660]   And there is no post-PC era.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   Because nobody wants it.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.660]   But everybody's got it.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.660]   You don't need it.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   I don't need it.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.820]   I've got a machine that's been running like a champ for the last seven years because, again,
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.380]   Moore's Law, as we mentioned earlier, doesn't really apply to software.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.980]   So we got all this old crap.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.900]   I mean, Microsoft Word, what have they done in the last decade?
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.700]   Except it spelled my -- It's ridiculous.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.820]   They could do all kinds of things where it could write for you.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.660]   It could really do some grammar work, a sentence of the crazy -- Oh, it's a -- it's a passive
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.180]   sentence change that was really terrible.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.980]   It's just ludicrous.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.980]   But my kids -- My kids.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.980]   My kids.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   The ribbon bar don't get me started.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.460]   Eighteen-year-old and 21-year-old used computers, used laptops.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.460]   No interest in iPads.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.460]   None.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.500]   So that generation, maybe they missed it.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.740]   I mean, our generation seems to be taken to iPads.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.460]   Young, young kids, two-year-old, five-year-old, little kids love iPads, right?
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.460]   Sure.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   But are they going to grow up and want desktops?
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.460]   Or are they going to even want desktops?
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.100]   Or are they going to grow up to desk -- To grown up machines?
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.340]   You mean like a desktop?
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.340]   Of course, they're going to have to.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.780]   You can't do a lot of things that you can do efficiently.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:12.620]   And there's not enough hours in the day to dick around, point and squeeze in --
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.380]   Shepherd Smith's Big S tablets.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.380]   Those things.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.380]   Yeah, that was unbelievable.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.860]   It's not about grown-ups and children.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:23.900]   As much as it is about -- If you look at the whole history of computer user interfaces,
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.460]   it's all about machines evolving to become more sophisticated and powerful so that the
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.260]   user does less work and interacts with this thing like it does the real world.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.580]   Computer interfaces are never going to stop evolving until it's just like the real world.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.900]   Until where the piece of paper is a piece of paper on screen, you have objects that you're
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.900]   moving around.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.900]   But we're a long way from that.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.900]   We're not that far away.
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.420]   If you look at that, you can drop all this crap and go back to a piece of paper.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.420]   It works fine.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.700]   Well, it's not just paper.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.700]   The big user interface of the near future that's already coming online is voice.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.700]   I do like voice.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.700]   Look at Voice Command, how far it's come in the last few years and how ubiquitous it's
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.700]   become.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.700]   Listen to this.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.260]   This is a new robot telemarketer time magazine.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.460]   Zeke Miller and Denver Nix.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.620]   Is it named Rachel?
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:19.980]   Well, maybe you've even gotten these robocalls because they sound like a human.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.380]   Her name is Samantha West.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:27.460]   Listen to this recording from Time Reporters.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.940]   They're calling her back.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.140]   Hello, how are you today?
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.540]   I don't hear a thing.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:37.380]   Can you turn up the way you're in the studio, Mike, or a speaker?
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.380]   Good.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:42.620]   Calling about an online request you once made about health insurance coverage.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:46.500]   We work with all major companies and compare all the rates for you.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.580]   I can get you a quote in about five minutes, okay?
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.100]   Are you a robot?
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.580]   I am a real person.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.940]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:00.100]   I can hear you just fine, but you sound like a robot.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.100]   I understand.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.500]   Ah, right away.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.340]   Can we continue?
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.340]   Sure.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.740]   Are you currently on Medicare?
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:13.780]   No, why are the questions so personal?
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.380]   We received your online application for health insurance.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.380]   This is pretty smart though.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.860]   This is really good.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   Outstanding.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.740]   We can give you a free quote.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:27.380]   Why should I give my information to you?
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.380]   There's a delay there.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.380]   The delay is too long.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.100]   I understand, but we do work with all carriers and I can get you a low rate.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.100]   Getting a quote will only take a minute, okay?
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.100]   Who produced this?
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.100]   You really do sound like a robot.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:42.460]   Well, it sounds standing to me.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.460]   Banking.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.140]   I am a real person.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.140]   Maybe we have a better question.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.140]   Why is it lying to us?
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.140]   I know.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.140]   It's awful.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.140]   It's lying.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.140]   It's not only lying.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   If it's nasty about it.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.060]   And obviously whatever deal you're going to give you is going to be a scam.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.060]   It's not only lying.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.060]   It's nasty about it.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.780]   She's like, I am a real person.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.020]   And it's like crazy.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.180]   She's having an attitude.
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.340]   They programmed an attitude in this thing.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.340]   Okay.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:05.340]   I'm a major company.
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.100]   Hey, are you a robot?
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.100]   What?
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.300]   No, I am a real person.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.300]   What?
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:14.300]   Do you have a bad connection?
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.300]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   That's the most ridiculous thing she's ever heard.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.060]   You just sound so much like a robot.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:20.620]   I am a real person.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.780]   Maybe we have a bad connection.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.340]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.900]   Will you tell me you're not a robot?
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.660]   Just say I'm not a robot, please.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.300]   I am a real person.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.660]   I mean, I believe you.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:38.700]   But when you just say I'm not a robot, it'll make me feel better to hear you say it.
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.700]   I love the laugh.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.020]   There is a live person here.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.020]   But I know there is.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:49.980]   It would just make me feel so much better to hear you say I am not a robot.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:55.700]   If you could say the words I'm not a robot, it would really mean a lot to me.
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.220]   I am a real person.
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.420]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.860]   Yeah, I can hear you fine.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.860]   I just want to hear you say it.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.180]   It goes on much the same.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:07.820]   He never gets you to say I'm not a robot because it's not recorded.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.460]   But next time, there may be no have that.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.860]   Well, that's one of the things you do.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.700]   You test these things and you see what kind of ridicule you face.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:22.020]   But the real point to me is they are lying to the public when they say I'm a real person.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.220]   That means this is a disreputable company.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.220]   There you go.
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.300]   They're lying to you straight up.
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.900]   She should say, "Yes, I'm a robot.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.740]   Now would you like to buy some insurance?"
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:31.740]   It's that would be better.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.500]   It's worse than just lying.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.700]   It's premeditated lying.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.660]   They programmed lying into the system on purpose.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:41.140]   They had a whole meeting about it and said, "Yeah, what if they say, 'Are you a robot?
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.660]   What are we going to say?'
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:43.660]   We're going to lie.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.660]   Have the lady record.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:50.580]   These things, but clearly this kind of stuff is going to get really good and that's going
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.140]   to become a problem.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.380]   I think I'm predicting that within a few years they're going to have to make them deliberately
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.340]   bad because sales like things like this, they're trolling for suckers.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.700]   They're trolling for people who are gullible.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700]   That's the target market.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.380]   It's not like an old drunk is what they should do.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.380]   Yes.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.380]   Hey, what do you want?
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.380]   Hey.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.380]   I'm not a robot.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.380]   What are you talking about?
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.380]   It would work.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.660]   Because you get belligerent, then people are going to back down.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   Yeah, they could win.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.660]   You should get belligerent.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.100]   What are you calling me a robot?
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.180]   What they could do if they really wanted to be creepy is they could mine your social
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.340]   networking activity and tell you things personally about what you're doing.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.340]   Oh, I'm sure they're doing that.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.340]   I'm in the house.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.340]   Did you see there a study came out.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:35.980]   I mean, I was watching a Facebook researcher talking about stuff you started writing on
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   Facebook but canceled.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.980]   Yes.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.100]   Apparently, Facebook is not only giving track of everything you post on Facebook but everything
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.940]   you write but decide not to post on Facebook.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.060]   And they want to know why you didn't post it.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.140]   Like now they're like at that level where they're like, "Oh gosh, why didn't they post
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.140]   these things?"
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.140]   I'm telling you, these things are nasty.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.140]   I would stay off Facebook.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.140]   I would give up my account immediately.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.140]   Like you have done.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.140]   Oh, that's what you went back.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.060]   No, I went back because, but it's my job if I were a normal person.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.220]   If I were not a tech journalist, I would not be on Facebook.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:05.220]   And increasingly, I find Facebook extremely annoying because they're manipulating the
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.220]   feed.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.500]   The newest thing Facebook is doing, and this happened after the Twitter IPO.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.940]   I think Facebook said we want to start being a news source.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.460]   Facebook lives in, I think Mark Zuckerberg's personality is looking over at the other guy
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.020]   saying, "No, I want to do that."
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.300]   Because everything that's happened with Facebook is him saying, "No, I want to be more like
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.300]   Twitter.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.060]   No, I want to be more like Google."
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.140]   It's almost as if they can't figure out what to do on their own.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:33.260]   So their newest thing is, let's make the feed more newsworthy.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:38.980]   So, the news feed is not everything your friends post.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:44.940]   It's stuff your friends post that the algorithm deems newsworthy and the rest is just tossed.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.740]   They have a confusing strategy.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.500]   I mean, Google's approach is to really try to understand everything about you and serve
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:58.340]   up a combination of a very custom stream of news and also a thing that is supposed to
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.820]   be the best stuff.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.900]   Facebook seems to be going at this in a very generic kind of way.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.940]   They don't seem to have the mastery over their algorithms that Google does.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:12.660]   And so they're trying to say, "Okay, we want to tamper down the frivolous buzzfeed type
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.940]   stuff and turn up the important stories."
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.780]   And I'm not sure that that's what Facebook people really wanted to do.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.260]   Do you want to see what our friends and family are up to?
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.260]   Exactly.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.220]   If you look at what's actually shared on Facebook, it's a lot of fun stuff.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:31.460]   People want to, on Facebook, people don't want to have big, important things.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.420]   They want fun and sort of relax a little bit.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.900]   Actually, when we talked about this, it must have been you on this week in Google.
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.140]   I can't remember what it was.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.140]   We were talking about upworthy and you said that they want to see less of this and not
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140]   more of this.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:52.340]   Right, and it's like, I think that it's similar to sort of Bezos buying the Washington Post.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.460]   These are technology companies that are just doing these things and they want to be more
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.460]   important.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.460]   They want to be a social force for good.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.460]   Google's doing the same thing.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:03.220]   Actually, they have these long-form, so-called long-form journalist places.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.380]   They're trying to bolster the things.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:09.860]   I think to a certain extent, Phil guilty about the trivialization of culture.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.860]   And it's getting so advanced.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.500]   They don't feel guilty about any kind.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.660]   They are the creators of the trivialization of culture.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.660]   If you guilty that they did that?
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:23.740]   Well, I think that they have pretensions of being a force for good.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.700]   And so if you look at all the things Zuckerberg has been doing, he's got the lobbying, the
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.940]   trial and all that kind of stuff.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:35.180]   So Mark Zuckerberg is a guy who only kills his own, he only stuff he kills and all this
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.180]   kind of stuff.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.180]   He's still throwing that bad away.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.180]   He had a guy the other day.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.180]   He shot the guy.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.180]   He did kill him.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.940]   Okay, is this a close your eyes, John?
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.220]   This is, I'm going to give you a up worthy headline and then a headline generated by
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.220]   the up worthy generator.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.740]   And you have to tell me which is which.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:04:00.140]   The way this poet talks about manhood has me questioning exactly what it is or that
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.780]   moment when an actor won't retreat.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.780]   Wow, they both suck.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:05.780]   How about this one?
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:09.940]   I thought it was a menace to equality, but then I saw this troubling vlog.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.700]   That's got to be machine.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.180]   It's machine created.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.000]   And what's funny is that the up worthy generator, which is up worthy generator.com always has
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.940]   a tearful woman is the video.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.020]   It's the video thumbnail.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:27.940]   Watch a forgotten LGBT activist become an inspiration with one question.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.100]   Who wouldn't Facebook this?
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.100]   Right?
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:37.780]   Although I have to say these are also these are equally, you know, Facebook worthy.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.300]   That's what really gets me.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.180]   And of course, a big share on Facebook button at top and bottom.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.240]   I see I used to see a lot of these in my feet, but ever since we talked about this, I do
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.420]   find that you're right.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.780]   Facebook seems to be filtering these out now.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.260]   Facebook tries to get into the real news business.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.180]   You won't believe what happened next.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.340]   I don't I don't want it.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.940]   And I also don't want the suggested post.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:02.940]   Every second post.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.940]   That is so I don't go here anymore.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.900]   You know, there's a suggested post is an ad.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.820]   We're close.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.300]   You went right back to that page again.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.700]   You couldn't keep a conversation going.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   Why is this on Facebook?
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.700]   You had to go back.
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.100]   My God, look how many of these bobbleheads people are buying.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.900]   Did we buy an ad?
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.900]   Limited time offer.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.860]   No, that's one of those phony deals where you that's this is the stupidest thing.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.700]   This is the repeat as that everyone's buying into.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.700]   Because you've looked at this page.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.700]   It shows up everywhere now.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.700]   Oh, really?
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.700]   That's not a real ad.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.860]   No, it's a it's your this shows that you're interested in.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:42.300]   And so we're going to hound you on every page you go to with pictures of this thing that
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.300]   you're looking at.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300]   But you're selling it.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.300]   They don't even know.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.300]   Never do what I did.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.740]   I bought some on I was looking for some underwear on online.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.220]   That was a mistake based on this.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.660]   And for a month I had nothing but like dudes wearing underwear.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.660]   Like all of a sudden.
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.460]   You're not doing what I did.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.380]   You know, I do the same thing only I bought to pens and it's amazing.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:10.580]   Instagram, Instagram off Facebook property and a Facebook bought them because they were
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:15.980]   so scared that everybody was going to Instagram and immediately they started turning into something
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.980]   horrible.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:21.580]   They added first they added video non by the way, autoplay video both Facebook and Instagram
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.540]   do the one thing that everybody agrees you should not do on the web, which is autoplay
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.540]   video.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.540]   They should shoot people who do that.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.540]   Yes.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.980]   And they do it because they want you to get used to it so they can start running ads.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.980]   Would you get that shirt?
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:36.260]   Yes, I know she I know she admiring my shirt.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.260]   How you like that?
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.260]   Fantastic.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:42.900]   So it's a rocket rain and then it goes around the back and then the reindeer.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.620]   And there's a hula girl on an island.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.420]   Yeah, well it's a Hawaiian shirt.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.060]   You can't have a Hawaiian shirt without a hula girl.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.540]   It's important.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.700]   So now Instagram.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:57.260]   So they added that now Instagram has added the Instagram direct and already I saw somebody
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:03.060]   in my feed who didn't realize that when he posted a picture hitting on a girl and then
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.460]   did it to another girl another girl every single person he sent that picture to could
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.100]   see who else he sent the picture to.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.420]   Yeah, I posted that.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.180]   That's where he's on.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.380]   So it's a line along the bottom of all the girls he mapped on.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.380]   And then the final one says, dude, you know, we can all see this.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.620]   The Instagram is not used to this whole process.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.100]   Damn it.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.460]   How long before a husband gets caught doing this, right?
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.980]   No, it's probably already happened.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.140]   Probably already happened.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   Apparently according to Instagram, half of all the people who use Instagram use it every
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.140]   single day.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.500]   That's 75 and a half million.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.140]   That's a lot of people.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:45.540]   But I think this whole Instagram direct thing is a reaction to a certain extent to Twitter
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.820]   essentially getting into the Instagram business.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:52.180]   Now the pictures are just showing up in the feed and right and Twitter is really pushing
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.980]   the sharing pictures above all.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.340]   Do you realize I can see how many other girls you've sent this picture?
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.860]   By the way, show the picture because it's a sensitive guy.
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:01.860]   Yeah, right.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:02.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:03.860]   Can you get the whole picture?
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:04.860]   I guess you can't.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:05.860]   Mike, that was from your feeds.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.380]   But it's, but it, and I think that it's, it's actually, they're saying that it's a Snapchat
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:14.100]   clone, which is I think a terrible, it's simply not true.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:18.100]   And not the first attempt because they rewrote poke to be a Snapchat clone.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.100]   Exactly.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   It does not self-destruct.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.740]   The messages don't self-destruct.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.740]   And that's the whole point of Snapchat is not.
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.740]   Understand it.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.740]   Femoral or whatever.
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.300]   I think it is a lot like Google plus Pinterest and path.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:34.020]   It's like path in the sense that you can only send it to 15 people, path, path you can
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.020]   send to 150 people.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.660]   But the point is that it's absolutely limited in the number of people who are going to see
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:39.900]   this thing.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   And it's, it's private.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.420]   So your wife and all your girlfriends.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.300]   And so, and the risk is that it's going to make Instagram, so it's just more and more
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.220]   crap on top of it.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.220]   And I think that the reason that Twitter succeeded, Instagram succeeded, it was simple.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.740]   It did one thing and did it well.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.740]   Right.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.100]   They both started as just, you post something and it's public.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.220]   And anybody who wants to see it can follow you.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.740]   And anybody who gets it can share it.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.100]   And that was a simple model that everybody understood.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.100]   Everybody understood.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.140]   Now I think that there's, you know, a desire, you know, what's happening is that the kids,
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.420]   teenagers and young people, they don't want to be famous.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.900]   They don't want to be public.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.540]   They want private little circles.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:21.580]   And so everybody's worried about the future of social networks and they see these people
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   going off.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:27.060]   That's one of the reasons that, that, you know, a lot of you have all these like tiny
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:30.500]   little social networks popping up in Tumblr too.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.900]   This is where the young people are going so that their parents won't find them essentially.
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900]   Have that.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.060]   And this is what Facebook learned it when faith, because that's how Facebook started
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.060]   right.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.060]   It was private.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.060]   It's hard to monetize.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.140]   Ultimately, Facebook wants to go get your stuff public.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   Right.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.140]   That's right.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   And then you're going to do all these other sites.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.140]   Exactly.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.140]   How do you monetize Snapchat?
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.140]   Exactly.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.260]   It's very difficult to do.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.060]   The whole public model is a great model because you get, you know, you get people building
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.420]   huge audiences.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   Right.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:02.340]   But so, so what, so you're saying that this is a response to Twitter?
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.540]   I think it is because Twitter got it.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.380]   It's the Chicago way, Leo.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:12.020]   You know, Twitter started getting, you know, acting like Instagram and Instagram is now,
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.220]   you know, part of Facebook, of course.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.180]   So this is a Facebook versus Twitter.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.180]   That's what it's really about.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.260]   It's the future of social networking.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.780]   And they're all going after the teens and the 20-somethings who really just, you know,
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.060]   they really need to send to tiny little groups privately.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.420]   But we're on the topic.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.220]   Let's talk about the blocking thing that you wanted to bring.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.780]   Yeah, that Twitter changed the rules of blocking.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:35.980]   My approach to Twitter is I block people left and right.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:36.980]   Me too.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:39.820]   I don't go on Twitter to get into arguments, debates or whatever.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   Or listen to bull crap.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.020]   I go there for a number of specific purposes.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.540]   And if somebody wants, you know, if they look at me cross-eyed, they're blocked.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.540]   I don't care.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.940]   Because now in the past, they couldn't read your stuff.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.300]   You couldn't, you wouldn't see their stuff, but they couldn't see your stuff.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.300]   Right.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   Unless they logged out.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.300]   Well, you can log in.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.940]   I think you could always log into somebody's specific account as an anonymous slash your
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   name.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   Exactly.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.940]   But that's good.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.940]   You have to go out of your way to do that.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.660]   The problem is that Twitter, the conversations are kind of distributed on Twitter.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.260]   It's a structural issue.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:16.220]   So if I post something and somebody sees it and they want to give me a hard time, they
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.220]   can do that.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.660]   And the blocking feature just has me with my head in the sand and my fingers and my
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.660]   eyes.
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.660]   In other words, they're talking about you, but you don't know.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.660]   Exactly.
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.940]   If you look at the care, if you look at the care either, if you look at something like
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:32.380]   Google+, where if I block somebody on Google+, they can't comment on the conversations on
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.620]   Google+, or happening on my stream.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.860]   They're not happening out there.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.380]   But that's the difference in Google+, and Twitter.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.380]   That's right.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.380]   You're on your stream on Twitter.
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.380]   There is no, you don't have a stream per se.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.900]   So for people who are super sensitive about being harassed or being publicly humiliated
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.740]   or being abused or whatever, Twitter is probably not a good choice.
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.420]   You're in public.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.740]   Yeah, you're in public.
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:59.980]   And you can either close it to everybody except for those to whom you give explicit permission.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.620]   That does exist, and that does work to certain things.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.060]   And isn't that what Twitter is trying to eliminate?
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.700]   This is that same thing, making everybody be public because it's easier to monetize.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.620]   They don't want people to have private Twitter accounts, right?
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.900]   I would imagine a lot of them.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.140]   That would be the way to get a rid of harassers, so just go private.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.460]   I'm a huge fan of blocking.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:22.540]   Blocking is the greatest thing ever because people can hijack conversations.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.900]   And it's really, people feel weird about blocking people, right?
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.340]   Because you think, "Well, I shouldn't do that.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.340]   It's really not nice.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   It has to be an extreme case."
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.900]   I do it because it's not nice.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.820]   But allowing somebody off, I bet for you too.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:39.260]   But allowing somebody to wreck conversations is not nice to the other people in the conversation.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.260]   Right.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.420]   So you really have to, it's like the old Star Trek thing.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.740]   You really want to benefit the larger group rather than the individual person.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.620]   So they did the right thing?
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.700]   I think they did do the right thing.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:55.940]   They basically went from the new policy which they now canceled, simply made it super convenient
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:02.260]   for people to harass other people through the balance of power over to the harassers.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:06.460]   And now they're back to the original policy which makes it somewhat inconvenient to harass
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.460]   somebody.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.780]   It's not a perfect system but it's better than the one that they temporarily had.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.860]   I think that really has to do with the fact that people don't understand to this day that
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.380]   Twitter is a public place.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.100]   And the only way for it not to be is for you to have a private account.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.900]   I think it's peculiar that someone would not get that.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.740]   I don't think people really understand.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.180]   I tell people all the time I talk to people who don't understand how to use the app.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.180]   They're following you.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.660]   You're some famous person, let's say a football player.
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.660]   Or a coach.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.660]   And you got like...
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.660]   Well they understand it's public.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:41.700]   They say some weird stuff for people who think it's public.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.060]   Or know it's public, I'm sorry.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.620]   Well what happens is somebody will start a Twitter account and they have 20 people following
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.020]   them and they'll post things and they have the same conversations with the same tiny
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.020]   group of people.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.260]   And then all of a sudden somebody re-tweets it and then somebody else re-tweets it.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.660]   Next thing you know they have a million things and they're on CNN or whatever and it's like
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:59.660]   they're relays.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.660]   It's very public.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.660]   Yeah, it's very public.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.980]   So it's potentially public.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.980]   Most people have privacy through anonymity until they don't.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.860]   Pizza Box in our chat room says, "Well you got to understand advertisers are really indistinguishable
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.940]   from harassers and we're going to make it easier for advertisers."
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:17.700]   I guess there's some collateral too.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.700]   That's true actually.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.700]   That's a good observation.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.700]   Absolutely.
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.700]   Nice one Pizza Box.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.340]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.980]   If you're at the post office this week you know it's going to be a zoo.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:33.300]   Everybody who normally doesn't go to the post office mailing packages, buying stamps.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.020]   And if you do mailing for a living it's very important that you have a way to get the job
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.300]   done without getting over to the post office and fighting for parking and fighting for
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.460]   a place in the line.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.060]   That's why I want you to get a Stamps.com account especially right now.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:52.140]   If you sell on Amazon or eBay or Etsy or PayPal if you do mailers, if you send invoices out,
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.740]   it's the easiest way to do it.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:58.300]   Stamps.com lets you buy and print official US postage without leaving your desk from your
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.860]   computer with your printer.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:00.860]   You can print the postage.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.860]   You can print stamps.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.100]   You know sticky labels.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.980]   I actually come in here and get stamps printed whenever I need stamps.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.980]   But you can also print right under the envelope.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:15.100]   If you got QuickBooks or you got an address book at work it'll take all the addresses
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.260]   to kind of like mail merge right out of the address book.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.100]   You're taking the company's research.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.100]   You're using company stamps.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.100]   Somebody I can do that.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.260]   That's the beauty of this.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.020]   I already bought them.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.020]   That's okay.
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.020]   Right?
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.020]   Why would that be illegal?
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.020]   You steal pens.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.020]   I didn't say it was illegal.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.420]   You can't steal pens from yourself.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.420]   Can you?
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.420]   I don't know.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.220]   Let me ask Lisa.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.700]   Can I steal pens from the company?
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.700]   No.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.700]   She says no.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.700]   You can't steal pens from the company.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.700]   She's the bookkeeper.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.660]   I'm stealing them for Lisa.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660]   That's who I'm stealing from.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.660]   All right.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.660]   All right.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.660]   I won't take stamps anymore.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.660]   I'll get my own stamps.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.660]   I was wondering.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.660]   It's a good point.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.660]   No.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.660]   You're keeping me honest.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.660]   You've always done that.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.660]   It's like 1990.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.660]   1988.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.860]   Is that when we first met?
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.860]   Well, something like that.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.860]   It probably is actually.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.820]   And you can't use the scale for cooking.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.820]   You have to leave it at once.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:02.820]   Wow.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.820]   That's going too far.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.820]   You get the great USB scale.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.340]   You plop your letter, your postage right on there, your box.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.700]   It'll print right on the envelope.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.500]   It'll print a mailing label.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.300]   Put your corporate logo on there.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.900]   And then the mail carrier comes and takes it.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.860]   Doesn't matter what size it is, they will pick it up.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.820]   There's even a button on stamp.com that says, "Hey mailman, come to me."
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.220]   This is so much better than a postage.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.980]   I mean, first of all, it's a lot more affordable.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:28.140]   You also get discounts that you won't get at the post office on priority mail, priority
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.140]   express mail.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.140]   All right.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.060]   Go to stamps.com.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.060]   Stop messing around.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.700]   Just go there and click that microphone on the upper right hand corner, Chad, and type
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.700]   in "Twit."
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.700]   That's the offer code.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.220]   And you're going to get $110.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.380]   No risk trial at stamps.com.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.900]   Of course, you get a month of stamps.com free.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.140]   But you also get the scale.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.140]   You just pay shipping and hand it to the bottom.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.140]   Now is the time to do this.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.140]   Oh, yes.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.140]   USB 4 Christmas.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   I mean, this is the last time you want to go to the post office.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.220]   You also get $55 in postage coupons you can use over the next few months.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.380]   It really is a good deal.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:01.380]   It's a nice time to go to stamps.com.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.380]   Many of our listeners have started to use stamps.com.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   And they all report back that they are very happy not going to the post office anymore.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.380]   Unless you got a crush on that cute postal worker, that's different.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.380]   Where's this?
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   The cuba...
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   You told me, and I did not know this, that every post office is like a franchise.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.380]   Pretty much.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.380]   It can be good ones and bad ones.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.380]   The postmaster determines whether it's going to be good or bad or how they manage it.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:28.380]   Some of them are horrible, they don't like to do anything or there's long lines.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:29.780]   You can take down the stamps lower third.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.380]   This is not part of the commercial.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.380]   And some of them are gone the ball.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.380]   It's like, holy mackerel, this is a great post office.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380]   That's so interesting.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.380]   Do you think it would be like a national standard?
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.380]   No, you're absolutely right.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.380]   No, it's not.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:44.380]   It's not the way they're organized in a funny kind of distributed network way.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.380]   I always...
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.380]   This guy knows more about the postal service.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.380]   Actually, you know more about other things.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.380]   That's because the post office is being ripped off by the government that's making them pay
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.380]   75 years in advance to screw them.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.380]   I mean, they're actually making money.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.380]   They're trying to screw the unions.
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:02.380]   I mean, the whole post office is terrible.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.380]   The post office is going out of business is nonsense.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.380]   The post office is great.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:11.380]   They want to kill the post office so everybody has to go through federal express and UPS pay
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.380]   twice as much, ten times as much.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:17.380]   And then also, by the way, the law is about postal fraud and all the rest of it are out
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:18.380]   the window.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.380]   Oh.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.380]   And now they can open your mail and do cares.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.380]   That's a good point.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.380]   That's a very good point.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.380]   It's a pretty secure system.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.380]   They do take pictures of the outside, but that's okay.
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.380]   Yeah, but so what?
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.380]   So what?
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:35.900]   The thing about the post office that's great is that they're one of the few aspects in
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.380]   our society where they are obligated to serve everybody.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.380]   Right.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.380]   And this is...
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   Very dead, right.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.700]   And we already talked about Amazon, and so I don't mean to bring that back up again, but
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:51.060]   I think that Amazon's long-term strategy is to cut FedEx and UPS out of the business,
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:57.660]   do all the sweet spot deliveries themselves for the really high volume deliveries, and
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.180]   then let the post office do all the people out in the...
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.100]   Didn't they make a deal with the post office for Sunday delivery?
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.100]   For Sunday delivery.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.100]   How did they...
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.100]   Do we get a delivery the other day on Sunday?
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.100]   Incredible.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.100]   And it was a postal worker.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.100]   Is that wild?
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.100]   And that's Amazon.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.100]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.100]   That's already happened.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.100]   Yeah, we got a Sunday the other day.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.100]   But does...
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.100]   Okay, I'm confused.
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.100]   It's crazy.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.700]   Because even the mail, the postal service doesn't do Sunday delivery.
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.700]   No, they never have.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.180]   So they have XS capacities lying around and so...
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.660]   I don't know how they're doing it.
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.380]   Whatever the case is, all I know is the Saturday thing wasn't killed like everyone wanted
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.380]   to do because of the rural guys moaning and groaning in front of Congress.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.380]   Rightly so.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.380]   Yes.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:33.380]   And we're going to kill our little institution.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.980]   And so now the Sunday thing is like, it's like going in the opposite...
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.340]   And they'll make more money.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.100]   Let's hope so.
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.500]   I hope so too.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.340]   Now if you want mail, don't use Amazon.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.900]   I mean Yahoo.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.740]   Because apparently now the Yahoo mail outage, which everybody was...
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:48.740]   Boy, it was over.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.060]   Fure over that this week.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.060]   It's only 1%.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.180]   Yeah, that's what they say.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.820]   Yeah, that's what they say.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.820]   We don't know.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.260]   We will never know.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:01.340]   Rissa Meyer said it was...
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.980]   This has become the stock excuse anytime a service goes down.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.460]   Misconfigured server.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.460]   Yep.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:12.300]   They sent to all their users complete details of everything.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.220]   Of course nobody got those emails.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:15.780]   So it's still a mystery.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.820]   No, actually though, if you didn't get mail, it is queued up.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.260]   You're not going to lose mail, right?
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.260]   That's right.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.260]   You'll just get it late.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:23.620]   I hope so.
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:28.980]   For many of us, Red Marissa Meyer's apology, she uses a tumbler for her blog.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.740]   Even before they bought tumblers, she used it.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:32.740]   Yahoo mail is...
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:33.740]   Who likes tumbler?
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:34.740]   Yeah, she likes it.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:37.020]   Is a lifeline to our friends, family members and customers.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:40.100]   This week we experienced a major outage that not only interrupted that connection because
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:41.900]   many of you have massive inconvenience.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.220]   I saw articles on all the tech blogs, how to move your mail off Yahoo mail, how to start
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.780]   using Google mail instead of Yahoo mail.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:52.740]   A lot of people were upset, but I guess if you have hundreds of millions of users, 1%
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.740]   is not...
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.740]   That's a lot of people.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:57.660]   You're going to hear about it.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:01.260]   Marissa Meyer noted that a confusing scheduled maintenance error...
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:06.580]   Which had some users...
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.740]   The error message, oh I see, was confusing.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:13.500]   It said we're having a schedule maintenance, which was wrong.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.420]   More lies.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:21.340]   But where really, and I've heard from a lot of people, as hit people, is small businesses
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.220]   that use Yahoo business.
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.500]   A lot of them are very upset.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.940]   This is a big time for them and a lot of them lost business.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.300]   A lot of Yahoo business sites were down.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.540]   It really was a bigger mess I think than they're copying to.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:40.700]   On Wednesday, we interviewed the executive director of the Webbies.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.180]   She's playing?
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.900]   No, Tiffany's not there anymore.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   What'd she do?
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.100]   She's doing a documentary or something like that.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.060]   She's gone Hollywood.
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:53.860]   But what I was fun, because I went back to the year...
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.580]   Was it the year 2000 Webby Awards?
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.580]   Year 2000.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.380]   In the year 2000.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:04.700]   Actually, it was 1999.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.380]   I think it was '99.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.740]   And the Webbies were...
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.780]   It was for technical achievement.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.100]   In '99, what was it?
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100]   It was...
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.020]   Was it '99?
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   Whatever.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.020]   Get to the point.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:22.260]   I want to show this video, because it was...
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.260]   Google won it.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:27.780]   Remember, in the early part of days of Google, you were at Tech TV asking people, "What's
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.460]   the search engine you use?"
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.460]   I was.
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:31.740]   Because people were still using Yahoo.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.740]   You knew.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.740]   They were bozos.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.100]   Well, it was kind of just...
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.340]   I never said that.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.460]   But that was implied.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.460]   It was implied.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.460]   Or if they said Alta Vista.
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:47.180]   Well, no, Alta Vista at least is acceptable to Yahoo back then when Google was killing
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.180]   him.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.180]   Yeah, it was like it's a bad idea.
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.860]   Well, at the time.
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.820]   Well I want you to tell me, because...
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.180]   Shlane used to be on our show, Elita.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.180]   I love Tiffany Shlane.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.380]   She's a character.
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.060]   She was great.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:01.260]   Her dad wrote amazing books.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.260]   Yeah?
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.820]   Do you know her dad?
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:05.820]   No, I never.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.820]   No.
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:07.820]   No.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.820]   He was a Marin doctor.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.700]   He wrote some really interesting stuff.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:11.700]   Look him up.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.620]   I want to find this video.
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.460]   We had the guy on and I played it.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:16.460]   I just don't know.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:19.540]   Somebody typed in, it looks like they asked G's.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:21.100]   Some of this stuff is...
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.100]   Ask G's.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.100]   There you go.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.100]   Ask G's?
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.100]   No, I think it was G's.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.100]   I think it would be a great product.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.100]   But that's now Ask.com.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.100]   It's still here, right?
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.100]   I can sign the video of them taking it.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.100]   Larry Page and...
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.100]   Well this show is going to come to a grinding...
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.100]   It is right now.
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.100]   It's halting.
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.940]   Go back and check on your sales, because you only have a few minutes left, ladies and
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.340]   gentlemen, to get your buy-in for this bobblehead doll.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.340]   Very special.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.140]   Would you do a little ad for the bobblehead while I...
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.140]   It's a very special bobblehead doll.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.140]   Well I find this...
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:51.140]   It actually does look like Leo if you shake it hard enough.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:52.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.420]   And then you're the editor, Jay Leno, one of the two.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.900]   I wanted to find the video.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:01.460]   Because Larry Page and Sergey Brinkell on stage in Roar's Gates, and there's a young
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.380]   woman behind them.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.860]   And I'm pretty sure it's Marissa Meyer, and I just want you to look at it.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.860]   Tell me who it is.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.860]   No, that's a scandal if true.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.860]   Why?
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:09.860]   I guess it wouldn't be.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.860]   Well no, she was like number six or something.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.860]   It could be always...
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860]   It could be.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:14.860]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.860]   But she's a very different Marissa Meyer.
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:17.020]   Did you look so geeky?
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.020]   It's really good.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.020]   Did you see the picture of her in high school?
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020]   2000.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.020]   It came out recently?
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.020]   No.
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.700]   She's actually literally wearing a beanie with a propeller.
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:25.700]   Yes.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.700]   Yes.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:27.700]   Yes.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.620]   She's a highly geeky, which I love.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.620]   Good for her.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620]   It's okay.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.620]   I think it was dressed.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.620]   I think it was career day.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:38.020]   She was wearing a tie, business tie, and a propeller head.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.020]   Shoot.
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.540]   All right, here we go.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.300]   I guess we're never going to see this, so we might as well go on to the next topic.
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.900]   I'm going to find it.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:46.900]   Damn it.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:47.900]   Geez.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:48.900]   How many Google...
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:49.900]   How many Google heads have we sold?
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:50.900]   Yeah, we go.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.900]   Let's get there.
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:53.860]   Let's get that back to the points.
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.420]   The real point is how many Google heads have we sold?
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.820]   Oh, we're so close.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:58.820]   And it's not plastered.
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:24:59.820]   Two or fourteen sold.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.740]   No, no, this is highly carbonate.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.740]   Okay.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:03.740]   It's a fine polycarbonate.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:04.740]   37 left, actually 36.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:05.740]   All right.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.940]   They're going on with their going.
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.340]   36, that's 36.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.060]   Oh, sorry.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.060]   People came here.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.060]   They came here to watch us show.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.260]   And we're got 36.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:15.260]   Only a few minutes left.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.460]   We're going to have to move to the next item.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.620]   Cara Swisher says, "Do you agree?"
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:26.260]   She's by the way, the person has been breaking the news about Yahoo.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:31.180]   Yahoo Mail is a consumer disaster, but the company's response is even worse, she says.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.180]   Kick the cans.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:34.900]   I guess there's a falling out between those two.
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.620]   I don't think she ever loved Yahoo.
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:40.100]   She just was the inside person.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.820]   I don't think it's the disaster.
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:42.820]   She says it is.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:43.820]   I know things.
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:44.820]   It's a short-term disaster.
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.580]   And the response was awful.
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.260]   And the whole thing was a big clumsy mess.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.300]   And not good because Marissa Meyer is a untet...
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.260]   People are still on the fence about whether she's...
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.260]   Right.
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:58.340]   Something that ever happened to Yahoo or she's or not.
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.300]   But I think a year from now, nobody will out.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:04.180]   Yeah, nobody will carry you from now, as long as they don't have additional problems,
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.540]   as long as it doesn't become a trend.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:12.420]   So according to Business Insider, you know what I want, says Marissa Meyer, to buy Imager.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:17.820]   This is the image storage site that's used heavily on Reddit.
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:20.740]   And I'm not sure what...
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.140]   Why Yahoo would want Imager.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.460]   I didn't realize Imager was started in 2009.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.460]   It's pretty new.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:26.460]   You're kidding.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:28.460]   I didn't know that.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.460]   I feel like it's been around forever.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:34.700]   It was started by Alan Schaff, who was a student at the time at University of Ohio at Athens.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.900]   He made the site as a gift to Reddit because he was annoyed at how hard to use the web
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.580]   photo sharing sites were.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.580]   So what do you think?
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:46.260]   A billion-dollar payday for the kid?
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.260]   I think it should be.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.580]   I mean, you know, you can't...
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   Why would...
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.580]   They've got Flickr.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.580]   Yeah, but...
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   They wrecked Flickr.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.060]   They might as well wreck Imager.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:57.180]   I think they just want to get in on that.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.180]   They want to...
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.180]   They want the customs.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.180]   They want the writers.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:02.100]   Yeah, it's so closely associated with Reddit.
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.540]   You can't use Reddit without using this.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.540]   And so...
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.860]   You can't post all that porn on Reddit without using these products.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.180]   You need Imager.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.580]   There's so much porn on Reddit that Yahoo should be ashamed of itself.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:15.580]   Well, not as much Tumblr.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.980]   Oh, I'm sorry you're right.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.940]   But actually, Reddit's full of porn too.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:19.940]   Yes.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:20.940]   I find both sites are pretty...
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.940]   They just stick with Tumblr for porn.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:23.940]   Oh, okay.
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.660]   So there's porn on Reddit too?
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:26.660]   Yes.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:27.660]   Good.
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:28.660]   Good to know.
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.660]   So they...
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.660]   I wouldn't know, Leo.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:31.660]   I wouldn't either.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:32.660]   But John...
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:33.660]   Yeah, you do.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.660]   But John, how do you find the porn?
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:35.660]   Correct.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.260]   Didn't they disable the porn from the search engines or something like that?
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:38.900]   No, you can type in anything you get pulled.
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:39.900]   Oh, really.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.100]   I thought they stopped allowing you to search for it.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.100]   Let's try.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.100]   No, maybe...
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.580]   AT&T CEO Randall Stevenson...
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.900]   Remember, he's the guy who said the biggest mistake I ever made was "unlucky."
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.700]   Unlimited data on the iPhone.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:57.860]   Now he says, "You know, we're not going to be able to subsidize these phones anymore."
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.700]   I think this is the biggest...
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.700]   I'm sorry, it's...
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.700]   Get ready.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.700]   First of all, they make the money back because they lock you in for two years in the subsidizing
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.700]   phone.
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.580]   They make so much more money on subsidize phones.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:12.060]   People have no idea how much they're paying for that new iPhone, a new Android phone.
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.460]   They think it's 99 bucks.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.460]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:16.460]   Exactly.
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:17.460]   And the remainder of that, they're not...
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.020]   It's a monthly fee, baby.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.740]   Folks, when you subsidize something...
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:25.980]   That means you take money from someplace over here and you give it to people over there.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   That's what a subsidy is.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:28.980]   What AT&T does...
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.500]   It sounds like communism.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:35.980]   They take money from you and then they give you back less of what they took from you.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:37.460]   That's what they're calling a subsidy.
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:41.100]   It's not a subsidy and this whole thing that they can barely afford it feels to me like
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.300]   a publicity stunt to make people feel like it's a good deal.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.780]   It sounds like they're really intending to do the opposite.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.780]   By the way...
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.780]   Yes.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.380]   I think that HTC won such a great phone after all.
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:53.940]   Oh, I gave you my one and you don't like it.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.940]   It's battery.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.940]   It's terrible.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.940]   It just wants to drop dead.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.780]   Like, you know, it's got a fully charged, you pull off the USB thing and you go...
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:01.780]   And it's dead.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:03.460]   It's not a phone I would buy.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.780]   And you didn't even put a card in it.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:05.780]   You're not even using it as a phone.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.100]   No, I'm using it as a Wi-Fi.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.660]   Imagine putting in a card.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.100]   Oh, yeah, it'd be done.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.780]   No, you have to really tweak it around to get decent battery life on that thing.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:14.780]   Well...
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:15.780]   You got to run some...
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.780]   Just some other issues with it too.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:17.780]   You know, the plain vanilla...
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.780]   You liked your Nexus 5.
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:20.780]   Actually, that's...
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:21.780]   This is the old one.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.780]   This is the Galaxy.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.780]   That's Galaxy Nexus.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:24.780]   Works fine.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:26.780]   It's like a year old, Jim.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:27.780]   Eric's...
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:28.780]   Yeah, unbelievable.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.780]   Eric, my son has the new one.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:32.780]   I love the Nexus 5.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.780]   And it's...
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:35.780]   It's not great battery life either.
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:37.780]   They did just upgrade the camera though.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.780]   Yes.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.780]   That's a lot.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.780]   I think the Nexus 5 is a nice phone.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780]   All right.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:42.780]   Anyway.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:43.780]   So you don't like the one?
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:44.780]   No.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.780]   Okay.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.780]   Let's put it this way.
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:47.780]   It's really disappointing.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:48.780]   Because I expect that to be the best.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:50.780]   What else you got?
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.780]   I'll give you a different one.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:53.780]   Okay.
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.780]   Just the only way to do honest reviews.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:56.780]   Yeah, you got...
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.780]   This is it.
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.780]   You got to get it from me.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:00.780]   This is the reasoning that CEO of AT&T gave.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:04.780]   He says, "Smart phone penetration is at 75 percent.
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:08.780]   Soon we'll be almost all the way in, reaching 90 percent penetration."
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:14.780]   That means we don't have to be as aggressive in a device subsidies.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:18.780]   When you're growing the business, you're aggressive because you're trying to get people on the
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.780]   network, but as you approach 90 percent penetration, there's a dirty joke in here somewhere.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:24.780]   You move into maintenance mode.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.780]   I could think of 5.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:26.780]   That means...
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.780]   That means more device upgrades and the model has to change.
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.780]   You can't afford to subsidize devices like that anymore.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:38.780]   I can't imagine people spending 600 bucks on a phone.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.780]   No, I think it's a thing to know.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.780]   As soon as he turns off the subsidies, nobody's going to buy a phone.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.780]   I think the devices are coming down.
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:44.780]   The prices are coming down.
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.780]   So drastically, they don't need to do this anymore.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.780]   I think you'd be good phone, 200 bucks, max.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:54.780]   The Moto X you can get now on Republic Wireless, off contract, 179 bucks.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:55.780]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:56.780]   That's the price.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:57.780]   Is that the G or the...
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.780]   That's the X.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:30:59.780]   The G is even cheaper.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:00.780]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.780]   All right.
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.780]   So you don't think this is greed on his part?
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:12.780]   I think they're casting about for a model that's going to take them into a future where lots of people are buying off contract phones.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:18.780]   And the whole subsidy thing is a way to hide the actual costs.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:19.780]   Right.
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:20.780]   Who knows what the value is?
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.780]   But it works.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.780]   It has worked.
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:23.780]   It has worked.
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:24.780]   It has worked.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.780]   It has worked.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.780]   It absolutely has.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:30.780]   And so somebody did the breakdown and it's pretty stunning if you think about it.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:37.780]   So let's say you get an iPhone and you get it subsidized and let's say they subsidize 400 bucks on that iPhone.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:43.780]   So divide the 24 months of your contract by the $400 and that's where you're paying each month.
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:47.780]   So as soon as you've paid it off, right, and you don't get a new...
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.780]   If you don't get a new phone, you're still paying that money for that iPhone month after month after month.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.780]   For years.
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:54.780]   Right.
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:55.780]   They don't...
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:59.780]   As soon as it's paid off to your contract, they don't reduce the price by the amount that they were charging.
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.780]   Right.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.780]   That's the profit.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:03.780]   It's a golden goose for them.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:08.780]   I just don't believe that it's like a big financial burden for AT&T to subsidize.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:09.780]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:10.780]   This bull crap.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.780]   It might be though what he's saying is, but you know what, people don't keep it after the minute the two years is up, they buy another phone.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:17.780]   They buy another phone.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:18.780]   Well, they incentivize that.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.780]   I mean, they say, "Okay, you have an upgrade now."
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:22.780]   They want to keep you at...
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.780]   Right.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.780]   So here's another thing AT&T is doing.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:25.780]   Would you pay...
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.780]   Okay, here's a question for both of you guys.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:30.780]   If you could get Gigabit Internet service, Gigabit...
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:31.780]   I can go for that.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:33.780]   It's $70 a month, but...
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:34.780]   Yep.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:35.780]   But here's the catch.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:38.780]   You have to participate in AT&T Internet preferences.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:48.780]   That means AT&T may use your web browsing information, like the search terms you enter and the web pages you visit, to provide you with relevant offers and ads tailored to your interests.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.780]   Where would these ads show up?
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:51.780]   Mmm.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.780]   Would they just show up?
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:53.780]   I think so.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.780]   I think so.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.780]   This Nebu...
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.780]   Well, maybe it's not Nebu Ad...
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   Remember Form and Nebu Ad which were very controversial and finally had to stop doing it.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.780]   Right.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.780]   Okay, so this is from Gig Aome.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:03.780]   Stacey Higginbottom writing.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.780]   Stacey says, "We use various methods..."
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:06.780]   This is...
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:07.780]   He or she asked AT&T.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.780]   How does this work?
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:10.780]   AT&T is a response.
[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:23.780]   "We use various methods to collect web browsing information, currently reviewing the methods we may use for Internet preferences program.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:29.780]   Whichever method is used will not collect information from secure or otherwise encrypted sites, like banking.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:30.780]   Thank you."
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.780]   Very nice of you AT&T or when a credit card is used.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:38.780]   And we won't sell your personal information to anyone for any reason.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.780]   AT&T does not plan to overlay ads on top of a site's existing ads.
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.780]   It will instead use its targeting abilities to deliver better ads.
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:48.780]   In other words, they provide that information to add.
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.780]   That's a good thing.
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.780]   So, back to your question.
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:58.780]   If all that was true, if they kept their word, I would be entirely different.
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:00.780]   Do you have so many bucks?
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:02.780]   The headline says "Spy on your searches."
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.780]   But in fact, what they're doing is they're just giving you more relevant advertising.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.780]   You're doing what Google's doing already with my gene?
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:08.780]   Exactly.
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:10.780]   It's not relevant at all, but go on.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.780]   Well, but that's a fail.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:16.780]   I mean, Facebook, if you look at Facebook's relevant advertising, it's completely irrelevant oftentimes.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:17.780]   Even Google's is not that good.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:18.780]   That's right.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:21.780]   They struggle with the quality of this relevance.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:26.780]   In fact, I think there's a jury still out on whether targeted ads work better than untargeted ads.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.780]   That's another good question.
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:32.780]   But if you could trust that that's what they were going to do with the data, then yeah, I'd definitely do it.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.780]   The problem is the reason all this stuff is creepy, and I've been thinking a lot about this later.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.780]   You may be asked this question sooner than later.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:39.780]   Absolutely.
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.780]   And the reason it's creepy is I don't think people really trust that they're going to do exactly what they say.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.780]   I think AT&T is already selling your location information to the government.
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.780]   To the government.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:50.780]   To the government.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.780]   To the feds.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.780]   Do they probably give it to them for free?
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:53.780]   No, no, they make money up.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.780]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:56.780]   They have a special government portal where they're going to be able to get it.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:01.780]   They also have a menu of prices where you could get this.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.780]   Buck 50 will tell you where that guy was any day of the year.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:05.780]   That's right.
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   But if we could, you know, that's, and that's the problem with all this kind of stuff.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:09.780]   You don't know where this information is going.
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:12.780]   You don't know if the NSA is looking at this information.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:13.780]   They're looking at it anyway.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:14.780]   So it's.
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:15.780]   Okay, here's.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.780]   I do.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:17.780]   Okay.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.780]   So you would not take this question.
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:19.780]   I would take, here's what I would do.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:25.780]   I would take the deal, but I find some hacker buddy of mine and we Jerry rigged the thing so they get phoned.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:29.780]   So they get phony search stuff and I wouldn't get ads at all.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.780]   They'd be shunted off to some where's like, oh yeah, he saw that ad.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:33.780]   Sure he did.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:34.780]   And if phony clicks.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.780]   So you'd steal from them.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:38.780]   It wouldn't be stealing.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.780]   Yes, it would.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.780]   Well, what am I stealing?
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:42.780]   What specifically am I taking from them?
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:47.780]   You're getting cheap internet services in response, not giving the explicit quid pro quo that they're.
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:49.780]   I'm giving him plenty of information.
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:50.780]   But it's not your information.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:51.780]   So what?
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:54.780]   I actually think John is on to something.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.780]   This is the future of security.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.780]   Everybody thinks you lock it down and make misinformation.
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.780]   That's how you foil these things.
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:03.780]   You don't do it by locking down.
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.780]   This is a.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.780]   Oh, the NSA could never encrypt my encryption.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:07.780]   Oh, really?
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:09.780]   Nobody knows what the NSA is capable of.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.780]   These people.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:12.780]   This is what the, you know, the breaking encryption is what they do.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:13.780]   It's their job.
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:14.780]   But misinformation.
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:16.780]   That's something that's very difficult for anybody to get out of.
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:21.780]   I would just be sending them stuff that I'm spending all my time visiting Christian websites.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:22.780]   That's right.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:24.780]   But then what are the ads you're going to get?
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:28.780]   I'm not going to get any because they're going to be shunted over to a virtual machine.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:33.780]   That's going to be looking at the ads and clicking it on one once in a while that I'll never see.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.780]   Very clever.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.780]   Well, it's not completely academic.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.780]   They're already doing this in Austin.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.780]   They call it Giga power.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:44.780]   And isn't this what Brian Brushwood just got for NSFW?
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.780]   He's getting 500 megabit symmetric, right?
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:47.780]   I think so.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:49.780]   That's a reasonable speed.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.780]   For 70 bucks is that what Brian's paying?
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:52.780]   Probably not.
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:54.780]   Why not?
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:56.780]   Would that kind of speed your servers are going to use it?
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:58.780]   I'd let them put a camera in my bathroom for that kind of speed.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:36:59.780]   Truth is.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.780]   If they want to watch me, you're an A.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:07.780]   You can also get a free HBO HBO for 36 months.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.780]   And HD service $120 a month of qualifying TV service.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.780]   Oh, now they're trying to sell you other stuff.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:12.780]   Yeah, they're up selling you.
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.780]   But you have to sign up for AT&T's Internet Preferences program.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:17.780]   That's the ad.
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:19.780]   Did Brian sign up for that?
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:22.780]   He's paying $100 whatever he signed up for according to somebody's home.
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:24.780]   $100 is a very close follower.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.780]   And it's going to be rolled out fast all over the country.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:32.780]   This is a new service AT&T wants to offer fiber to the home.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:38.780]   You know, Fios, they kind of stopped building out Verizon Fios because they didn't really monetize it.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:39.780]   You know, he could have done this.
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:41.780]   You know, Sonic guy's going to start doing this on his own.
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.780]   I know.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:43.780]   He's picking back.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:44.780]   He's already doing it up in Hillsburg.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:49.780]   He's piggybacking right now on most of the AT&T stuff and you probably continue to do that.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.780]   Look at that.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:51.780]   Look at that.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:52.780]   It's so fast.
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:54.780]   Speed test doesn't even have a big enough dial for it.
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:55.780]   Look at that.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:56.780]   It berrys the needle.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.780]   It berrys the 100 megabits is the most.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:00.780]   It's over 300 megabits he's getting.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.780]   We're going to need a bigger dial.
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:03.780]   We're going to need a bigger dial.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.780]   And we have 25 more bobbleheads.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.780]   We're down to 25, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.780]   Here I give you.
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:13.780]   You should raise the price.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:14.780]   From the 2000.
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.780]   Oh, I have the heaven or words.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:18.780]   Oh, you have to skip in on buns.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.780]   I'm in here.
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.780]   I'm in here.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:21.780]   This was the technical achievement award.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:25.780]   Alan Cumming was the master's term.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.780]   I was actually at this.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:31.780]   This was up at the Masonic auditorium on Knob Hill.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:32.780]   Let's see.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.780]   These are the nominees.
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:35.780]   Desktop.
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:36.780]   Remember them?
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.780]   No, vaguely.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:38.780]   I don't.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:39.780]   Desktop.com.
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.780]   Finally, here we go.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.780]   Google.
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:43.780]   Oh, a big round of applause.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:45.780]   Nobody ever heard of them in the year 2000.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.780]   Yes, they did.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:47.780]   Really?
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:48.780]   Of course.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:49.780]   How old were they in there?
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:50.780]   There were two years old.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:51.780]   No, about three.
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.780]   They were running against the station and Desktop.com.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:59.780]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, the winner for technical achievement, the 2000 Webby Awards.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.780]   She has come to this.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:06.780]   He says it was great scotch accent.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.780]   Good Lord.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:08.780]   And the winner!
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:09.780]   Tedia.
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:10.780]   We and Ava.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:11.780]   Giggle.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.780]   Giggle.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.780]   Giggle.
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.780]   This thing we worked really hard on it.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.780]   Wow.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.780]   Look at Google in the year 2000.
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:22.780]   I've been a friend of myself and we have lots and lots of people who work on it and that's
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:23.780]   the only thing we do.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:24.780]   Very erudite.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.780]   We have more information.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:30.780]   You better get home or his mom's going to be really mad.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.780]   Okay, here we go.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.780]   Okay, now look at the third woman, the woman behind Larry and Sergey.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.780]   She on Skates night.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:36.780]   I think that's Marissa Meyer.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:37.780]   Where should it be?
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:38.780]   Where?
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:39.780]   I don't see it.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.780]   Who's that?
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:41.780]   I don't see a Marissa.
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.780]   Oh, I think that's her.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:44.780]   Is that her?
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:45.780]   No.
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:46.780]   Are you sure?
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.780]   No, that's not her.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:48.780]   No, it's not her.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:49.780]   Okay, never mind.
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:50.780]   Forget I even played that.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.780]   Yeah, we wish.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.780]   224 bobbleheads.
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.780]   I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.780]   I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:55.780]   I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.780]   I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:57.780]   I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:58.780]   Oh, I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.780]   Oh, I think it's going backwards.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.780]   Oh, I think it's going backwards.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.780]   Oh, I think it's going backwards.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:02.780]   Oh, I think it's going backwards.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:03.780]   Oh, I think it's going backwards.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:07.780]   I think it's going backwards.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:08.780]   I'm sure they're returning them.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:09.780]   They're returning them already.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.780]   They're returning the bobbleheads.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:13.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:16.780]   You cannot yet gazelle your bobblehead.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:18.780]   I don't think there's a market on gazelle.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:20.780]   However, you can gazelle your smartphone.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:21.780]   You can ebay it.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.780]   You can ebay it for big dough.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.780]   This is such a limited edition.
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.780]   It's probably going to be, oh, but that would be a forward looking statement.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.780]   I shouldn't do that.
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.780]   Yes, you see.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.780]   You're not an SEC.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:37.780]   It's not that funny.
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:40.780]   Do you have an old surface tablet and like to buy the new one?
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:41.780]   Do you have an old iPad?
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   You'd like to get a new iPhone.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.780]   Do you have an old surface?
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.780]   You like to get a new iPad?
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:46.780]   An old iPad you like to get a new surface?
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:51.780]   If you would like to get rid of your old gadget crap, go to gazelle.com
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:58.780]   and they'll give you cold hard American dollars for your iPhone, your iPad, your old blackberry.
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:00.780]   I bet you, John, you've got lying around.
[01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:05.780]   You've probably got a fourth generation iPad just sitting there that you got last year.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:08.780]   Now you're thinking, I really want to get an iPad Air.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:13.780]   If I could only get some money for my old iPad, it's in good condition.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:14.780]   What's it worth?
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:17.780]   Ladies and gentlemen, 255 bucks.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:18.780]   Wow.
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:19.780]   That's actually pretty good.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:23.780]   Well, for considering it's just a piece of metal plastic.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.780]   Whatever.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.780]   Glass unloved.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:29.780]   They'll buy old iPods, Macbooks, Macs, cinema displays.
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:31.780]   I got an old, old iPod.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.780]   They're not going to sell you.
[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:33.780]   They're not going to buy an old, old iPad.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.780]   The original.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:35.780]   They'll buy a touch of Nano or a classic.
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.780]   They won't buy the old old old ones.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:38.780]   Well, that's...
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:39.780]   They will buy broken iPhones.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:41.780]   So if you've got a crack, screen or broken iPhone, they'll buy those too.
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.780]   Here's the deal.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.780]   You get an offer.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:45.780]   That offer is good for 30 days.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.780]   You do not have to send it back to them yet.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.780]   You've got 30 days to get the new thing.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:53.780]   If you think there's going to be a new thing, like the Nexus 10, any minute now, I think
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:55.780]   the next 30 days is going to be a Nexus 10.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.780]   Maybe get a quote on your old Nexus 10 now, just in case.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.780]   And then when the new Nexus 10 comes out, you can pull the trigger.
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.780]   They will send you a box, pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck, and then
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.780]   send you a check, a PayPal.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:08.780]   Galaxy has three's worth 100 bucks.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.780]   Wow.
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:13.780]   PayPal credit or if you buy stuff on Amazon, get the Amazon gift card.
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:16.780]   They'll bump that up 5%.
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:17.780]   Gazelle.com.
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:20.780]   It's the best way to sell your used stuff.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.780]   If you forget to wipe the data, they will wipe it for you too.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.780]   Gazelle.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.780]   After they copy it.
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:27.780]   No.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:30.780]   Well, first of all, they don't want your data.
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:31.780]   I promise you.
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.780]   Now, if you send it to AT&T, they might want your data.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.780]   I think you want to get all your--
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:36.780]   Wipe your data.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.780]   No, you're right.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:38.780]   I'm just saying.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:39.780]   Wipe your own data.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.780]   Wipe your own data.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:41.780]   Everybody should wipe themselves.
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.780]   But--
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:43.780]   I've always--
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:46.780]   If you forget to wipe yourself, they'll wipe yourself.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.780]   But that's a plus.
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:50.780]   Yeah, because then you don't have to worry about it.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:53.780]   But the bottle hits have really slowed down.
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:55.780]   Yeah, isn't that a shame?
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:58.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.780]   [SCREAMS]
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.780]   Anybody interested at all in a boot and two phone?
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:03.780]   Anybody?
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.780]   No.
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.780]   Nobody.
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:06.780]   Literally nobody.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:07.780]   Just--
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:08.780]   No, he's not.
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:09.780]   I am definitely interested in this.
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.780]   You would have known--
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:15.780]   Did you see that Norway is digitizing all its books and making them free to read online?
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.780]   Take that Google.
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:22.980]   The National Library of Norway is digitizing every book in its collection, processing the
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:25.980]   text to make it searchable, and then saying it's online.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.980]   I guess this is also happening in the UK and Finland.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:28.980]   It's incredible.
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:29.980]   And they're completely ignorant.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:30.980]   UK?
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:32.980]   Things like copyright and things like that.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:33.980]   They're just--
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:34.980]   How dare they?
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.980]   They're the government.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:40.980]   Librarians estimate the digitization-- digitization of the entire collection, which goes back to the
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.980]   middle ages will take-- take a guess.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:43.980]   Ten years.
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:44.980]   Twenty to thirty years.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.980]   Wow.
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:48.980]   It should let Google get a heads of the item.
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:50.980]   You know what is actually kind of interesting?
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:52.980]   England did this.
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:55.980]   They let Microsoft scan-- what was it?
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:01.980]   Was it a British magazine collection or newspaper collection?
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:06.980]   And they have now posted all of the scans-- Microsoft gave it back to them after they scanned it.
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:08.980]   Why did this happen?
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:09.980]   Because Microsoft gave up on the scan--
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:11.980]   They gave up and said, "Just take the crap."
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.980]   They not only gave up and they gave all the stuff through in the public domain, literally.
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.980]   Gave a bunch of it to archive.org.
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:18.980]   They just gave it away.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:21.980]   And then they abandoned all the scanners.
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:23.980]   So if the library had a scanner, they gave it to them.
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:25.980]   What kind of thinking is this?
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:28.980]   Well, I think they were trying to compete with Google and then they realized.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:32.980]   So the British Library had millions of images.
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:34.980]   All of them are now on Flickr.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.980]   And what they're trying to do, this is on what they call Flickr's--
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.980]   No, this is nice.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.980]   Flickr.com/BritishLibrary.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.980]   And they want a crowd source, what this stuff is.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:45.980]   I mean, this is amazing stuff.
[01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:51.980]   This is taken from page 111 of "Through Massiah Land Third Edition."
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:53.980]   Shouldn't they have a caption?
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:55.980]   Maybe they should have shot the picture with the caption.
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.980]   I know they probably should have shot more of it.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:58.980]   They probably should have shot more of it.
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:44:59.980]   They probably should have shot more of it.
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:01.980]   This is a page 134 of "Swindon" 50 years ago.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:02.980]   A "Swindon."
