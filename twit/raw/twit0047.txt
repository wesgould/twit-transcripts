[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech episode 47, from March 26th, 2006.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [Music]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Joining us now via ISDNY, so high tech, it's the latest thing from 1992.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Doug K.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I guess if you have nothing good to say you might as well at least sound good.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Sounding fantastic, practically like you're in studio.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   From Skype, we have John C. de Vorak.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Hello.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   How you doing?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And Patrick Norton as well, who is seeing red sniper dots on the window pane.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Is everything okay now, Patrick?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   It's just the neighbor starting her construction project again.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Now they can fire it back up.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Welcome everybody.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   We had invited Robert Scobull of Microsoft Corporation to join us to talk about our top story.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   But he can't make it, maybe we'll get him back next week.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Actually, there's a bunch of Microsoft news.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   The biggest story, of course, is that Vista Consumer Edition won't be out until early 2007.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Business Edition comes out late 2006, has planned.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   That just makes me laugh.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Why would they release it?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Clearly, nobody in business is going to adopt it until the Consumer Edition is out, right?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Is it just so they can test it?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I don't think that's true.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   What's the rationale?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Why release the... what is the story?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Why are they doing this?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.600]   Well, I mean, the word on the street is that they have some multimedia issues in the main
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.000]   part of the code because they want to incorporate all this cool stuff.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   No, I don't know.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I mean, the whole thing sounds a little fishy to me.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I mean, it's not as though they haven't done this before.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.800]   There's one rumor on the net that says it suggests that it's possibly some licensing deals
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.280]   haven't been signed off on and then maybe it's going to be harder to get them to sign
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   off on them because Microsoft doesn't like the license anything.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.000]   And when time says it's a big yawn, everybody's happy with XP.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I don't know about that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Well, that's my question too.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.680]   I mean, take a look at an IT department.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.800]   These guys have fought for years to get something stable and like it or not, they've got something
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   stable.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.000]   I can't think of anything worse than having to get rid of XP and go to Vista.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.120]   Well, and in fact, that was the same issue happened with Windows 2000.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.000]   I think they were very reluctant to go to XP.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah, well, it took a long time.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   A lot of them didn't.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Microsoft has to light a fire and I have to say, well, you're not going to get updates.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   How many times have you in somebody's office and they fire up the computer and there's
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   Windows 2?
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   Well, I had my choice.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   That would be the version I'd be using.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   Really?
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   So, you know, we all assume that every few years there's a new major version of Windows
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.880]   and that we're all going to follow.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.440]   And I wonder if that eventually breaks and we just stopped doing it at some point.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.720]   Well, one of the things I have an issue with is that what's the difference?
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.800]   I mean, what are you going to, what is Vista bringing to the party?
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   Well, Patrick, you played with it more than anybody else.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   What do you think?
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   Oh, boy.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   So, no user interface.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.840]   They've taken out most of the really innovative stuff like the file system.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.240]   Well, the, I mean, in terms of what the end user would notice, it would be interesting
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   to see if they plan to ship the file system after Vista ships whenever Vista ships dot
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.400]   dot dot.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.040]   You know, the interface, they're trying to clean it up and really make it, I think, more
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.880]   OS 10-like.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.400]   They're trying to root out the security problems.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.800]   I think they keep coming back to these days is that it's going to be more secure.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.120]   It's going to be better.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.720]   You know, and everybody kind of looks at each other and nods their head and says, "Aha."
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.880]   We believe you.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.320]   That's definitely your goal.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.240]   In terms of usage, it kind of reminds me a lot of going from '95 to '98 or '98 to
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.840]   XP only maybe not so dramatic.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.760]   You know, some new icons, some new desktop action, the start button's gone.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.880]   But what I think users are crying for is a more secure operating system.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.040]   They hope that it will have been rewritten greatly so that it's safer and more robust
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   and less prone to spyware and infestation, right?
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.760]   Well, that's one of the things they've done is if you install it yourself and you basically
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.440]   enable everything and once you do enable, one of the more amusing aspects is that it
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.560]   asks your permission before it does anything.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.200]   So you go to change the screen size, you get a screen size, screen resolution, you get
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   a dialogue box back.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   It's like, "Did you do this?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   Do you want us to use the screen?
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   Are you ready?
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   Are you wanting to do this?"
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.880]   Well, but it's also maybe the only way they can lock everything down at some levels.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.600]   The flip side is it's going to be, you know, application 4* Z7X473.exe has asked if it can
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.360]   do something to something DLL, at which point, you know.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.240]   The user doesn't know what they're talking about.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.640]   And you know, I'm almost expecting it to say, you know, when you're in a Word document
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.120]   saying "Cut and paste, are you sure you want to cut and paste?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.960]   Is this how you do the one doing the cut and paste?"
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.000]   Microsoft has done this bad, but it's close.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.360]   They've done this before.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   I mean, they've had some annoying, you know, you're sure you wanted delete messages in
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.520]   the past.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   People just disable them.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.080]   I also think that they can, you know, there's a balance.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.360]   And one of the reasons Mac is safer is because it does ask your permission before it makes
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.760]   any system changes.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.600]   Well, hey, I have an idea.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   What's that?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.400]   Maybe they should just toss the whole thing and come up with an operating system that
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.560]   doesn't use this ridiculous registry, centralized registry.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.360]   I mean, this is so communistic.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   It's unbelievable.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.840]   It's like the Polit Bureau.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   Does Vista still have a registry, Patrick?
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   It might.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.640]   I would do so.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.760]   It never occurred to me that they would walk away from that model.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   Of course, it would break every program in existence if it didn't.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   So I guess it would have to.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.880]   It says XP has some support for wind.any and system.any, just in case.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.240]   Yeah, but I agree with John.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.600]   I think the registry is one of the things that bothers me most about all of those recent
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   windows operating systems.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   And it's very trouble.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   What?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   Ag explained to us why the registry is such an issue.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   Well, the biggest problem for me is that I can't get rid of things.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   You know, if I have a piece of software and I don't like it, you know, there are remnants
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.560]   in the registry that I have a hell of a time getting rid of.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.200]   You have one centralized file.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   It's fairly opaque.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's actually a number of files, but it looks like one central file with everything in it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.400]   And it, if you uninstall a program, you have to modify the registry.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.280]   If you install a program, you have to modify the registry.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   That makes it less robust.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   It means getting rid of traces of a program are much more difficult because it's hidden
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.400]   away in this opaque file.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.520]   It's why spy spyware loves the registry because they can put all sorts of things in the registry.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.920]   And it's frankly fragile.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.720]   I don't know if it is a very good way of doing what they're doing.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.160]   I think it's an interesting thing.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.140]   We'll see B2C the uptake on the OEMs and when either version starts coming out, to what
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.080]   extent they offer both XP and VIST on new machines.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   There was a great little controversy going on because an Australian IT Journal Smarthouse
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.840]   on Friday published a story claiming internal sources at Microsoft saying that 60% of the
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.280]   Windows Vista code had to be rewritten.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.360]   Microsoft immediately denied it and said in fact there are, it's not being rewritten.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.760]   There are no code changes in the Vista code base.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   Because they're using that proven Windows XP code.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.240]   It's been working on this thing since the year 2002 or what?
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   It's 1990, I think.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.480]   You know, it's like how are you going to do 60% in nine or 10 months?
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.040]   It's not going to be doable.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.160]   So I mean, that story seemed a little ludicrous.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160]   Yeah, I think it's bogus.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.200]   I think a couple of people sort of did the math and said, well, what's the cost of rewriting
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.480]   60% of every line of code in the Windows operating system?
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.280]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.600]   Now then again, it may have just been a criticism.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.080]   Maybe it should be rewritten.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   Exactly.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.480]   It didn't mean they're going to rewrite it.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.800]   They just, somebody came up and said, 60% of this code is crap.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.360]   It needs to be rewritten.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.400]   Well, you know, I've been told by Microsoft Insiders from a year ago that when they threw
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.240]   out the file system that that was actually not the first version of the file system,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.720]   they'd gone back to the drawing board at least twice to rewrite the thing.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.280]   That you know, it wouldn't be the first time they've tossed out code and said, we've got
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   to start over.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   It's not doing it.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.680]   And in fact, I think that's probably why they pulled the, you know, what is it called,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.760]   WinFS or the new file system out?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.280]   Well, you know, I go ahead.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.560]   Well, I started about six months ago and I was at a meeting with a dinner meeting with
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.480]   Jim Alchen, Robert Skobel was there and you know, they gave a big fancy demo of Vesta.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.440]   And I turned to the guy next to me and I said, you know, don't we really already have most
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.520]   of this stuff in OS 10?
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.640]   And I think the thing that they were so excited about, well, let's see, you know, visual windows
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.360]   that you could see through translucent windows.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.720]   Alpha channel, yeah.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.200]   And then the equivalent of spotlight, I forget what they call it in WinFS.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.720]   I said, you know, we've gotten used to this already.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.400]   What was their response?
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   I didn't say that out loud.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.760]   Oh, you're the first one.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.760]   You should have had me there.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   I would have said it.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   Yeah, I bet you would have.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.760]   Well, it's been said now.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.760]   And by a lot.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.440]   Of course, I wouldn't have been there.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:38.240]   So this is, you know, related, I guess there's a huge exploit going down or number of exploits
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   now zero day exploits on a real flaw in an internet explorer.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.760]   We're back again to this.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.040]   The so-called create text range flaw.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.440]   Microsoft says they're working as fast as they can to provide a patch and name if necessary
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.880]   will do a, you know, an instant patch instead of waiting till April 11th, their normal patch
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   date.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.040]   There are this, there are already, this was discovered on Thursday, there are already
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:10.240]   hundreds of websites, according to search security.com, hundreds of websites that are
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.160]   exploiting this flaw.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.720]   And which versions of IE are affected?
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Do we know?
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.900]   I don't know if IE7 is vulnerable, but I think it's a lot of people who are
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.360]   going to be able to do that.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.840]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.440]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.280]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.520]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.680]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.120]   So, there's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   I think it's a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   This is the...
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.440]   Secuny discovered it.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.040]   It's an error in how the Create Text Range Method is processed on a radio button control.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.880]   You have to go to a website with a radio button control.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.520]   This can be exploited by a malicious website to corrupt memory in a way that allows the
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.920]   program flow to be redirected to the heap.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.480]   This is a traditional way of buffer overflow.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.400]   Arbitrary code could be executed.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.760]   The code would be to put something like SD-BOT in your system.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.400]   Apparently, it's spreading like wildfire.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.760]   It's spreading like wildfire by the poor unfortunate souls who use Windows IE instead of Firefox
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   or Opera.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   That's right.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   We've been saying this for a long time.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.760]   Don't use IE.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.760]   Ears.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.760]   Huh?
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.120]   We've been saying it for years.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   Years.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   Ooh, Opera.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120]   Use Firefox.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   Do not use Windows IE.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.120]   That's what it says.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   It's the target.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120]   There are two...
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.480]   Incidentally, two other serious flaws that are being investigated right now.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.280]   Microsoft says users can protect themselves by configuring IE to prompt before running
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.200]   active scripting or by disabling active scripting in the internet and local internet security
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.440]   zones or set your security to high, which means most of the websites you go to won't
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   work.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.240]   Those are separate attacks.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.040]   That's not the same as this text area overflow.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.120]   No, this is another one.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.400]   Just all the more reasons for Firefox.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.960]   Yeah, it's just a mess.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.680]   Didn't know us tend to... or Apple do a pretty large group of updates for OS 10s.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   They did.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680]   They did.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.280]   There were some pretty serious flaws in OS 10 and as far as anybody knows, Apple doesn't
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.840]   tell you what they're patching, but as far as anyone knows, it looks like they patched
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   those flaws.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:54.760]   Anyway, kind of an interesting mess for Microsoft between delay of Vista and these Trojan horses.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.200]   You've got to think that...
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.880]   This is more of what you were saying, John, that Microsoft's just really struggling right
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   now.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.640]   Yeah, I don't like to see it, but I do have the sense that they're dead in the water.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.120]   I think that Bill's going to have to come back to work or something.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.280]   I'm not absolutely sure what the problem is.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.120]   You know, Alchin, by the way, had already announced that he was going to retire when
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   Vista ships.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.480]   He says even though Vista's not shipping until 2007, he's still going to retire in 2006 and
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.640]   Steve Sinov's was going to take over.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.680]   He was the program manager for the office team.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.320]   I thought he was a marketing... the new guy's a marketing guy.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.520]   He's not a technical guy.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   No, well, he started as a programmer.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   So he leads the...
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   Turn marketing.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   Yeah, probably turn marketing.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.040]   I guess when you lead a team, like the office team, it's...
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.240]   I don't know this guy, so he may be a genius for all I know.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.320]   But I do know that years ago, you started to see this erosion of the really best coders
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.840]   over at Microsoft all getting sick of being bossed around and deciding that they should
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.480]   be managers.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.920]   And I've talked to a number of people that have seen this phenomenon over there.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.840]   And it's, I think, an inevitable situation where you have a bunch of old programmers.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.560]   You can't really program at a high level when they get to be 30 and not no offense to you
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.320]   coders out there who are in your 30s.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.520]   But generally speaking, you know, all these kids who can spend all night and eat pizza
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.160]   and live off of diet coke or coke are probably, you know, really the bread and butter for
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   the...
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.000]   They're all doing their Web 2.0 companies now.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.760]   Well, the point is, though, at Microsoft, is these guys were like either going to quit
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.840]   and do that or they wanted to be... you know, these guys are like engineers.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.240]   They want to become the boss.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   Right.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.800]   They don't want to just be designers or coders or be pushed around by guys who don't know
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.960]   what they're talking about.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.760]   The problem is they have no management skills.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.120]   So you have Microsoft filled up with that kind of situation from what I can tell.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.720]   MSN says that... actually it's an associate press story.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.320]   It was published by MSN that Apple could be the big winner from the Windows delay because
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.800]   when people go into stores in Christmas time, there won't be any Vista computers and people.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.520]   I don't think that's a bogus story.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.760]   Who's going to... what general member of the public is going to...
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.280]   Oh, God, there's no Vista.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.400]   I'm not going to buy a computer.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   I'll buy a Mac.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   I just don't see that happening.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.160]   I think you make the decision about what you're going to buy before you go to the store.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   It's like...
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   You're buying a Windows box or you're buying a Mac.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   That's right.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.440]   And the only issue is, does that Windows box come with XP or Vista?
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.080]   And for now... well, for now, there's no choice.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.200]   There'll be a period where you can get either and then you'll be...
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   Don't you think people want to wait...
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   I think the public cares.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.400]   I don't think the public even knows what Vista is.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   Exactly.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   We're talking to...
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   Our exact...
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   audience, you know, in ourselves, you know, we know, but that's about it.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   Small audience.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.880]   I think the key, though, is that the upgrade licenses are going to be disappointing for
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.880]   Microsoft.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   I think that's...
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.560]   Well, that's the big source of revenue for that.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.240]   That's kind of key to the whole enterprise.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.160]   And the longer they wait, the longer they're counting on it.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.760]   Dell has purchased Alienware.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   What is...
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   What is Alienware?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.640]   Alienware makes a high-end gaming machine.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.000]   They're very expensive.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.120]   You get a good Alienware box, like, 7 grand.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   And the big margins...
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.280]   Well, they're not all that expensive, but they're one of the first boutique gaming machine
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   vendors.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   Right.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.000]   Obviously, Dell, who has tried to do gaming platforms, but they just don't have the cache
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.480]   of somebody like Alienware.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   You know, why is Alienware...
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   You know, why is Alienware...
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.640]   Does that have the cache of Alienware anymore?
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.800]   What is Dell getting out of this deal?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.120]   What is Alienware?
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   What can they do that Dell can't do?
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.400]   They can sell a computer at a 100% markup.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   That's what they can do.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.240]   Well, I mean, Dell makes their money from other things.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.640]   But the thing is, is that I just don't get it personally.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.640]   I mean, Dell could have created their own Alienware company.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   And, you know, then...
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.200]   You know what it does?
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   Is it allows...
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.880]   I mean, this is like a proctoring gamble move.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.800]   It allows them to have a different name and a different branding and access to some other
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   channels.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.840]   Because, at this point, Alienware is so far from what they were five years ago.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.000]   You know, their entry level gaming machines started like 780, 670 bucks, something like
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   that.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   There's, you know, they're...
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But they have a reputation...
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   They have a cool vase in...

[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   They have a cool vase in...

[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   They have a cool vase in...

[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   They have a cool vase in...
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   They have all the obvious stuff...
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Photo galleries and mail...
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   I think they're going to do a...
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   The mapping is pretty good.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   The mapping actually may be better than...
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Google's, actually.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   Really?
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It'll be interesting to watch them.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   There's a lot of nifty features inside of the Google.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   I'll forward you a link for the...
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   For the mapping stuff that's in there.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   They do really good search.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   They do pinpoints.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   They have like this widget thing so that you can...
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   You can put like...
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Dictionary, NASA's image of the day...
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   That kind of stuff in there.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Right.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   It's pretty gadget gallery.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Pretty cool.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   There's no reason why they couldn't put a voice over the Internet button in there and all sorts of stuff.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   They're interesting to watch.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   The Windows Live local is pretty cool.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Gadget gallery is kind of back and forth on.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   It's nice to have the dictionary in there, but...
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   It'll be interesting to watch when they make it easy to customize them a little bit more.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   It's always fine like Google's personal homepage a little easier to add stuff to.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Yeah, it's typical Google thing.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   It's a little more stripped down.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   I just opened the safety center on Live and it says, "Oops, we seem to be having a problem with this feed.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Please try again later."
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   They can't even get...
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Photo page is pretty funny looking.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Photo page is amazing, isn't it?
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   This thing is...
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I mean, it's just so festive.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   You know, I think what it really is a testament to is how good browsers have become, how powerful a browser is now.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   And it really, if I were Microsoft or Apple or any operating systems manufacturer, I'd be a little worried.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Really, more and more of the operating system is just a host for a good browser.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Yeah, but the problem is if you are all offline.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Well, that's right.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Totally.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   That's what we just talked about with Flickr, if they go away, all my pictures are gone too.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   So, Leo, what's your personal default homepage?
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   NetVibes.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   Oh, isn't it?
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Yeah, he's NetVibes.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   How about you, John?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Mine is devorect.org/home.html.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Oh, you gave so close to a fourth plug.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Oh, I'm really worried.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It was no, slash home.html.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   No, you're talking about... you wanted me to say devorect.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Never mind.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   You've actually done this for a while, the home.html.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   I've done that home.html page since about 1994.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   It's still all text.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   And it just does a lot of links.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   And it looks like 1994.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Although I see...
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   It's Web.9.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   I like that.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Mine's actually a page on my laptop, on my computer.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Yeah, that's kind of what John does.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   John does that, I think, probably on his computers, too.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   He has a local page.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   And that's what this came from, right?
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   John was originally your local page.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Yeah, no, it's a local page.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And I tell people how to make it a local page.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And a lot of people have actually used it.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   And as their local page... I don't have... I mean, I look at the numbers.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I have about... this is compared to the blog.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   This is a low number thing because it's old-fashioned.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   They probably have about 2,500 or maybe 3,000 people that use it routinely.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   That's interesting.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   How about you, Patrick?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   What's your home page?
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Usually, whatever website I'm working on at the time.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Yeah, I sometimes will do that because if I have to go back to that page a lot, I'll just...
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   It's either generally Google search or LTV or Xtreme.com.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   That's the deal.tv for those of you that have to be there.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   You're breaking up so that the plug that you just gave sounded like...
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   Yeah, I'll say it for you.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   DL.tv, which is where Cranky Geeks is as well now.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Have you done more than one shows?
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Yeah, we've done three.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Oh, great.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Cranky Geeks says it's own home page.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   We're still Cranky.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   CrankyGeeks.com, right?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Is that right?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Yeah, and actually the one guy gets credit for being the most cranky.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   We should have him on the Twitch show once in a while.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Is Sebastian Rupply?
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   I like Sebastian.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Yeah, you know, he'd like to do the show.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   We should have him as a backup guy.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   He's more than welcome.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   I won't tell people what happened on Friday.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Well, I will tell people what happened on Friday.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   We were scheduled to do this show live in the studio.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   It's just one of those days.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Everybody got busy or whatever.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   But in quick succession, an hour or two before tape time,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   I got emails from everybody saying, "Can't make it."
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   So it's going to be me and Doug.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Yeah, and Leo was not too pleased.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   It wasn't.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   It was like, "Wait a minute.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   We got a..."
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   And I don't blame you.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   We had all these guys lined up.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   You had like seven people lined up and none of them showed up,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   including myself.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Actually, actually there were two confirmed and four potentials,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   three of whom were potential and whether or not I would drive them up to court.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Oh, that's what happened.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   It was all they were all looking for a ride from Patrick.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   And then I was a wreck and I didn't trust driving up there.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   That's okay.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   It's okay.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   As a result though, I mean, I want...
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Nobody's making any money on this yet.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   I'm hoping we will at some point.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   But since we're all volunteering our time,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   I don't want to take more time than we need to.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   So we'll probably keep doing this via Skype for a while
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   and do occasional live ones.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   If you want to see...
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   If you want to see John or Patrick, there's plenty of ways you can see them on DLTV and cranky.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   And you can also go to the blogs.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   But the other thing, we might want...
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I think we need to get...
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Although you did when when I was gone, I think getting back into one of these studios,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   audience situations about once every couple months,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I think would be a really good idea.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   I think we'll do that.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Enjoy.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And we...
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Doug said this.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   We were one of the few podcasts that actually did a live show.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And that is certainly something we've done.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Quite a few of them.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   But it might be interesting.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   We have next time there's a bloggers conference or something.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   We can get like...
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Then you want to get your Robert Scoble in.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Right.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   He would be kind of interesting to start a large group.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Yeah, we can start doing some of that.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   And we can have more people too.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   A little update on our web redesign.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   It's progressing along very well.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   I want to thank the folks at Lullabot.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   What happened is we...
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   I went to Amber MacArthur and her team at ArcType
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   and they did a beautiful design for me.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   But because we use Drupal, which is a content management system on Twit.tv,
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   it then had to be kind of engineered.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   You know, the back end had to be done.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And I went to Lullabot, which is just a fantastic group of people.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   L-U-L-L-A-B-O-T.com.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   And the reason I'm giving them a big plug is because we ran out of money.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   We couldn't pay them.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   And I said, "Look, you know, guys, we appreciate it.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   We'll just have to get back to you in a few months."
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And they're doing it pro bono right now.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   So I thank you very much, Lullabot.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And if you're looking for a Drupal design or any work of any kind,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Jeff Robbins, Matt Westgate, Ted Curbinsky, Ted's really working hard on this.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   And it's looking great.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   How do you like Drupal, by the way?
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Love it.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I hate it.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   You hate it?
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Why do you dislike it?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Drupal's sort of like a religion.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   It is.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   It is.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   It's very much a cult.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   And I'm in the cult.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Yeah, but you get developers and you ask them to do something,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   and the first thing you say is, "Well, how can we Drupalize your idea?"
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Well, you kind of know.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   But that's true with every content management system.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   I don't think that's true.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Doug, have you played with Joomla?
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   No, I haven't.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   I played with it a little bit, but I don't have an opinion on it.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   I'm one worthy of it.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Joomla, I play with the...
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   I have the earlier version, Mambo.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And I...
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Mambo, I know you.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Mambo is the same thing.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   I totally eat Mambo, I'll be honest with you.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   I can see why, because it's very difficult to get into.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   But once you're into it, it's extremely powerful.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   The other thing is, I think Drupal's code base is a little bit,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   and a little bit is a lot cleaner than anything else out there.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   It's well-written code.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And it has a lot more modules.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   It seems very well-supported.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   But that's the old sweet versus best-of-breed argument.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   And when we got into it for the Conversations Network,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   we found out right away that Drupal was able to solve 20% of our problems
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   and the 80% that was hard, we had to do ourselves anyway.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Yeah, that might be.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   So what are you using?
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   It's all handwritten.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   It's all PHP.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   But it's not important that it's PHP, what's important is that it's not using anybody's canned code.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   What was Drupal not able to do that you needed?
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   No, it couldn't handle podcasts.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   It couldn't handle audio.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   It handles podcasts very well now, by the way.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Well, it doesn't have a good system for handling large objects in general.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   So the actual handling of the MP3 files.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Also, we have a system where we do show assembly every night.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Every night we build over thousands of programs in our archives.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   Yeah, you do a lot of stuff.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   And what's your URL?
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   ITconversations.com.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Yeah, ITconversations are the best place to find this.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   And that, oh, I should also plug the conversationsnetwork.org.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   That's the other one, conversationsnetwork.org.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   But we had to do things that Drupal just wasn't even close to.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   And we got a whole bunch of Drupal developers in.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   We decided to make an open source project.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   So this is--
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   What's the name of this open source project?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Well, it's conversationsnetwork.org.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   It was the content management system.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   But we killed it.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   We killed it because what happened is the Drupal people got all excited about it and tried to shoehorn it into the Drupal architecture and it just made it incredibly cumbersome.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Well, we'll see.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   One of the things Lullibot is doing, one of the reasons I'm excited about Lullibot is what we're hoping to do.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   There's a Drupal distribution right now for nonprofits called CivicSpace, which is very good.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   And it makes it very easy for a nonprofit to get a very nice looking website up quickly with all the features they want.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   And I'd like to do that for podcasting.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   And so one of the things I've talked about with Lullibot is maybe taking the work that they do for us and then generalizing it and giving it away as CivicSpace is given away.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   Yeah, I think it's good for you. It wasn't good for us because we're all about that content management system.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   We're all about producing 60 podcasts a week.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Could you do a huge amount?
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Yeah, I mean, I would just give 10 or 20 podcasts.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   I don't need to do anything like that.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   I'm beasley, 10 or 20.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   But anyway, we're talking about designers, a special hello to Dorothy.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Oh, and that's very important. I really want to mention that, yeah.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Our friend Dorothy Amumoto, who's in the hospital trying to recover from cancer.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   She is the woman who did the incredible Twit logo, the little Twit guy.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   And it was quite sudden.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   She went in for a routine checkup, had blood work done and they found something.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   So, yeah, Dorothy, I know she's listening and our thoughts are with you, our prayers are with you and get better soon.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   We're sending her a DVD player with all sorts of podcasts, right?
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Yeah, and God got the box right here.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Oh, great. What did you choose?
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Hang on, let me see it.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   We wanted to get one that would play MP3s and Divicks as well so that we could center.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   I didn't even open the box.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   It's a Phillips.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   So, will it do? It does MP3s, yeah?
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   It does MP3s. It does Divicks.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   It creates all the different formats in the art that many of the do-em all.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   So, our thoughts are with you, Dorothy. Get better.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   We also thank the folks at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for the podcast and broadcasting us on our AOL radio channel and the podcast channel at AOL.com/
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   podcasting.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   John's available, of course, at dvorak.org/blog and crankygeeks.com.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   You can do a crankygeeks blog. You should, John.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Oh, please.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Crankygeeks is a blog. It's a video blog.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   It's a video blog. There you go.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   And, of course, DL.tv for Patrick's Fantastic Show.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   And, by the way, Prager and Kevin are here, but I understand that "Control Alt Chicken" has released its first episode.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Really?
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Yeah. That's Alex Olliek's cooking show.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   By the way, has anybody seen that?
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Or, no, the story behind that Jack Black movie that's sort of that...
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Not Joe. Not Joe Libre?
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   No, that thing with the...
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Is the rest of it?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   With the motorcycle.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   It's like a movie you can...
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Or, it's like a half hour sitcom and it's like that we kind of grabbed from YouTube.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Huh.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   There's a lot of Jack Black stuff.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   It's actually quite funny, but it's like, what is it?
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Well, you never know with Jack. He's always got these products projects going on.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   You know, he's buddies with Liam Lynch we've had on the screen savers and the...
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   You know, what's the name of his band?
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Tenacious D. He's got a lot of wacky things going on.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   And, he's got a new movie out. He's got a podcast based around the movie.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Interesting. I don't know.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   We have the founder of YouTube, one of the founders of YouTube on Inside the Net coming up on Tuesday.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Interesting interview.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   There's an example of a Web 2.0 company that just took off overnight.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Amazing.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   And can you imagine their bandwidth bill?
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   That'd be pretty scary.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Yeah, it would be. Chicken Corn on Blue, by the way, is the recipe for this first edition of
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   "Control Walt Chicken." I haven't watched it, but I can't.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   Alex Albrecht's cooking show.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   That'll be fun.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   It should be interesting. Look at the formats they put it out in.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   H.264, Theora, W.M.V.XVid, M4V.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   How many different formats do you put out DLTV in?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Not that many.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   Geez.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Well, what's cool though, with the Rev3 guys are done, is they have automated that whole process.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   So, I was going to say they must have some magic because...
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Yeah, Ron, their tech genius is basically scripted together.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   A bunch of boxes off of Linux that allows them to just...
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   They've all got it on our own.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   Yeah, it's not quite that clean, but it's awfully close, as my understanding is.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   This week in tech.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Alright guys, well, it's been a pleasure. Thank you for joining us for another edition of
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   "This Week in Tech." We'll be back next week, and I'm hoping Microsoft will join us.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Give us the inside dirt.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   Now we definitely won't.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Now we'll never hear from him.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Have a great week guys.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Another tweet is in the dead.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   This one.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   This one.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   This one.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   In tech.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   This one.
