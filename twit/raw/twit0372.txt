[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.440]   I thank John Seedevourak for filling in.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.800]   But I'm back, baby.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.840]   And we've got lots to talk about and a great panel
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.760]   to do it with starting to my left with Mr. Mack.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.680]   Actually, you're now editorial director
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.280]   for all of IDG publications.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   Jason Snell.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.760]   Hi.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.600]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.280]   New World, Mac World, Tech Hive.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.120]   And Tech Hive, the new site launched last week.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.080]   Oh, congratulations.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.120]   So what is Tech Hive?
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640]   It's a little different than a--
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.360]   It's not exactly like a magazine or it's-- what is it?
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   It's another-- it's a tech website like Mac World and PC World,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.080]   but about more general technology stuff.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.120]   So cameras, phones, tablets, the web, social media,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.840]   sort of trying to do what PC World and Mac World have always
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.720]   done, but being able to spread our wings a little bit.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.160]   I really like it.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.000]   Look at that.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.320]   Very interesting.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.520]   Good folks at Mule Design helped us design them.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.040]   I was judging it by the way it used to look.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.960]   Which is just kind of a generic WordPress product.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.640]   Yeah, it was pretty much--
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   Watch this space.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.480]   You fooled me.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   It will be a site here eventually.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.160]   It's beautiful.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.280]   Tech Hive.com.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   Well, it's good to have you back, Jason.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.160]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.400]   Usually have them on Mac break weekly,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.200]   but this is a good time for you to be on the show.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.880]   We'll explain why in a moment.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   Also with us, also very good time to have them.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.600]   From gadget.com, Peter Rojas.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.280]   Good to have you, Peter.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.080]   Yeah, it's great to be back.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.480]   Long time observer of the tech scene.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.560]   Yeah, for a lot.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   I've been in the game for way longer than I
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.760]   like to admit at this point.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.440]   Well, good.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.560]   We have something to talk about with you too.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.360]   And I am so pleased to welcome Molly Woodback
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.960]   for the first time in months.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.880]   Hello.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.000]   It's wonderful to be back.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.920]   It has been ages.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.680]   It has been ages.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.240]   And I haven't had a chance to congratulate you
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.720]   on Always On, which is really good.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   Thank you.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.160]   I don't think--
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.680]   That is nice of you.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.400]   I don't know.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.280]   I don't think Peter Rojas jumped out of a plane with an HTC
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.120]   one.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.960]   I don't think Jason Snell jumped out of a plane.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.200]   But Molly Wood jumped out of a plane.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.600]   That's true.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.840]   A helicopter, actually.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.920]   Why a helicopter?
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.880]   It seems that would be more dangerous.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.960]   I think so.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.520]   So we worked with GoPro.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.120]   And their stunt team actually set up the logistics for us
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.360]   and jumped alongside of us.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   We were recreating that HTC One X commercial, where he jumps
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.960]   out of the plane to test the camera and try
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.600]   to do a fashion shoot in midair.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.560]   And I think, apparently, the whole stunt community
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.720]   is way into jumping out of helicopters,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.400]   because you can be more precise with your landing zones.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.960]   And they like that you can climb out onto the struts
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.080]   like vision impossible.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.440]   It's like base jumping.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.280]   So let me--
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.680]   It's a lot like base jumping.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800]   And in fact, then the free fall sensation
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.400]   is way more intense than an airplane,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.760]   because you're basically jumping from a standstill, which
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.000]   is when I discovered that I do not have this stomach for that
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.520]   at all.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   Oh.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.160]   No.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.680]   In fact, I can't even watch the footage now
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   without getting a little bit of not--
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.880]   Had you jumped out of an airplane or a flying vehicle
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   of any kind ever before?
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   No.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.720]   What are you nuts?
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   Where--
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.280]   I'm excited that this one might as well be for work.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.720]   And that looks like a familiar person you're
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.240]   jumping with.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   Is that Jeff Kanata?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.560]   Is Jeff Kanata?
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.360]   He has been an always on correspondent for us.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.600]   He's done a couple of pieces.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.840]   We tortured tested the Nexus 7 together.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.760]   And then we flew him up so that he could jump with his iPhone.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.280]   So we could do a comparison, a head-to-head comparison,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.880]   with the HTC One X and the iPhone camera.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.120]   I would have loved to have been at the editorial meeting
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.200]   where somebody said, hey, Molly, what
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.080]   if you jumped out of a helicopter for this?
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.160]   It was-- the GoPro people came up with it, actually.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.720]   One of our producers and friends was someone who
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.960]   works at GoPro.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   And they were like, what can we do?
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.480]   And you know, it was the same guys,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.080]   the guys that we jumped with are the same guys who
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.120]   did the Google Glasses jump for Google.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.480]   Ah, Nate, that was cool.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.680]   That total nerd gasm.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.120]   I'm like, oh my god, you guys are famous.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.440]   They were superstars, yeah.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.120]   So you're very brave.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.640]   I don't think it spoils anything to say
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.360]   that you did not squish on the ground.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.280]   No, we didn't die.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.880]   Molly survived the jump.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.080]   This is all via tape.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.320]   Today, so it's possible that he-- no, he didn't die either.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.640]   I love it that the instructions show you a banana.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.880]   This is how you jump out of an airplane.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.160]   It was a good day.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.040]   It was a good day of work.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   That was crazy.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   What fun?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.920]   What fun.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.480]   There they go out of the helicopter.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.320]   Were you buddy jumping?
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.520]   You didn't do it by yourself.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.360]   Total tandem.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280]   I don't-- I mean, that was kind of--
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.800]   it's always reassuring to be with class A professionals
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.400]   anyway.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.160]   So the GoPro team is super reassuring
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.920]   because they jump out of off of whatever, like nine times a day.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.000]   And then I'm sort of strapped onto a super efficient German guy.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.960]   Well, if you're going to ride anybody from 30,000 feet down
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.240]   to the grad, you want it to be a super efficient German guy.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.560]   I did too, you know?
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.640]   And he got it done, man.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.240]   He made sure that I was doing the whole time.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.440]   You're here.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.600]   Jump out of the plane now.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.400]   Yeah, because you don't have time to be to throw up.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.360]   You don't have time to fall up.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.680]   We're going to practice our landing,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.320]   and then you need to upload your photos.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.360]   Well, I think that's really cool.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.480]   And I'm always on.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.120]   It's at cnet.com/alwayson if you want to watch.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   It's the most recent episode.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   I don't know if you proved anything, but it's a lot of fun.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.800]   You proved that the commercial actually is--
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   It's doable.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.160]   We would not prove.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.800]   The chat room said that my mic is annoying them,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.760]   so I'm moving around.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.000]   Good.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.840]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.240]   Do everything the chat room says.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.080]   OK.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.840]   I'm going to put a coffee on my head.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.720]   All right, so I guess the iPhone 5 came out this week.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.920]   What?
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   Did you get yours?
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.160]   Probably should have covered that.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Should we have a couple here?
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   Now, I thought it was kind of interesting,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.280]   because the Verge did not get a review unit.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.200]   Did Gadget get a review unit?
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.320]   No, but we tend to aggregate the reviews from everybody else.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.760]   And so--
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.680]   So you didn't need a review unit?
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.760]   We didn't really need the review unit.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.000]   We went through and had our team pulling in.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.040]   I think we have about 19, 20 different sites
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.120]   that we've pulled into these from.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.680]   Yeah, so it's kind of--
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.200]   I can create the Metasquare.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.440]   That's actually what I want anyway.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.360]   I like that.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.640]   But Macworld did--
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.560]   I didn't get one either.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.800]   I got one Friday morning.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.560]   What's odd-- and me too.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.320]   What's odd is, of course, the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.480]   Walt Mossberg's going to get one.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.560]   David Pogge's going to get one.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.320]   John Gruber got one.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.000]   MG Seeker got one.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.080]   The kind of bloggers--
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.360]   and I have to say, excuse me, but the impression I got
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.400]   was the friendly bloggers seemed to get some--
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.280]   in fact, I was told--
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.560]   Anionako told me that Gruber was very visibly at the demo,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   brought into the middle to be given his phone.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.400]   And I think that that's a little message from Apple.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.560]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.720]   Macworld magazine, dude!
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   I've given up on trying to understand
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.200]   why Apple does what it does.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.560]   And I don't feel entitled.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.440]   It was nice.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.280]   I got--
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.440]   I don't feel entitled either.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.600]   I don't know if I'm on fire.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.040]   I'm happy when I get advanced access.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.520]   And if I don't, then I'm just going to go ahead.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.280]   I'm writing-- my review is open on my laptop right now.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.880]   I'm halfway through it.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.400]   It is.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:12.600]   So, yeah.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.120]   You're going to write it while you do the show?
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   It's possible.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.920]   Are you on deadline?
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.200]   It depends on how the show goes.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.920]   So you and I both brought show and tell in.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.120]   But what I brought, which I thought
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.920]   would be kind of an interesting thing to do,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   is to show the original iPhone.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.520]   Now, there's no question in 2007, when this came out,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.680]   this was the Jesus Fund.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's what we called it.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And there was nothing like it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.480]   Right.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.720]   I know it's a little sacrilegious.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.040]   But it was the phone, right?
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.640]   Rim Blackberry, no.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.120]   Totally.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.080]   Phones at that time did not look like this.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.840]   And now they do?
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.680]   Well, that's what's interesting.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.360]   Because, and by the way, I also brought, unfortunately,
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.640]   I don't have the charger for it.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.760]   But this is the first Google phone, first Android phone.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.400]   G1.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.640]   G1 from HTC, which came out a couple--
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.800]   about a year later, I think, 2008.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.400]   I think it was about the fall of 2008 that it first came out.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.360]   And this--
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.840]   I wish I could turn it on because piece of junk.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.240]   Slow, unusable.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.440]   Just not--
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.720]   I actually kind of liked it at the time.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.040]   Did you?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.120]   Yeah, I used it.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.880]   Oh, it's interesting.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   It's got the slider keyboard because that was a big deal
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.560]   to differentiate it from the iPhone.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.680]   It's got a physical keyboard.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.440]   Well, it's also that this phone was in pre-production
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.480]   for a really long time because Google wanted to get everything
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.600]   really sorted with Android before they put the first phone out.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   And so right off the bat, I mean, from when I talked to HTC
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.240]   and Google, they said the future phones are going
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   to be much better than this.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.960]   They knew.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.720]   And in fact, they got better very fast.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.120]   They had to lock the hardware down much earlier
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.240]   than normally would.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.520]   And I think the hardware was locked down a year before release.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.440]   So that is unusual.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.080]   It is unusual.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.120]   It was just because it was the first Android phone.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.720]   And Android got better very fast.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.640]   But what's interesting-- why don't you give me--
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.480]   can I have your S3?
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.240]   Because we could do with this kind of comparison.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.040]   So this is the--
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.800]   First phone sandwich.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   Compared to the latest--
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.240]   many agree the best Google phone, the S3.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.080]   This is the first iPhone compared to the latest iPhone 5.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.680]   And I have to admit--
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.400]   oh, there's my Google authenticator.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.360]   I have to--
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.040]   Sorry, it's useless.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.520]   You're gone.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.360]   And now it's useless.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.080]   30 seconds later, it's something else.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   I have to admit, these two look a lot more alike
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.320]   than the first Google phone and the top of the line Google
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.760]   phone.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.360]   And now, compare the S3 to the iPhone 5.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.720]   Is it OK if I open this up?
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.840]   I don't want to show any of this.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.400]   There we go.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.960]   Hot bigger screen.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.240]   Even this tall iPhone 5 screen is shorter than the screen.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.800]   And it's a lot narrower of the Galaxy S3.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.560]   I'm not sure what this comparison is showing us,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.760]   except that perhaps Apple has not evolved very rapidly.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.960]   Well, Apple's about dropping a big product
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.560]   and then iterating on it year by year.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.920]   And Apple only makes one phone.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.800]   They make the iPhone.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.240]   And they make a new one every year.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.040]   This is the fifth one.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.520]   This is like the 500th Android.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.000]   And Samsung makes more than one Android phone.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.200]   They make a bunch.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.920]   And so there is variety from other manufacturers.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.800]   And Apple isn't playing that game, at least not yet.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.400]   They're taking one shot that they think
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.440]   will appeal to the broadest audience.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.320]   And they also want the iPhone to be
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.040]   recognizably an iPhone.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.280]   But they're playing a different game almost.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.240]   Well, but I think that each DC and Samsung
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.280]   are changing their--
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.560]   Far along in the iPhone thing, it's making it--
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.120]   this is the iPhone 5, but it's really more
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.320]   like the iPhone 10 or something.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.000]   So it's getting increasingly underwhelming, I think,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.960]   to get in the iPhone.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.360]   It's only the 6.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.320]   Because the laws of physics mean that there's only so much
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.160]   better you can make it.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.640]   It still ultimately is a rectangular touchscreen so far.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.440]   And when you upgrade, it still is an iPhone, which
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.880]   is kind of nice because you know exactly what you're doing.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.160]   But it's also, if you have kind of the gadget fever,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.680]   it's a little bit like, oh, it's kind of still an iPhone.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.480]   I mean, that's--
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.240]   I started taking photos.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.000]   So which is interesting--
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.920]   That's the game they're playing.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.160]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.040]   I think Apple does that intentionally, but I think you're right.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.200]   Well, I think there's just a reality
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.480]   that the smartphone market-- I mean,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.960]   we're now many years into the market, five years
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.680]   into the iPhone.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.800]   And we're now-- the first smartphones really
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.960]   hit over a decade ago when you look back.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.720]   And Nokia's.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.600]   The Nokia's and the Prios and things like that.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.160]   And I think that we're reaching a place where the market is--
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.320]   I don't want to say it's mature, but we
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.960]   are at 50% penetration of the market in the US.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.440]   And a lot of the early hurdles and innovations
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.160]   have happened already.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.560]   We've gotten over some of those hurdles.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.520]   And I think the idea that we're going
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.840]   to have dramatic transformation of what smartphones look like
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.160]   or do is not necessarily realistic.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.960]   I mean, it's kind of like where we were 20 years ago with PCs,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.680]   where once we got into the form factors and got to windows
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.000]   and everything, there wasn't necessarily
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.760]   dramatic changes that were going to happen.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.320]   Here's my other takeaway from this-- that the iPhone, when
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.280]   it first came out, was singular, one and only.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.960]   This is now one of many phone choices.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.280]   And I think the good news for users
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.880]   is we have very credible choices on every carrier,
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.040]   not only from Apple and Samsung, but from a bunch
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.000]   of other companies, the new HTC--
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.600]   And here comes Windows Phone.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.400]   Yeah, we're talking about the 8X and the 8X.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.360]   The 8X is a pretty sweet phone.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.160]   It is in terms of the hardware.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.000]   Just talking about the hardware in terms of design.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   That's the problem.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.720]   And well, we can talk about Windows Phone in a sec.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.520]   But I think if you just talk about the hardware
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.960]   and the design and the thoughtfulness that's
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.240]   went into the 8X, I mean, they are getting to, I would say,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.640]   Apple-esque levels of quality fit and finish,
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.480]   thoughtfulness of the design, and the qualities
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.640]   that they're trying to imbue into the device
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.280]   to make it a delightful experience.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.960]   I think that setting aside how you feel about Windows Phone,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.240]   just that the HTC is actually producing some of the best
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.560]   phone hardware around.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.200]   I thought that Lumia 920 was going
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.560]   to be the Windows 8 phone I wanted.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.960]   And I've been convinced by--
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.280]   I would go for the 8X.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.480]   Yeah, Paul Therat and Mary Jo Foley agree.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.440]   Yeah, looks much better than that.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.400]   This is the phone.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.000]   Now, nobody really has played with it yet,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.560]   because Microsoft's not letting--
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.720]   Were you able to touch icons?
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.920]   I've played with the 8X, yeah.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.520]   You have.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.040]   All right.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.320]   So somebody has.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.720]   Mary Jo Foley was not allowed to hold it,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.080]   but not to actually touch an icon.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.120]   Yeah, no, I had access to other ways.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.160]   One of the things Mike would have thought
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.760]   as told its manufacturers is we're
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.960]   not ready to show all the features of Windows Phone 8
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.520]   yet, so they haven't released an SDK,
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.240]   which is a problem, I think, but we can get to that later.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.360]   And they haven't really let people really play with it.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.440]   But good, I'm glad you did.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.640]   So tell us about it.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.680]   I mean, the screen is amazing.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.960]   I wasn't able to spend that much time with Windows Phone 8
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.240]   to really get into a lot of the new stuff that's available to it.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.080]   But the hardware you like.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.720]   Hardware is great.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.640]   I mean, the camera is really nice on the 8X.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.000]   This may be the best camera, better than the Lumia.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.560]   Definitely better than the Lumia.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.040]   And the phone itself is thinner.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.400]   And the screen just really pops.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.360]   And the other thing is they're offering these really bright
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.000]   color--
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.800]   I mean, I could carry lime green, fire engine green,
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.280]   it looks like.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.880]   I mean, I couldn't carry that, but--
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.400]   Do you?
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.440]   Really?
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.920]   I do.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.480]   I love the yellow.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.520]   I love the lime green phone.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.680]   I mean, I think Windows has such a hill to climb
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.040]   in terms of marketing and getting attention.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.240]   That frankly, it's not a bad idea to pull out every single stop,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.800]   including lime green phones.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.240]   Because there's no reason that these phones can't
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.480]   be serious competitors to Android, serious competitors
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.400]   to the-- I would say that Windows 8 phones, to me,
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.040]   are the one-to-one competition for iPhone
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.760]   in terms of market segment, in terms of people who want
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.480]   sort of a simple experience that is consistent, that crosses
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.920]   devices.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.600]   It's just that Microsoft has to make that sell for people.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   But here's the problem.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.440]   Microsoft has to do a much better job marketing.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.800]   And apps.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.680]   Apps, the apps are not there.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.960]   They haven't released an SDK developers,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.520]   unless you're one of the handful who
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   are close partners with Microsoft,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.320]   can't even yet write software for this thing.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.200]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.360]   That's a problem.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.520]   It's coming out in two months.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.560]   Yeah, it's getting better.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.560]   But I think that Microsoft is--
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.640]   I mean, the biggest challenge that they have
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.320]   is that they need to go back two years in time, right?
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.360]   I mean, they just wasted too much time with Windows Mobile,
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.640]   and they pulled the trigger to do Windows Phone just way
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.880]   later than they needed to.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.160]   And whether or not that's a deficit
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.000]   that they can overcome by improving Windows Phone
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.280]   and having great hardware partners is an open question.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.480]   It may be it's possible that there's nothing they can do
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.280]   to make up that time.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.920]   It reminds me of the 49ers Vikings
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.280]   towards the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.520]   They were down a couple of touchdowns.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   You got to start to go for it.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.360]   Don't punt.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.880]   At some point, you can't punt.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.640]   You can't punt anymore.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   You got to just go for it.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.000]   You go for the yellow phone.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.480]   I mean, I think Molly's right that they're
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.800]   trying to reach a segment very similar to Apple.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.400]   Don't make a phone that fulfills all the same needs
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.160]   that Apple fulfills.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.200]   Make all the phones that Apple will never make
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   because they're only going to make one, right?
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.520]   And that means colors and big screens.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.000]   And do anything you can to not be an iPhone.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.840]   On the iPhone, as long as it's black or white.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.720]   Although, it's pretty.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.320]   Look, this is made like a Swiss watch.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.560]   It feels good to me.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.280]   That black phone, I had no idea.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.960]   I only ever used the white one in the demo room at the event.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.400]   And the black one with the--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.640]   because the metal ring around it, it doesn't look like the 4S.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.120]   It's got the black metal ring.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.400]   Everything about it is how much blacker could it be.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.600]   It's like the spinal tap phone.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.520]   None more black.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.920]   Was it you who said it's the 2001 monoliths?
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.920]   I mean, that's going around.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.600]   It's also-- I mean, it's Darth Vader's phone, basically.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.200]   Actually, I'm glad I got the black
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.240]   because I got it sight unseen and I like it.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.040]   Some people have been saying that this paint is scratching.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.080]   I took 8 Exacto knife and scored it, did not scratch.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.200]   So this isn't paint.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.720]   This is an an--
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.600]   I've been getting a lot here in a lot of complaints.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.160]   And I've been hearing people that--
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.680]   It's true.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.120]   Their phone is nicked or scuffed when they take it out of the box.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.920]   Well, bring it back if it's nicked or scuffed when you--
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.600]   But it's happening.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.280]   But I'm saying I'm getting hearing from more people
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.600]   than you would expect that it's a problem.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.400]   Well, it's funny because Apple made a big deal
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.080]   at the announcement about how they take a picture of the back
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.560]   and then match it with a very precisely matched--
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.720]   I mean, they want it to come across
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.440]   as if this is made like a Swiss watch.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.320]   It sounds like the Bevel--
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.960]   But they are making 8 million in two months or something.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.440]   Sure.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.600]   But it sounds like the Bevel that chamf for whatever it is
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.520]   is the place where a lot of the scuffing is happening,
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.120]   which is where the--
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.600]   That may be painted.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.560]   --the little Bevel on the edge is possible.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.600]   Is it gets painted?
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.200]   But you can't have it both ways, right?
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.520]   It's like Apple, you can't tout your quality control
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.680]   and your fit finish and--
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.200]   And then--
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.040]   And then it doesn't happen.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.160]   And then you say, well, you know what, things happen.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.960]   We are going to-- I will say tomorrow is when I start
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.760]   torture testing the microphone.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.600]   Molly, you've got the microphone.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.920]   You now look like you're a board.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.720]   I can't even--
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.160]   --and there's no good place to put it in.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.120]   I'm going to go stop.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.640]   I hate it.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.720]   Yeah, we can hear your eye now.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.320]   My eye is making a weird noise.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.120]   Oh, I hear a touch it.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   I hate them.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.360]   And then the chat room is like, wow, I'm on set.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:49.880]   You sound fine now.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.800]   I don't even hear, or I'm just going to take it off.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.000]   You sound fine now.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.080]   OK, thanks.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.880]   I look hilarious, but at least I sound good.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.280]   No, you always look great.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.800]   You're gorgeous.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   So we're going to start.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.680]   And one of the things that I am going to make sure that I do
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.800]   is try to drag it along the ground.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.880]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.440]   So that we can see if we get that scratching in the back.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.760]   Molly's famous for the tortured tests.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   I fix it to the scratch test, and they manage to scratch it up.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.440]   Everything except for the lens cover,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.080]   which is that Sapphire crystal thing.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.960]   It doesn't scratch, but everything else will scratch to help.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.200]   Of course it will.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.600]   Because it's not made of magic.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.280]   At a mantium.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.120]   At a mantium.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.600]   It's like, come on, of course you're going to scratch it.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.120]   The funny thing about that is if they just made it out of plastic,
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.960]   it would be more durable.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.440]   Like, I mean, I went to town on the Samsung Galaxy S3
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.840]   and could not put a dent in that thing.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.320]   And part of the reason is because it's a little cheapy plastic.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.680]   And then this comes out, you know, and it feels--
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.160]   It almost feels cheap compared to the iPhone 4S,
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.320]   which felt like a heavy premium piece of water house crystal.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.800]   Really?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.640]   No, I agree with that.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.480]   This thing is so sort of lightweight that I was like, how I feel a little tanky.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.040]   I've heard people say that.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.400]   This was glass on the back of the 4S, and this is metal.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.280]   I like that-- I mean, maybe it's a-- I don't know.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.040]   Maybe it's a guy thing, but I actually--
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.800]   I feel like this is like the Porsche design version of the phone.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.120]   I like it better than the old one.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.720]   I didn't expect them to be able to--
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.680]   Molly's point about the laws of physics earlier.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.720]   I didn't expect Apple to really reduce the size and really--
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.840]   the thickness and the weight as much as they did.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.240]   I figured they were reaching the limits.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.640]   Let me see the S3.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   I thought they were--
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.640]   That's a nice--
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   It's pretty light racing.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.040]   It's not much thinner or lighter than the S3.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.240]   I mean, let's face it.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's in the ballpark.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.280]   This is what phones are going to be like.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.400]   Apple does claim the thinnest phone.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   I don't know if it actually is.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.440]   I don't think it is.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.040]   I think there are thinner phones right there.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.760]   But what it is, according to a non-tech and PC magazine,
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.480]   by a long shot is the fastest phone out there.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.800]   Now, I don't know if you'd noticed that, to be honest.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.400]   I don't feel like my quad core S3 is slower.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.760]   But in benchmarks, it absolutely slots slower.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.960]   I think you'll notice the jump to LTE more than some
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.720]   of the other states.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.960]   That I know.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.640]   And that's huge.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.480]   LTE, if you're in a Verizon or AT&T or amazingly enough,
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.840]   a Sprint LTE area, you'll see a big difference in performance.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.320]   No, it is.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.040]   But they had to do that.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.000]   Every other phone's LTE.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.080]   Well, yeah, they had to raise the bar.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.840]   And that's one reason why they had to make the phone bigger
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.240]   is to fit a bigger battery.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.720]   Battery life's decent, right?
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.400]   Although it's about the same--
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.800]   It's about the same as the old one,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.680]   but the old one didn't do LTE.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.360]   So we don't take a hit, in other words.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And they did manage to make it whatever 20% lighter
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.840]   despite the enhanced battery, which
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.760]   means all the other components got lighter, and the glass
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.320]   got thinner and lighter.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.120]   That's a didn't do the iPad thing.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.560]   I'm not noticing enhanced battery.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.440]   That was the one thing where I would have definitely
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.320]   accepted a heavier phone.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.760]   That to me was a big surprise that they didn't somehow
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.920]   double down on battery, because they've
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.080]   done such a good job of battery life with the iPad,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.360]   with the MacBook Air.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.440]   There are so many products in their lineup
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.160]   that have phenomenal battery life.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.320]   I was kind of surprised to see that they didn't make
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.040]   that a big part of their technical development,
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   because that to me, as a consumer, that's a huge jump.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.800]   If you double down on technology around battery life,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.080]   all of a sudden, you are definitely speaking my language.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.200]   I don't think they can.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.400]   Are you hearing about any technologies?
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.680]   Battery technology's still stuck.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.840]   Well, you can make them bigger, right?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.640]   I mean, Apple could have chosen to make this phone
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.040]   the same way as the four.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.120]   And they would have gotten more battery life out of it.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.440]   But Apple seems to have this profile of the amount
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.840]   of battery life that they want, which is about eight hours.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.920]   And that seems to be what they're shooting for for a phone.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.960]   And they'd rather trade off more battery life for a wait.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   You know, I have them reviewing a Razer Max HD, which
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.880]   is the new Droid.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.560]   And it--
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.200]   Two Xs.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.720]   It goes a long way.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.920]   But it's a smaller phone.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.000]   It's a heavier phone.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.280]   But if you want battery life, that thing goes four or five
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.320]   days on standby.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.840]   I have pictures.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.240]   I can prove it.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.760]   So you can get better battery life.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.000]   I think that you're right in a phone
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.080]   where you can't replace the battery that becomes an issue.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.560]   I don't care.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:52.960]   I asked three.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.160]   I just have three batteries.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.760]   And I could just swap--
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.440]   You're going to pop off that case and swap it out.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.480]   So easy to do.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.600]   And it actually has a pretty large battery, all things.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.400]   It's got a very good battery life anyway.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.080]   I've been pretty happy.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.640]   And with CM10, I've been pretty impressed.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.000]   Now, see, I have to do that.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.920]   Because the jelly bean has not come for the--
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.400]   It's supposed to be soon.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.560]   It's been soon for a month.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.120]   But you still have to deal with touch whiz.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.160]   Whereas with CM10, you can get closer to a stock Android
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.680]   experience with--
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.160]   So you rooted your S3.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.320]   And which S3 do you have?
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.560]   I have the AT&T one.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.920]   And so it was easy to root in.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.800]   It was pretty easy.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.880]   It was pretty easy.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.280]   I lost LTE.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.160]   I don't think it's--
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.200]   That's the problem.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.680]   I know.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.640]   There's always one thing.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.200]   But that will probably come at some point.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.040]   There's always one thing that goes away.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.080]   It does actually improve the battery life.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   I'm sure.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.680]   But I was feeling totally underwhelmed by iPhone 5
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.200]   until I started using LTE.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.280]   And then I was like, oh, snap.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.000]   I mean, this is perfect.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   That's the winner for--
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.960]   So my take, I'd love to hear what you think.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.680]   But what I've been saying, what I said on the radio show
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.200]   today is if you have a 4S, I don't think the larger screen
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.320]   is enough to reason to spend a lot of money out
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.880]   of contract money to upgrade.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.640]   But if you're in an LTE area, you might consider it.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.840]   If you have an older phone, it's probably worth the upgrade.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   But this screen is only one icon row, 176 pixels higher.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.680]   It's not--
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.560]   No, I mean, I'm not sure Apple has ever
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.040]   made an iPhone upgrade that was worth upgrading
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.560]   from last year's model.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.440]   That's always their goal is two years.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.920]   I think it's more like two years because the contract,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.600]   in most places, is going to be two years.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.520]   Maybe the retina--
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.440]   I feel like a 4S is a--
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   I was going to say, yes.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.720]   The 3GS to 4, I thought it was a--
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.160]   That was a big jump.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.120]   They've done that.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.240]   But a lot of it is incremental.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.160]   And then after two years, you've kind of collected enough.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.360]   So if I had a friend with a 4S, I
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.000]   would probably say unless they desperately need LTE.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.040]   So you agree?
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:39.840]   That's about what I said.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.040]   But with a 4, I think it's a lot easier to make that call.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.280]   Yeah, if it's 200 bucks, that's worth it.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.480]   Yeah, I would say so.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.360]   And the other question is Android, Windows Phone or iPhone?
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.320]   Is there a best--
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.280]   I don't think there is a more--
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.040]   There's not a best.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.160]   It really depends-- it comes down to what works for you.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.280]   And I'm someone who actually really likes
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.120]   to use lots of different platforms in my life.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.480]   You too.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.800]   And so I'll have an iPad with a carrying Android phone.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.840]   And I still use the ZoomHD sometimes,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.280]   just because it's such a great little music device.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.840]   Actually, Apple has a new ZoomHD.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.480]   They call it the iPod Nano.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.280]   You might like it.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.600]   Then I have to use iTunes.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.880]   And then I'm trying to keep as much iTunes out of my life
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.240]   as a boss.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.440]   The ZoomHD had a great screen.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.800]   A great screen is a really nice device.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.520]   I still have my ZoomHD.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   All right, well, we're going to talk about some
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.240]   of the controversies, including the Maps controversy.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.520]   I don't know if it's ginned up or not.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.560]   But our panel will tell me.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.720]   And there's other news-- believe it or not--
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.920]   there's other news as well, lots to talk about.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.360]   Including the fact, I'll throw this in.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.280]   Apparently, this Verizon iPhone 5, the SIM card's unlocked.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.480]   And I could put an AT&T SIM card in it.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.440]   If I wanted.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.320]   You won't get LTE, but--
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:52.840]   No.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.160]   But if I go to Europe, this makes this--
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.040]   in my opinion, this might be the choice for a traveler.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.840]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.760]   Because you get Verizon LTE.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   And it's unlocked.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.260]   It's unlocked.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.720]   As long as you can get a nano SIM or cut a micro SIM.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:05.720]   That's--
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   --a micro SIM.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.640]   I actually think you cannot cut a micro SIM down,
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   which is going to be a bummer.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.160]   But I think--
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.520]   Yeah, you can.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   Yeah, you can.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.020]   Really?
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.000]   Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.080]   I've seen both.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.840]   That way, Bellie.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.920]   I've seen people cut down the micro SIM to the nano SIM.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.480]   One wrong move.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.720]   You got to be really careful.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.160]   I use scissors to cut a regular SIM down
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.960]   on a micro SIM.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.160]   It didn't work.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   But they make cutters.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.880]   I bought a cutter.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.240]   But I did it with an exacto knife once.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   And I got to work.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:31.520]   I got to work.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.880]   I had a million reasons and $100 a month worth of reasons
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.400]   to stay with Verizon because 18 did doesn't work where I live.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:38.880]   Right.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.760]   But the world phone factor was huge with me for this iPhone.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.480]   I think that's really good news.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.680]   It makes me feel good about switching from AT&T,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.640]   which is what I did.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:53.800]   Here it is, a nano SIM card cutter just for the iPhone 5.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.480]   So maybe you want to bring this with you.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.920]   It looks like they're cutting off some of the metal.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.560]   That's not-- that can't be good.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.360]   That can't be good.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   You don't need this part.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.200]   They just put it in that was just extra.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.680]   Apparently so.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.800]   You don't need that part.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.120]   That's going to throw you off.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.960]   It's cut that.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.840]   To make you not want to cut through it.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   See, Molly, this is why there's some discussion.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.320]   You actually cut into the metal.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:15.960]   Exactly why.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.680]   Like the part that looks like the circuitry also gets cut.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.040]   It's just a flush wound.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   Next.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.240]   Oh, apparently there is 15% thickness difference, too.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.440]   So you have to shave it.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.360]   You got a razor?
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.120]   Presumably in the next six months or year,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   the nano SIM will be around and you'll get one in Europe.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:35.880]   I was going to say, I don't think--
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.360]   I think nano sims are already in use in Europe, right?
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.600]   I don't think anybody's going to make it very difficult to trade.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.840]   I mean, every-- I went to the T-Mobile store
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.560]   to cut down a sim for the S3.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.160]   And nobody makes a big deal out of it.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.120]   So I don't think it's going to be that difficult.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.960]   I would say maybe let's--
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.840]   Remember, the note you fought this tooth and nail.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.240]   They did not want nano sims.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.000]   But they lost--
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.440]   Well, they wanted a different standard.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.160]   A different nano SIM.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.320]   A nano SIM.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.440]   We're going to take a brand-- a nano nano SIM.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.520]   Come back.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.040]   Molly, what is here from Always On?
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.480]   So nice to see you again.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.560]   Yay, Molly.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   We missed you.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.360]   Peter Rojas from Gadget missed you, too.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.480]   But he's been here a lot of time.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.080]   I thought you had never been here before.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.000]   He's been here three times.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.280]   Doesn't him.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.800]   I think my third time, yeah.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.840]   I don't know what's wrong with me.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.480]   I'm an old man.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.960]   I forget Alzheimer's is great, though,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.560]   because everything is fresh and new.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.600]   I've never been on the big show.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.280]   And you are?
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.440]   I've never been on the big show.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.040]   No?
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.160]   Yeah, I'm only on during the week for Mac break week, lately.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Which is now on.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.000]   I love Mac break week.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.160]   No, but now that your IDG's editorial director,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.840]   you do tech hot--
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   Not just the Mac guy anymore.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Not just the Mac guy.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.320]   I'm in the big leagues now.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:36.880]   PC world.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.360]   I mean, you're in the bigs.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.560]   Yeah, you're working with Windows now.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.360]   We could have you on this show.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.720]   You're OK.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.040]   Well, I'm more in just a moment.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.080]   But first, a word from Citrix.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.200]   If you're in business, you know that it's very hard
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.960]   to have face-to-face meetings with everybody
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.640]   you work with, everybody's out traveling,
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.480]   they're out going out places.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:01.680]   Or vacation time, this is why I love go to meeting with HD faces
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.240]   from Citrix.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.400]   Meeting is believing.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.000]   I talked about last week, I talked
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.960]   about this amazing Cornell University study where they actually
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.680]   were able to find four traits that people use to trust other people.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.480]   And they did it over.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.880]   I am, and they did it in person.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.160]   And it did not work unless you saw the person.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.920]   You cannot judge whether to trust somebody according to this study
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.800]   unless you can see them.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.960]   It was like leaning forward versus leaning back,
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.640]   arms folded versus open.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.160]   There were four traits.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.800]   They even did it with robots, and it worked.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.280]   So it's this physical movement that people use to trust somebody else.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.640]   It was a very interesting study.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.920]   New York Times wrote it up a couple of weeks ago if you are interested.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.880]   But it proves my point that when you're meeting with a client, especially--
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.640]   and you want to develop a relationship with them, a perspective client--
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.200]   for them to see you and for you to see them really is a big part of that meeting.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.680]   That's why people want to meet face to face.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.040]   It's just not always easy.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.560]   Go to meeting makes that possible with their new HD faces.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.400]   It's really fantastic.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.000]   It's crystal clear video that you can start a meeting from a Mac or a PC.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.200]   But they can join a meeting from their iPad using the iPad camera, which
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.680]   is super cool, and the mic, and the built-in headphones.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.520]   So literally, you can join a meeting on an iPad anywhere you are.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.760]   Very easy to use.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   You also get free teleconferencing if you choose to use it.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.480]   I love GoToMe.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.400]   I want you to try it free.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.800]   $49 a month when you buy it for as many meetings as you want as long as you want.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:41.080]   Compare that to the big teleconferencing room that the company's built for tens of thousands
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.560]   of dollars.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.960]   This is better.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.520]   Try it free.

[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.920]   So we've got a great panel.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.760]   We're not going to just talk about the iPhone, but it is a big story.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.880]   It only happens once a year, right?
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.920]   It only happens once a year, folks.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.840]   It's like Christmas.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:14.760]   Or Columbus Day.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.120]   Or Columbus Day.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.600]   Or Apple.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   They sold like crazy.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.320]   And one of the issues Apple had is their quarter ends at the end of this month.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.360]   They only had a few weeks.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.680]   And the iPhone 5 was not likely to impact the quarter unless they sold a lot.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.280]   Somebody wrote, and I don't remember who it is, that the real story of the success of
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.640]   iPhone 5 is not how many they sold in the US, but that they were able to get it into
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.240]   30 countries before the end of the quarter.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.120]   That's a testament to Tim Cook, to the operations.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.480]   The supply chain guy.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.440]   And that's the kind of stuff that doesn't make great headlines in the newspapers of the
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.160]   blogs, but really does make a difference.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   It's from Reuters.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.440]   We all get excited about the products, right?
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.120]   And business reporters are more excited about this other stuff, but it is a secret to Apple's
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.880]   success and why they can price the phones the way they do in all their products is the
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:10.320]   supply chain, the volumes of parts that they buy, and expanding this international rollout.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.640]   Because when you look at the iPhone's growth curve over the last few years, there's so
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   much of it happening internationally.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.560]   Outside the US, the iPhone is still growing tremendously fast, especially in places like
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.560]   China.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.800]   So it's a big deal for them to get this rollout.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.880]   I mean, the first iPhone in her two, the rollout was really slow, and now it's pretty
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   huge.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.480]   I remember giving Amber MacArthur a gel broken and hacked iPhone a year after it came out,
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.600]   because she still couldn't get one in Canada.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.360]   Now they're by next Friday, 31 countries, by the end of the year, 100 countries.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.600]   That's more 30 more than the iPhone 4S.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.680]   There are 240 carriers.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.280]   More carriers now than before too.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.720]   Well, and it's not just an accomplishment.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.920]   It's a requirement for Apple.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.000]   I mean, it's something that they have needed to do.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.800]   They've needed to, the fact that they have improved fulfillment overall over the last
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:08.080]   decade is fantastic for consumers, but it also, an international rollout at this point
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:14.120]   in the market share game is crucial for them, because they are the minority to Android.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.000]   Android has a global, a much bigger global base.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.040]   And so being global for the iPhone is really the only thing that will keep it competitive
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.440]   against Android over time.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:27.960]   One of the things I compare it with is the Amazon, the Kindle Fire HD rollout, which
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   was basically US only.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.080]   And while that's great, and I think what somebody said is, well, Amazon doesn't care
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   because really the fire is designed only for people who use Amazon a lot.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   That's who the market is for them.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.880]   I mean, it's designed to tie into their ecosystem of services and if they don't, if they can't
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.080]   offer those services and they don't want you to buy it.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   And there's no point.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.720]   And yet that's what makes the Nexus 7, for instance, the Google 7-inch tablet so much
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   more important than the Kindle Fire, because it is international, right?
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.280]   Well, I think that, I mean, it's definitely important to Google, absolutely.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.880]   And I think it's been important for Android.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.920]   I think that Amazon is playing a different game than everybody else.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.040]   It was really interesting to hear Jeff Bezos say, we don't want to make money on the product.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.960]   We want to make money when you use the product.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.760]   Well, the theory that I have is that one of the advantages for them or one of the reasons
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.880]   why they are so aggressive in selling the Kindle Fire so cheaply is not just because
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.600]   they want everyone to buy, you know, Kindle, Amazon tablets, because they recognize it for
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.840]   a lot of people, they're going to have more than one tablet in the house and that maybe
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.720]   the first tablet will be the iPad.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.120]   But the second one will be a Kindle Fire, which is cheaper, more affordable.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.520]   And if you are using what you're going to do is you're going to kind of, when you're
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.240]   going to talk about ebooks and television and music and things like that, you're going
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.960]   to take the lowest common denominator service, the one that works across both of your tablets.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.800]   And so you use the Amazon one.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.160]   You use the Kindle app on the iPad as well as Amazon.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   Exactly.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   And so it's not just about Amazon selling tablets that people consume their services on.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.880]   It's actually about making people more inclined to use Amazon services on other devices as
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   well.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   That makes sense.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.600]   They just released for the iPad and Amazon streaming movie.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   Absolutely.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.080]   And they're going to keep doing stuff like that because they want people to have, it's
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.760]   almost kind of like a loss leader to get people sucked into your ecosystem.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.120]   And if that's how it works, I mean, that's why, you know, at some point, I mean, that's
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.560]   why they're pricing the Kindle ebook reader so aggressively because once you start buying
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.920]   all your ebooks on the Kindle, even if you're going to read them on your iPhone on your iPad
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.920]   also.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.000]   You know, you're not going to buy iBooks because you can't use it on your ebook reader.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I already do that.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   I buy them on Kindle.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Exactly how I am.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.840]   You know, that's the most, the, the most interesting thing in this whole ecosystem discussion
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.600]   over the past few years is that Amazon is, is maybe the only one who is not trying to
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.240]   create a proprietary ecosystem of interlocking devices.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.480]   They are, they are going for that kind of just like Peter said, I'm just going to say
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.920]   it again, but it's like a different way.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.200]   They, they have a more global model.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:56.640]   They have a model that can somehow make sure that they're actually wherever you are, which
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.800]   in the long run might be more effective.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.360]   I don't think consumers want to be locked in.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.040]   I don't think, you know, I think that people do want to mix and match an iPad and an Android
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.920]   phone or an iPhone and an Android tablet and a Samsung TV as opposed to buying everything
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.400]   from Samsung, Apple or Google.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.040]   But I bet you, Molly, you have an iPad and a Kindle e-anch reader.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.040]   I do.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   I do.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   What did you see the all do?
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.640]   The iPad to me is not a reader and never has been the iPad to me.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.880]   I think the evolution of that device is that it is essentially another TV in the household.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.120]   I mean, in my case, I'm not allowed to touch it.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.240]   Only my son gets to touch it.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.240]   So I had to go.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   Is that Eli's rule?
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   Kind of.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.520]   Well, I mean, I could maybe touch the iPad when he's like asleep, but he's just playing
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.520]   with it.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.520]   No, it's mine.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.520]   Yeah, he's like, what are you doing?
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.000]   I need to be watching Ninhjago on YouTube now.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Eli rules.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.320]   That sounds like my son.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   What is it?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   Inhago?
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.320]   Lego Ninhjago.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.240]   It's the world's greatest marketing scam for selling legos.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   I feel so old.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.520]   It's a Lego show.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   Can we have a tangent rant about the people that is Ninhago?
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.520]   What is it?
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   What's going on here?
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   Guys.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520]   NJA, G-O.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   How do you even push?
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   N-I-N-J-A-G-O.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.040]   And it's like Lego was like, we're not selling enough Lego.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.320]   We need to sell even more Lego.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.080]   So let's make a TV show with animated characters who are made out of Lego.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.240]   And then people will watch the show and become obsessed.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   It's not Ninhjago.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   It's Ninhjago.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   No, it's Ninhjago.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   Trust me.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   Trust me.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.640]   I could get my son in here.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   He'll explain it to you.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.040]   No, you see, the reason that's Ninhjago is, okay, so they're fighting and then you buy
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   the Lego set.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.040]   They're made out of Legos.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.320]   And then you can't buy just the little guy.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   No.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.400]   Like you can't just have four of them, the four little ninja.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.240]   You have to buy like a $45 vehicle.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.040]   Yeah, motorcycle.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.000]   You know why this happened, by the way?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.480]   Do you understand what happened?
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.560]   I'm thinking universally available CAD software and 3D printers.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.560]   Down.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:02.120]   No, no, the reason this happened is Lego's copyright on the Lego design expired about
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.440]   a year ago.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.280]   So anybody can make Lego compatibles.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.200]   Now for a long time and they were very aggressive about pursuing people, you could not make
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.440]   a compatible Lego.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.800]   So no, it's all about the intellectual property.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.000]   And Lego saw this coming.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.680]   And if you went to Lego land, as I did with my kids, your kids age, my kids will never
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   be your age.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.840]   No, my God, I hope so.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.840]   Let's hope.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:28.440]   When my kids were your kids age, we went to Lego land and then you could buy bricks,
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.080]   you know, just and build something you wanted.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.400]   Now it's all about kits.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.400]   You can't, it's hard to buy just plain bricks.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.880]   Lego stores, you can buy bricks.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.320]   Yeah, but you have to go to the Lego, make a pilgrimage.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.160]   What they make money on because this is still trademarked is Ninhjago and whatever else
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   licensing deals they've made.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   Very interesting.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.480]   This week in Lego, let's make it, let's do it.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.440]   Well, it's a lesson, you know, you don't want to let that trademark lapse.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.800]   That's why in Disney keeps, you know, moving, copy right now.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.280]   He keeps lobbying the government to extend their, yeah.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   Once Mickey's not.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   How did we get on Lego Ninhjago?
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.760]   I don't know, but it's a good subject.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.040]   How many iPhones did they sell in?
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.280]   If you, if you went online to buy one hour before Apple Store got sold out midnight to
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   1 a.m.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.880]   I got mine on Verizon 8 a.m. but I couldn't get the 64 gig.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.720]   They were short so shortly after.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   How about yesterday?
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.480]   Were the stores in short supply?
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.960]   I talked to, I talked to people who walked right in.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.240]   The line, you know, the lines are great for PR for Apple and that's why they reserve a
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.520]   certain number to put up the stores separate from your preorder.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.280]   And the people who wait in line either don't, either don't know or they just love to be
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.520]   in line or they love to be in line and be interviewed by the press.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   That's what they know.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.200]   But after that line clears, I talked to somebody who walked right in at 1 in the afternoon,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.080]   walked right up and got the phone that they wanted.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.880]   But you, you know, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was waiting in line
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   outside.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   It was all PR.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   It was all people promoting their startups.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   It's such, it's obnoxious.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   And they know channel four, five, six, seven.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.880]   By the way, check out my stuff.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.240]   I feel bad for the guy who paid $1,500 on TaskRabbit to have a guy waiting in line because he could
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.320]   have really just gotten the phone himself five hours later.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.120]   But you got the PR value of being stupid.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.440]   You saw what, you saw what Fox five.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.160]   The value of that ultimately, nobody knows what that guy's app is, right?
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.760]   They just know, like, he's that idiot.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   That's a good thing.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   It's great for TaskRabbit.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   Maybe TaskRabbit.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   Maybe he's a TaskRabbit.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   Paul in the string secretly.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   Mm hmm.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   It's all coming together now.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   They're probably in league with the Ninjago people.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   I got it.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   I got it.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   Next season of Lego Ninjago, they fight the TaskRabbit.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.480]   We're back on Lego Ninjago.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   All right.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   Here is exactly why somebody is first in line in an Apple store.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.320]   This is Fox five, the local news.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.480]   It's my local five days.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.480]   I get, I get, watch this stuff.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   Watch.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   I get press releases from people in line showing I'm in line.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   I love the line.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   It's about the experience.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   It's about the experience.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   It's about the experience.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   There's no doubt that Don, Get Your Rock D of New Jersey is a fasheck man and an iPhone
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   fan.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   I've been on here for a since Thursday.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480]   Why?
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   Because my startup startup is more amazing.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   It's the best Apple product ever.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   Watch though.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   Watch careful.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   Watch the iPhone.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.480]   It's about the time that you've come out until Friday, but already about a dozen people are
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   camped out in front of Apple's New York flagship store on Fifth Avenue starting at 200 bucks.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   The iPhone 5 is sleeker, has a laser keyboard, holographic images and other new features.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   Watch your iPhone.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   That's why I won't be watching Fox five.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   Wow.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   I will say I live in New York and that's actually pretty normal for that channel.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   Apparently the reporter got taken in by a concept video.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   It's been floating around for a while.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   Is that report from like the fringe universe, the alternate universe?
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.480]   I want that iPhone.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   It's in the hole.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   That's the iPhone that happens when we surpass the laws of physics.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   Yes.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   Yes.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.480]   It won't be...
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.480]   It won't be scratchable either.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   That's the good news.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   That would actually be news.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   The moment the line waiters are more of a PR liability than an asset for Apple, Apple will turn it off
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.480]   and say we're not going to let you wait in line or they'll change the...
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   We may have seen the last one.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   It's jumped the shark, don't you think?
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   It's got pretty embarrassing.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   There was some free advertising there other than the fact it was for lasers and holograms.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   How many did they sell based on that?
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   Well, my question is how many...
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   Do you think the first weekend everybody would be watching, they sold...
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   They said what?
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   2 million in the first day on the three orders.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.480]   You think it'll be 4 million, 8 million?
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   It's so hard to tell.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   I've seen some analysts say 6 million.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.480]   It'll be a nice big number and we won't know what it really means for another six months.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   We won't really say this.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   But we'll know what is that October 15th for the quarterly results.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   We'll know when they have make that phone call.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   They'll say how many they sold from now to the end of the month.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   Right.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   And so it looks like success Tim Cook, that's why Apple stock well over 700 bucks, he was able to make this phone affect the quarter in ten days.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   It's a remarkable thing.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   Just remarkable.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   It's remarkable, but it's got to be a little bit scary.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   Because when you have that much of your company at this point riding on the...
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   I mean, they're selling max like gangbusters, don't get me wrong.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   But it's not big part of the profit.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   So much of the success of the company rides on this phone and this ecosystem.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   And I really do think that we are at a point now where the smartphone market is maybe not as mature as it's going to get, but mature enough that consumers have a lot of really good choices.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   I know a lot of people who aren't going to buy an iPhone who are not geeks who are not wanting to upgrade all their accessories, who are interested in Windows Phone because of corporate reasons who think that Android is cheaper.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   I mean, I think it's a slightly scary position to be in when all your eggs are in that one.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   I basket.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   I agree.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   It's like 60% of their revenue.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   Something like that.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.480]   I mean, it's suddenly become a huge percentage of Apple's revenue.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   And I think we recognize that the iPhone is maybe first among equals, but there are many other choices.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   Sure.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   The question is when do real people realize that?
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   I mean, right now this is a fashion statement.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   You buy this because it's cool, right?
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.480]   I don't agree with that.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   I think that...
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.480]   I think so.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   Now, any more?
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   I think remember that.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   Did you see the Samsung commercial, the Galaxy S3 commercial that made fun of the people in London?
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   Yeah, but that Samsung...
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   And with absolutely brilliant stuff.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   Oh, I agree.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   It is totally true that your mom is on iPhone right now.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   Did you notice the pivot though?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   The first Samsung line commercials, the people in line were like Justin Long, Hipster, Dufus'...
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   I'm a Reese.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   And the regular people were outside saying I got a Samsung.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   And now they pivoted and it's Dufus' on the line for the iPhone and the Hipsters have the Samsung.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   It's a really strange change that they've made in that campaign.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.480]   Well, but it's also...
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   I think it's a little bit accurate.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   I mean, I actually do think that there is increasingly cache and having a phone that does something
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   else that's cool, whether it's have a giant screen or up until now have 4G.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   I mean, I do...
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   I think that there's a move away from it and iPhone is becoming the easy option.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   I mean, this goes to what Matt Honan...
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   It's the easy big phone.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   What Matt Honan wrote about it being great and boring, and there's some truth to that,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   is that it's been so successful.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   It is so broadly considered sort of the default smartphone in some ways.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   And then everything else becomes an alternative.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:20.480]   And that's not a bad position to be in on one level, but I think you're right, that it's not the Rebel Alliance
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   or anything like it.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   It's the Death Star.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   To me, the biggest challenge is not necessarily whether it's iPhone versus everybody else,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   but it's really Samsung and Apple kind of carving up the mobile industry for themselves
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   and leaving everybody else out of it.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   That wouldn't be good.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   You do want competition.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   You absolutely want competition.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   I think that what you have is two companies which have mastered the supply chain and realized
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:50.480]   that the scale that you need to have to be successful and competitive in the space is making it
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   really difficult for everybody else to compete.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   HTC is creating great phones, but they just don't have the scale and the supply chain of Samsung
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   and Apple to be able to produce the phones as cheaply.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   And so it really hurts them in terms of profits.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   I think they're the only other mobile phone maker which is profitable right now.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   They're much smaller than Samsung and Apple.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   But for everybody else, the story to me is not, is Apple walking away with it, but it's
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   really, is it going to be Apple and Samsung that walk away?
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   And then what happens to Motorola?
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   What happens to HTC?
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:36.300]   What happens to
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.260]   Or we may see that the smartphone market has reached maturity, and that all of the real growth
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.540]   happens someplace else and the technology industry happens in wearables or happens in some other,
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.240]   you know, part of the industry, and that's where Apple really faces a challenge, it's not...
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:56.100]   ...to someone else start taking away smartphone share from them,
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.060]   but that does all the growth in the technology industry come from some other segment of the market
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.740]   that Apple's not able to compete in.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.740]   Like TVs.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.340]   Like TV or some other... Well, Apple devices are a good example.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.340]   Imagine back when the iPod was the thing, right?
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.540]   I mean, if Apple had just sort of said, "We're just doing the iPod, we're good here,"
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.380]   and hadn't been developing the iPhone or...
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.380]   It's very good, exactly.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.380]   Where would they be?
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.820]   They'd be dominating a segment that's just fading away?
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.860]   Yeah, I mean, you could go back 70 years ago, we were all like, "Well, what will ever
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   displace the iPod?"
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.180]   And it turned out to be smartphones.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.780]   And Apple was smart enough to realize that if they didn't cannibalize themselves that
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.180]   somebody else would.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.220]   And so, the big question is going to be, what is going to end up kind of cannibalizing that
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.220]   share at some point?
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   That's the innovator's dilemma.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.300]   Apple so far has done a good job of transcending it.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.220]   Yeah, and you know, I mean, I'll be honest, I don't really spend a lot of time worrying
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.220]   about Apple.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.220]   No, none of us do.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.220]   None of us do.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.220]   Because it's funny that...
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.220]   Because it's funny that I'm talking about it, but just a lot of times talking about it.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   Yeah, I'm talking about it.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.780]   I think Apple isn't dire in dire straits or any kind of danger.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.860]   Yeah, but it is funny, like, how sometimes you will see, I won't say names, but you do
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.620]   see, like, you know, Apple partisans who are so defensive of the company.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.780]   Like, you know what, it's not 15 years ago when the company was on the verge of bankruptcy
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.780]   and needed to be protected.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.860]   Like, I don't worry about that.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.420]   I know the 1997 thing reminds me of my dad grew up during the Great Depression.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.660]   And it's like the permanent scarring of you never living through that.
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.700]   And with a lot of Apple people, it's like that.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.300]   And the reality is Apple is so profitable.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.540]   If you don't even look at the market share numbers and say there are more Android's phones
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.580]   being sold than iPhones.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:31.180]   If Apple ends up with, what, 30% of the smartphone market is stable, 40% and is doing the profits
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.260]   that they're doing now, they're going to be fine, right?
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.580]   But what is the shape of that overall market is the big question.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.060]   Is it just a couple of phone makers?
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.540]   I mean, it's certainly possible.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:46.100]   The market seems to be coalescing and that, and again, it's such a huge industry that
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.420]   if you're not able to get to massive scale, you're not going to be able to compete.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.180]   And you'll see the Huaweis and ZTEs of the world kind of taking on the low end of the
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.180]   market.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:59.060]   And then Samsung and Apple dominating the high end in Western Europe.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.220]   Should consumers care about that?
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.220]   Does that matter?
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.220]   I'm not sure consumers should really care.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.060]   I mean, they should buy a phone that makes them happy, right?
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.420]   And I think we're getting to a place where most consumers, it's going to be like the
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.420]   PC market where you walk in and you kind of have a sense of what you're going to get.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.060]   And you might not care that much about the specific brand if you're just looking for
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.460]   a set of experiences.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.620]   Or Apple has such a great brand that people feel safe buying it.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.540]   And there's a comfort level that's going to be hard to overcome.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.260]   Ultimately, though, what makes this powerful is it's going to become a platform in the
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.140]   same way that Windows, the PC industry, wouldn't have happened if Microsoft hadn't come along
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.420]   and made a stable platform that people could develop software for.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:42.620]   And all the growth happened subsequent to that with people developing software.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.100]   Maybe we're in that kind of maturity now with these phones where you've got two dominant
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.660]   stable, let's hope platforms, iOS and Android.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.820]   Now, innovation happens in software.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.820]   Is that possible?
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.860]   Certainly, location and mobile are huge.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.860]   Sure.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.820]   Yeah, I think it does remind me a lot about where we got with the PC market in the mid-90s
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.060]   where it was stagnant.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   It was boring.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:09.500]   But the fact that we had a platform that everyone agreed would build on top of with
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.980]   Windows is what really unleashed the PC revolution.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.420]   I mean, that's the long and short of that consistency.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.540]   And I think we may be getting to a similar place like that with phones.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:23.660]   I think to go back to the point that you made about the next platform.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.300]   I mean, I think we are getting to stable platforms.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.940]   I would not count out Windows yet.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:33.100]   I actually do think that they have a chance to be a valuable third platform there.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:37.300]   But I start to wonder if at some point smartphones won't, they will be displaced by something
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.300]   else.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:44.420]   And the chatroom has pointed out that if the innovation starts to happen in software,
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:51.380]   it seems to be around sharing and that as sharing becomes the more important, or rather,
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:55.340]   the thing that people want to do the most with their devices, that wearables and things
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:52:00.460]   like Google Glasses actually do become potentially threatening and smartphones could get dumber.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.460]   That's an interesting problem.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.660]   No, I think we might see an unbundling of the smartphone into a bunch of different devices.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.700]   And so I wrote something the other day that my kind of pet theory that the reason why they
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.740]   changed the design of the Nano was to make it less watch-like.
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.860]   We read that article last week because I thought that was very interesting.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.620]   People thought that Apple had missed a bet that there's this huge market for wearable
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:25.380]   NANOs and they changed a Nano so it's no longer a wristband, but you had a great insight.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.860]   No, Apple doesn't make a mistake like that.
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.860]   They make mistakes, but that's not a mistake that they're-
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.860]   I thought that was brilliant people.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.860]   What were you-
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.860]   So tell people what you said.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:38.260]   Well, so my theory is that the last Nano, was it the sixth generation Nano, I think?
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.260]   I'm looking to you, Jason.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.260]   You should know this call.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.260]   Yeah, it's the fifth or sixth.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.260]   Oh, NANOs.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.260]   Okay, anyway.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.020]   So the last one had this watch like, you know, you could put it in a watch band.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.020]   It was kind of had-
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.940]   There were all these kick-started things to make watch.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.220]   And so, and then is there anybody wearing a Nano watch in the studio audience?
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.660]   But it wasn't even about it being a wearable.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.340]   It was a disconnected wearable.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.340]   It was a little weird.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.340]   No, it doesn't matter.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.340]   But there were a lot of people.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.340]   There were a lot of people that is not connected.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.340]   It has to be an always on device.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.740]   It has to be connected somehow.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.540]   It has to be involved sharing.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.540]   So there's the pebble.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.540]   So that's why the pebble.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.860]   But people thought that this was maybe a direction and then Apple would evolve it and instead
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.860]   they backed away from it.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   They cut the Nano.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.020]   They cut it and said we're going to have the Nano that you clearly cannot wear in your
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.020]   wrist.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:22.060]   And so, and so my theory is that they did that to make room for a wearable device because
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.900]   it would be a little confusing to have the Nano which is kind of something you can wear
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.020]   in your wrist and then this other wearable device.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:32.300]   And I would think that this wearable device wouldn't be necessarily about playing music,
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.780]   more about controlling, you know, your phone or-
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.580]   Notification, a pebble from Apple.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.580]   A pebble from Apple.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.580]   Like a pebble device.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.780]   Each cheaper integrated deeply with the iOS.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:45.420]   Yeah, it's like Bluetooth 4.0 and it would be something that like allowed you to extend
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.500]   that iPhone experience into another device.
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.340]   And if you kind of extrapolate from that, even if Apple doesn't understand what I'm doing,
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.980]   but like you could see us getting to a place where we have this whole network of devices
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.460]   that we carry and maybe we have like a tiny MyFi like device that we carry in our pocket,
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.260]   which is where all the connectivity, the WAN connectivity happens.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.140]   Maybe that's the brain, you know, a little processor, a little processor and then everything
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:10.020]   is distributed out, you know, over Bluetooth, you know, 10.0 or whatever.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.020]   Certainly interest.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.700]   I mean, pebble watch raised $10 million with 68,000 backers.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.500]   And this is a Cluj, you know, arguably Cluj.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:22.500]   If Apple did something that was elegant, trim and looked just like the Swiss railroad
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.020]   clocks, it would be huge.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:29.260]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's even less about the watch as much as it is about the all the
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.940]   like notifications controlling, you know, rejecting calls, the text messages.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.420]   Yeah, I don't think it's not a, it's not a watch thing at all.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.740]   It's much more in the fuel band camp where somewhere.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.740]   Yeah, right.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.580]   It'll have a fitness component to it.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:41.580]   Right.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.220]   I mean, the point is the connectivity, the point is the sharing, the point is the social
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   aspect.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.220]   And then it's from there.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.460]   And I'm excited about this.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.260]   It's just a short hop to implants.
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.260]   Connected implants.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.460]   Are you going to have to?
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.140]   Like I want the Google glasses in my eyeballs.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.540]   I want the connectivity.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.900]   I think I'm going to have a left implant will be Android.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.060]   The right one will be iOS that way.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.460]   I can be agnostic.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.900]   I was surprised that Leo went there.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.900]   And you are?
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.100]   You obviously don't know me well.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.100]   Chat room first.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:13.780]   At Macworld Expo a couple of years ago, the guy who created HyperCard actually did this
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.260]   whole thing about future tech.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.500]   And he talked about, you know, we need to do some miniaturization.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:23.020]   But the idea that you can take something that's got a, you know, like LTE and it's
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:28.540]   got a voice recognition and speech synthesis and some webcams and GPS and you can stick
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.540]   it in your ear.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.940]   So even, you know, Google Glass kind of heads up aside, stick it in your ear.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.700]   It knows where you are, where you're looking.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   It can talk to you.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.700]   You can talk to it.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.740]   You know, we're not that far off from those technologies being around.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.260]   We've got a little personal assistant just in your ear and you ask what to do and you
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.740]   don't even need the touchscreen anymore.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.540]   I mean, we're definitely heading in that direction.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.740]   And I'd be really surprised if Google wasn't also working on something.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.060]   And I find fascinating about the wearable spaces.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.060]   Okay.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.180]   If you take a step back, like what was interesting about tablets is that like everyone who made
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.660]   a smartphone and everyone who made a PC was like, that's my domain, right?
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.660]   I should make a tablet.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.260]   So you had tons of people making tablets.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.260]   It's wearables.
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.220]   It's like you have the universe of company.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.220]   Tommy Hilfiger.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.700]   It's like Nike is like, well, this is really our wheelhouse.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:14.900]   And so you can see like it's you're going to start to see companies in this space that
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.340]   aren't traditionally, you know, in that space.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.940]   And if you think about it, I mean, you know, Apple wasn't really an electronics, you know,
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:26.940]   entertainment electronics company until it did the iPod and then and they sort of like
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.940]   computer company.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:32.220]   And so you could see like, you know, people moving laterally into the space having a
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.220]   huge impact.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.740]   I mean, Nike could end up becoming a technology company.
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.740]   Right.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.740]   More than a machine company.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.740]   They increasingly are.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.500]   I know somebody who works on that fuel band team and they are increasingly becoming app
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.380]   developers and platform builders and, you know, and they're clunky about it, but they're
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.260]   trying to figure out an ecosystem like we all are.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:54.020]   And it's exciting because I hope, I think we all hope, I think even the audience hopes
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:58.060]   that the next time we have this panel, maybe in two years, that we're not only talking
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.260]   about Google and Apple and Amazon.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.260]   That, that, right, let me.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.020]   You know, there is always that it becomes easy to get myopic about the companies that
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.620]   seem to dominate the world right now.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:11.220]   But then we forget that those companies used to be completely different companies, that
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.980]   there is a universe of competition available that it because it won't be smartphones forever.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.980]   It just won't.
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.300]   We talk about and have over the years many different companies.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:24.460]   I don't, it just happens to be that, you know, there is a handful of companies at any
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.780]   given time that are dominant.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.780]   Exactly.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.780]   But that changes all the time.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.780]   I can guarantee you it won't be the same companies in a year.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.820]   It feels like the same ones for, it feels like the past four years it's just been, you
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.620]   know, Google, Apple, Amazon.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.660]   They keep fighting everybody who's interesting too.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.980]   Yeah, but that's a shame.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   Let's take a break.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.180]   I want to talk about maps.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.780]   That's a big brew, haha.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:49.060]   Yes, there's a little bit of Apple still in that I'm sorry to say.
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.860]   But we can talk about Twitter.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:54.700]   We could talk about Iran, which is creating its own internet.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.700]   That's one way to deal with it.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.860]   Let's make your own.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.180]   And we'll leave Google out of this one.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.340]   And the new candy bar that tracks you wherever you go.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.140]   That's all coming up as we continue this week in tech with Molly Wood from Allwayson
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.780]   from gadget.com Peter Rojas.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.940]   Great to have you.
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.740]   What even brings you out to the Bay Area?
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:17.100]   Well, two very, two people very close to me got married yesterday, Ryan and Veronica.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.460]   I heard about that.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.460]   How was that?
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.460]   That was great.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:25.980]   It was a really beautiful ceremony and Tom Merritt officiated.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.740]   And it was great.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.500]   I'm very, very happy for them.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.540]   I'm going to see if I can find there were pictures of...
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.540]   Lockmont is the hashtag.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:39.020]   All you have to do is search Twitter for BLOCKMONT and you find a lot of...
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.020]   Wow.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:47.060]   I'm going to see if I can find a beautiful picture of Veronica in her wedding dress.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.060]   So that went well.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.060]   That's neat.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.060]   Yeah, no, it worked out.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.060]   They're married now.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.060]   Yep, still married?
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.060]   Still going well?
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.060]   Okay.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.060]   They're still married.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.260]   She changed her Facebook status.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.260]   She did?
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.260]   Wow.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.300]   I mean, Tom's wife tweeted a super cute photo of the two of them like changing their status
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.780]   together because there's such big nerds.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.780]   Oh, God, that is so nerdy.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.780]   Yeah, they did it at brunch today.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:09.780]   They're adorable.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.780]   They did it as part of their ceremony.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.180]   No, no, no, that was like, you know, whatever.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.460]   They should have said, "There's a song I got married to when I got married five years
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:21.180]   ago, we actually changed our status on MySpace as part of the song."
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.180]   Wow.
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:23.180]   Or at the reception.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.180]   That is kind of cool.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.180]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.660]   That's the new thing to do, huh?
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.380]   Well, not MySpace, but Facebook.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.540]   Well, hey, next year will it be still the Facebook.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.540]   I really did.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.540]   He has his way.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.540]   Wow.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.540]   What will be the next one, huh?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.220]   Let me see if I'm scrolling through my--
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.540]   I've married 18 years.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.460]   I can't remember logging into CompuServe or--
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.460]   Mm-hmm.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.460]   So this is--
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:44.460]   No, that's--
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.460]   That's-- I don't know what that is.
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.460]   That's what it is.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.460]   That's Ryan.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.460]   That's not from yesterday.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.460]   That's not the way--
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.460]   That doesn't look like it.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.380]   Just do a Twitter search for BlockMiles.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.380]   Wow.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.380]   A technical.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.380]   Do a Twitter search.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   So I'll be--
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.380]   It's not that technical.
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.420]   There's no such thing as a Twitter search.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.420]   Don't you know that?
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.420]   All right.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.420]   #BLOCKMONT.
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   It should be easy enough to--
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.420]   Yeah, the first picture I found was of like the high-tech toy--
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.420]   There she is.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.420]   The reception, though.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   So that sounds so good.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.420]   Oh, doesn't she look beautiful?
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.420]   Eating cake.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.900]   That's-- Tom Merritt took that picture.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.460]   Gorgeous dress.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.020]   That's a little dark.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.020]   There's the reception.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.180]   It was a small wedding.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.700]   Yeah, it was really small.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.420]   There's Ryan and Tom.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.580]   They're looking a little green right now.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.580]   He must be nervous.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.580]   Mm-hmm.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.580]   Aw.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.580]   That's nice.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.580]   All right.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.580]   Anyway, congratulations.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   I'm glad you came out for that.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   That's neat as you move.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]   I got to benefit from it.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.180]   Definitely was not going to miss that.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.180]   Are they going on a geek honeymoon?
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180]   Where are they going?
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.180]   They're going--
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.180]   Pirates of the Caribbean.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.180]   Pirates of the Caribbean.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.180]   They're going to take a few days.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.180]   Good.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.180]   Somewhere.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.020]   We have a board meeting on Thursday so he has to be back for that.
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.020]   Sorry, Ryan.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.740]   But they're going to take a proper trip next year.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.660]   Good.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.660]   That's what they are.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.660]   To my home country of Peru, actually.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.660]   Oh.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   That's your home country?
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.660]   Yeah, I'm a dual citizen.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.660]   I know you're Peruvian.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:58.660]   You have Peruvian.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.660]   Rojas.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.660]   Of course.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.660]   Perus great.
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.660]   I love Peru.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.660]   I was in Machu Picchu this time last year.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.500]   You know, my great uncle built the hotel that's there by the-- by right-- outside the--
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500]   the site.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500]   No kidding.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.500]   Which one?
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   There's one that's right literally without--
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   That's the one we stayed in.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.500]   It's a beautiful hotel.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   Yeah, you can walk right into Machu Picchu.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500]   It's great.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.660]   Boy, if I'd known, I would have-- I would have dropped your name.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.460]   I know you're nephew, you know.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.980]   Anyway, we will continue on with it in the show in just a bit.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.620]   Also, here, the editorial director for IDC.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.580]   And techhive.com, Mr. Jason Snow.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.500]   Mac-- Macworld Magazine, that too.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.500]   Stamps.com.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500]   Can I talk about postage?
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.580]   You know, this is-- what were we talking-- it's like postage on demand.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.860]   We were talking about this the other day.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.700]   Normally with postage, you go to the post office, you buy stamps, you do all your mailing,
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.700]   you come home.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.860]   Would it be nice if-- whenever you need it, you had a stamp.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.380]   And whenever you need a mail something, you were ready to go.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.620]   Stamps.com, it's on demand postage.
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.820]   Because you use your computer and your printer to print postage.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:05.460]   Always the right postage, the postage that you need.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.460]   They have a USB scale.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.340]   In fact, I'm going to tell you how you can get that for free in a second.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:13.420]   That you plug into your computer and then it's just automatically tells you what postage
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.420]   you need.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.660]   You print right on the envelope if you want.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.820]   Not only the postage, but stamps.com will do the whole thing.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:23.220]   The addresses, the return address, your business logo and stamps is very professional looking
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.700]   to print mailing labels.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.460]   And if you're doing international mailing, they'll automatically print out all the forms
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.140]   you need and you get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.180]   If you're an Amazon eBay or Etsy seller, it's great for that.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.500]   It'll take all the information from the website.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.100]   Print out very professional looking mailing labels.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.420]   This is such a great service.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.100]   Saves you money because you get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.980]   It's on demand whenever you need it.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.060]   And by the way, you don't even have to get up to mail it because the mail carrier comes,
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.660]   of course, every day to pick it up and you can even schedule free pickups at your convenience.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   Stamps.com.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.700]   Now, you see it says $110 offer.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.420]   But on the front page, it says 80.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.420]   Watch this magic.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.220]   Brian Brush would be proud.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.260]   You click the microphone on there.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:10.140]   You enter TWIT in the field there and $110 bonus offer.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.180]   $55 in free postage.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.700]   You get a free digital scale.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.420]   It's that USB scale I was mentioning.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.660]   You just pay shipping and handling on that.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.900]   It's about $5 to make that up.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.940]   They give you a $5 supply kit and you get the four week trial.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.780]   All you have to do is use the offer code TWIT.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.260]   Never go to the post office again.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:30.540]   Post office, hot and cold running post office right in your house.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.540]   Stamps.com.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.580]   Give it a try today.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.980]   So a lot of heat.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:41.260]   It's interesting to watch Google spin up the heat on the maps thing.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:45.700]   In fact, there was just an article saying Google spent 400 years doing its maps.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.660]   I don't understand how that could be possible.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.340]   But that was what they said.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.420]   I wasn't sure what they were trying to 400 man years.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.420]   Like in man hours?
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:57.220]   No, but it's more than that, I'm sure.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:01.700]   This is how awesome Google is as they built a time machine or they will build a time machine
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.700]   and then go back in time 400 years and start making a map.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.180]   They say they have a 400 year advantage.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.740]   So good luck, Apple.
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   I don't know how they're doing that.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:19.700]   But it is pretty clear from people who are complaining about the new maps app on iOS 6.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.780]   For those who don't know, I'm sure there's not many of you, Apple replaced the Google
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.540]   maps on iOS 6.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.780]   Which it wrote?
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.780]   The app was written by Apple, but the data source was Google.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.780]   Data was Google.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:36.560]   They replaced that with one that basically they wrote, but the maps or data is now Tom
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.900]   Tom and some other sources.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.300]   Apple massages it, apparently not too much.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.480]   Well, in some areas, right?
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.800]   If you tested in San Francisco.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   Works great, San Francisco.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   Perfect.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.440]   But if you go out into the local and island.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.360]   English countryside, it's not so good.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.280]   So I don't think that's a big deal.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:59.560]   But what it does point up is, you know, there's a lot to making a maps app and it's not going
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:04.640]   to be something that they're going to be able to come out of the box and immediately do
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.920]   a great job with, right?
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.800]   I mean, what is that too much to ask?
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.680]   I think it's reasonable to expect that the maps app would be really good.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.600]   I think it is also a reason.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.520]   Maps is a discipline that has now been well accomplished in the smartphone marketplace
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.520]   and elsewhere.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.840]   And it actually is, I mean, every time I see one of these headlines that says, you know,
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.920]   Apple's response is, well, bear with us, we're learning.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.000]   And I'm thinking, really, what more learning do you have to do?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.880]   From whom do you have to learn?
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.520]   Mapping is everywhere.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.960]   There are tons of blog posts from people who are in the GIS and mapping industry saying,
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.800]   you know, you could have called any of us by all accounts.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.240]   Apple did not reach out to anyone.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:51.960]   They did this in their, in what, when Apple stumbles, it is always for the same reason.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.200]   It's because they built it in a bubble, in a crazy little Apple hubris bubble.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.480]   And they didn't talk to anybody.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.560]   And they didn't use the solution on the market.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.560]   It's the same reason Siri sucks because it's not Google.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.200]   TomTom was, which provided much of the data was quick to point out that they don't have
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   the same problem.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   Their TomTom app is fine.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   Thank you very much.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   It's not our fault.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.120]   It's our own Apple under the bus.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.160]   Well, Apple kind of, I mean, people were throwing that TomTom under the bus.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.800]   So I guess it's a defensive measure.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.880]   Well, the thing is it's not, it's not like Google like pieced out and was like, we're
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.520]   taking our app off of, you know, off of the.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   Well, why did so?
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.560]   I mean, Apple knew, I mean, it was Apple's timetable.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   They had this.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.720]   This is a question.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.960]   And I think a reasonable point, Anil Dash made the point, look, this is a, normally you'd
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.120]   think Apple protects the consumer.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.560]   It does what's right for the consumer.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.600]   Here it clearly didn't do what was right for the consumer.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   It was right from Apple.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   Right.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   Now many businesses do that.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   I do what's right for Twitter.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.360]   I don't care about you guys, but no, I'm kidding.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   I'm just kidding.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   It's a joke.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.360]   But people are walking out.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.360]   There are a lot of people here.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.160]   I think she's up there.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160]   But really why?
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.200]   I mean, that's the big problem here, right?
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.360]   Why do they do this?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.280]   I mean, iOS 6, I mean, when I saw the beta's, I was like, Oh geez, you know, Apple is making
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.480]   a business decision, right?
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.720]   Which is Google's a competitor.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.120]   They don't want to be reliant.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120]   Nobody.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.720]   Apple's biggest thing is we don't want to be reliant, so reliant on a competitor because
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.280]   if they screw up, it hurts us and they have control over us and Apple hates that, right?
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.400]   So they say, we're going to do our own mapping solution.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:22.200]   Well, that's fine, except from a customer standpoint, from all the users standpoint,
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.440]   this is a feature regression, right?
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.200]   I mean, it's like the transit is gone.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.120]   The maps aren't as accurate.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.320]   They're free driving directions now, which for an iPhone user is a big thing, although
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.440]   that's been on Android before.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.440]   So from a user standpoint, the users don't care that Apple and Google are locked in some
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.440]   sort of death struggle.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.840]   They just want their phone to work.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.400]   And if you have an iPhone 4 and you upgrade it to iOS 6, your maps are different and maybe
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.560]   not good.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.720]   And that's not friendly to--
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.040]   If you lose key functionality, I mean, I just find-- I lose key functionality and
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.800]   be able to search for things and find things.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800]   But wait--
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800]   OK, I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800]   It's just not--
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:00.240]   You can-- there are a dozen great mapping apps you could download and put on your iPhone,
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   right?
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.280]   It's not like you no longer have turn-by-turn directions.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.200]   Waze is free and is amazing.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200]   So--
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   Waze never works for me.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   Well, all right.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.200]   So motion XGB.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.800]   I mean, really, honestly, I've tried all of those apps.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.600]   I've tried the free app by tap and I've tried Waze.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   And ultimately, I found that you know what works?
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   Google.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   So you're using Google on Android.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.480]   So you're using an Android phone so that I have Google mapping.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.920]   So you really had real Google maps on iOS because they never had turn-by-turn it in
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.920]   app.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   If you're Apple, what are you going to do?
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   I mean, it's true.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   Google has the best maps, right?
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.400]   So if you're Apple, your choices are go with Google even though seemingly for-- it's
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.400]   unclear to me what the reasons are.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.560]   Their access is limited.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.080]   Is Google withholding access to turn-by-turn for Apple phones?
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   It's unclear.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   No, Apple didn't allow it.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.800]   Or-- so the question is, do you go with Google, which is what they used to do?
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.400]   Or do you say there's got to be an alternative?
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.000]   And what they chose to do is build their own and that might have been the mistake.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.440]   But I mean, I have a hard time saying, well, it's just--
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   It does not have to have been a mistake to build your own though.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.320]   I mean, I don't-- it probably won't help the industry to fall into the fallacy that
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.160]   only Google will ever know how to do this.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.960]   If any company had the resources to do it right, it probably was Apple.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.120]   They have the money.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.920]   They clearly had the time because they've been in no freaking rush to give people turn-by-turn
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920]   directions.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   So--
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.280]   And they bought their first mapping company three years ago.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   Right.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   So--
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   So--
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.860]   So-- so-- so the analysts talked to GIS professionals, reach outside of the bubble, maybe it will mean
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:30.340]   that somebody finds out that you're going to put turn-by-turn into the-- into iOS 6, but
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.340]   you know what?
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.340]   It's not like Apple has any secrets left anyway.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.120]   Do it the right way.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.400]   Here's what Horace did you said in his critical path.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.640]   He's a great analyst, by the way.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   I read his smart guy.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   Smart guy.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   Smart guy.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   Smart guy.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   Smart guy.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   He's very smart.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   His blog is very right on.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.640]   He does a podcast for five by five called CrilicalPath.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   He says, quote, and I'm sure he did it in a French accent.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.120]   I have-- does he have a French accent?
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   No.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   No, he's not.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   No.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120]   No, he's Romanian and lives in Finland.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   Romania, US citizen.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   So he sounds like this.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.520]   So he's not doing its own map, so it would be a far bigger mistake.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.400]   The mistake was not-- he says Apple should have done its map sooner.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.840]   The mistake was not getting involved in maps sooner, which was not on-- which was on Jobs
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   Watch.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.280]   Nokia, he says, saw the writing on the wall five years ago, spent $8 billion to get in
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   front of the problem.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   They bought what Navtech or Telenav?
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.440]   And Ericsson bought Telenav, right?
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:27.200]   Both of the big mobile companies at the time said, oh my God, local's going to be huge.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.200]   We better get maps.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.160]   By the way, Nokia maps are excellent.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.200]   That's what Amazon's going to start using.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.560]   It's what Nokia is putting-- is being, is using.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.800]   It's on all the Windows phones.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.320]   See, so it's not all Google.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.400]   Nokia saw the writing on the wall five years ago, burned $8 billion to get in front of the
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.400]   problem.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.160]   The pain Apple feels now is deferred, says Horace, from when they decided to hand over
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.040]   that franchise to Google in the beginning.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.320]   That was their mistake.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.240]   I think there are two things that Apple just did not see coming and still doesn't seem
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   to understand.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:59.120]   And one of them is definitely the importance of maps and the other is social.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.880]   I think that if there is any massive glaring weakness in the Apple lineup right now, it's
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880]   sharing and it's social.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   Hey, but we got pain.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   Oh.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   Well, they're unraveling.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880]   Ping is dead.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   Ping is dead.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.280]   I think Mo's motivated by many of the same things Molly mentioned about Apple's approach to
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.440]   maps, which is Apple said, OK, other people are doing social.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.440]   We should do it too.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440]   Let's just do it ourselves.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440]   Let's not ask you.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.720]   Instead of this, I think they wanted.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.920]   I think they wanted Facebook.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.200]   In fact, they announced that Facebook were putting and then Facebook turned their back
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200]   on Apple.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   Or Apple.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:35.080]   Facebook, by the way, as a corollary to that, I am amazed at what Facebook has managed
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.280]   to extract from Apple in terms of access.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.840]   Now that Facebook is integrated throughout the iPhone and the iOS 6 experience, Facebook
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.000]   is all up in your business.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.800]   Like it has never been on iOS asking for access to contacts when you enable it.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.040]   It defaults to access to your contacts and your calendar.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   You have to go and turn that off after the fact that Facebook now has unprecedented access,
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.640]   I think, to iOS 6 users the way it never did before, just so that you can have that little
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.040]   icon when you want to share a photo.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.080]   I think that's sort of a little untold story right now.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.400]   And it imports both iOS 6 and Mountline import Facebook contacts into your contacts list.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.440]   And I keep finding myself composing emails to friends and by accident selecting their
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.400]   Facebook messaging address, which is like, "No, no, no, no, no, I don't want that."
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.000]   But that's what happens when you link them up.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.160]   Well, wasn't the story and maybe it's false, but the rumor was that, and this happened
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.320]   during the ping time that Steve Jobs, in fact, I think it's in the Isaac's in book, turned
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.120]   down Facebook because they said onerous, their demands were onerous.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:43.960]   But what it came out was that Facebook wanted access to Apple's customer information.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.560]   And Apple was not willing to give them that.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.760]   But maybe times have changed or Apple just feels a squeeze and they said, "All right,
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.160]   I guess we got to do it."
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:58.120]   Now Molly, you got me going into my settings here and I'm going to turn off whatever Facebook
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120]   is wanting.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.680]   Does Twitter get the same thing?
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680]   I have to go to the same settings.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.680]   Calendar, contacts, and Facebook.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680]   Yep.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]   So, let's see.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   It'll vibrate.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.920]   It'll be under Facebook or on the phone.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   On the phone.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.360]   There's privacy settings on the phone.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.920]   So when you install the new Facebook app, there you go.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   There you go.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.760]   It was like general and then privacy maybe.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   Okay.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.160]   So it's going to generate a list here.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.560]   Actually, I like the way Apple did this.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.320]   This is something I think new in iOS 6.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.560]   It says applications have requested access to your Facebook account will appear in a
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.720]   list here than they have it.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.200]   But let me, but Twitter probably has it.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.440]   If you go to contacts, you'll see all the apps that are accessing your contacts and
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.200]   you can go in and actually turn Facebook off.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.220]   This is the kind of granularity that frankly Android could really use.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:49.320]   This is great to have that ability to say, "Well, here's what's accessing my contacts
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   today."
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.000]   Oh, I don't want Skype to get in there and to be able to turn that off is great.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   It would be nice.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.800]   I'd be surprised if they didn't have something like this eventually.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.800]   It's doable.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.800]   I'm saying there's an app for that.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.320]   The way Android does it is that it asks you about all that stuff up front and unfortunately
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.080]   it's an awful lot of stuff.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:10.200]   I think it's also harder for people to think about the context.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.640]   When you actually are using the app and you start to think about, I was using a path the
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.800]   other day on the iPad and I couldn't pull in my location.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.560]   I remember that I had actually set off--
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.560]   Turn it off.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.560]   Turn it off.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.560]   I turn off location sharing for that app and so I'd go in and fix it.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.280]   I think sometimes it's only within the context of using the app that you start to think
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.600]   about what kind of access I wanted to have.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.800]   The flaw with Android system where they show you everything before you even install it.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.120]   Well, I'm glad that they do that because if they do that it's in.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.120]   Yeah, you could do that.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.320]   I did not like having to go and change my Facebook settings after I had installed it
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.400]   and then enabled it.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.800]   I actually prefer to get all that information up front.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.920]   The big difference I think is that Apple gives you all of those settings in that granularity
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.560]   as Apple settings whereas on Android each individual app has the settings.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   We have to go app.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.400]   You can do it.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.200]   It's just a different way to use it, I guess.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.080]   I sometimes get frustrated when I open up an iOS app and I'm trying to make privacy
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.800]   settings that are just in the global privacy settings menu.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.320]   It's just a different implementation but it's all there.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.760]   So according to Darryl Etherington writing a tech crunch a couple of hours ago, Apple,
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.920]   according to his sources, is aggressively recruiting ex-Google Maps staff.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.120]   That would be the next-- the other shoot-and-drop.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.320]   It's like 18 months too late to be doing that.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   God, we get to get somebody who knows what we're doing here.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:36.840]   According to a contractor who worked on Google Maps, he says, "Many of my coworkers at Google
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.160]   Maps eventually left when their contracts ended or on their own accord.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.960]   They were doing other GIS work.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:48.440]   They'd heard rumors that Apple was going to develop its own in-house mapping program.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.880]   And Apple hired him.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.040]   He's paid handsomely as a GIS analyst.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.160]   But I think what Apple probably is fine.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.240]   I think you hit the nail on the head, Molly, when you said Apple was a little arrogant
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.280]   about this, assumed, "Hey, we're great.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   We could do it."
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.880]   And it turned out to be just a little more than they realized, a little harder to do.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.920]   I mean, I have no doubt now that it's out there that they will hire lots of people and
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.280]   spend a lot of money and that the Maps will get better.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.920]   But it's a black eye for Apple that probably didn't need to happen.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.480]   And it does make you wonder and you don't want to spend the next five years saying what
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.040]   would Steve have done.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.160]   But I mean, is some of that quality control?
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.480]   Are these the small things we will start to see where something that is...
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.320]   That's the new...
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.680]   Apple made something happen on his watch.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.680]   Apple, yes, so many mistakes they made when he was around.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.480]   It's the new bogus journalism meme, which is, "Well, Steve never would have done this."
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.360]   Yeah, he said that he did let ping out the garbage.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.360]   He was plenty of stuff.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.640]   The whole "Mobile Me" launch and the G4C.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   I think it's a...
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.080]   I bought a cube the last day it was available.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   I got...
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.080]   I went at Mac Adam.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.800]   In San Francisco and Harrison, I brought it home.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.440]   I looked online and it said the cubes but discontinued.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:03.000]   I looked at it and said, "Oh crap."
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   But you know what?
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   I love that.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   I really...
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   I totally want to get a cube on eBay.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   I wish I still had it.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   I was currently my huge obsession.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.080]   I blame William Gibson for it, but I really have to happen.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.800]   Why does William Gibson write about the cube?
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.160]   Yeah, it's in the first...
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.640]   It's in the first...
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.800]   What's the pattern recognition?
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.440]   In the one that ends with pattern recognition.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.080]   What's the one before that?
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.080]   Pattern recognition is the first one.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.720]   Yeah, that's the one.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.120]   Yeah, I liked the cube.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   It cracked.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.280]   It cracked all over the place.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.080]   It was the Mac mini before its time.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   It was cute.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.080]   It was overpriced and...
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.080]   Had no fan.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.080]   I wrote my first book on it.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   No fan.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.080]   You could put a little poll in it and then put a mini inside of it and then just have a cube
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.080]   facing.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.080]   Good idea, Molly Wood.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.480]   That's a DIY video.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.600]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:52.040]   One thing, one last story and then we're going to get off the iPhone 5, but a non-tech
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.000]   and PCMag have both done performance previews, benchmarks.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.560]   It seems to be this is not only the fastest iPhone ever, probably the fastest phone on
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.640]   the market today because Apple...
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.680]   Now here's where Apple put some big bucks in.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:10.120]   Maybe this is because of their heritage as a computer company.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   They bought PA risk.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   They put billions of dollars into better chip design.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.200]   Yeah, they've invested a lot in that.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.680]   I think that they realized that if they were going to be able to move really quickly with
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.480]   this device and do the kinds of optimizations around battery life and things like that,
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.600]   it was really important for them to develop their own chips.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.480]   They were an original investor in ARM.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.240]   Yeah, and they made a ton of money from ARM.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.240]   So this is something they kind of knew all along that was going to be...
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.080]   Ironically, this is how fast the industry moves.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.600]   That was a good investment 10 years ago.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.600]   They bought PA risk.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.600]   They got a lot of engineers.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:48.000]   Now they design their own system on a chip based on the AV7S ARM architecture.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.960]   This is why it's so hard when we say we need new companies coming in.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:58.120]   It's like Apple feels like it's necessary for them to make their own chips, to build
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.600]   their own maps, Google bought Motorola because they wanted their own phone company.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.680]   And that's the problem with these giant companies is are we in an era where you just have to
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.400]   have billions of dollars and you have to buy all this stuff and do it yourself?
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.160]   And can somebody small breakthrough if that's the case?
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:17.040]   Well, even if that somebody small manages to break through, will they be sued out of
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.520]   existence for patent infringement?
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   Or bought.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.520]   Either way.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.520]   Or bought.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.200]   Well, they'll be bought for whatever small portfolio they have.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:28.440]   But more likely if they don't want to sell, they'll be sued out of existence.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.560]   iPhone 6 in our chat room says John Carmack said the iPhone 4S pushed more pixels in
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.360]   the Xbox 360 when he reported the Quake engine to it.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.600]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.080]   And this is considerably faster.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   More than...
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080]   Apple said twice as fast.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.880]   In fact, the benchmarks confirm more than twice as fast as the 4S.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.480]   Although, let's face it.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.920]   You don't really need that much speed on a phone, do you?
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.120]   The iPhone's always been pretty smooth, but they've got all the game stuff is going to
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.120]   run faster.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120]   But yeah, it's true.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:00.240]   There are still some Android devices that don't scroll smoothly, but Apple has never
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.240]   had that problem.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.240]   No.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.240]   I'm glad they've added some more RAM.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.200]   The Gigabyte of RAM now.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.400]   Although some Android phones have two.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   S3 has two.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   S3 has two.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.000]   That's funny because Apple's never really played the specs game.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.160]   And yet this phone, at least for the moment, has pretty good specs.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160]   Very impressive.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   All right.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.160]   Enough.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.880]   It's only an hour and 18 minutes into the show.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.360]   We've got to find something else to talk about.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.360]   How about this?
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:33.960]   Twitch, which is a Justin TV project, just raised $15 million.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.520]   You know what Twitch TV is?
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.080]   You watch people play video games.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.080]   Who would have thought?
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.080]   Wow.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.800]   Who would have thought that that...
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.560]   Because we tried to do a video game show where we talked about video games.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.560]   No, no.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.560]   Mistake.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:51.040]   Every time I went on the air playing Skyrim, we got more viewers than watch the game show.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.920]   Every time Chad does his Minecraft show, people want to watch you do Minecraft, right?
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920]   They don't want to hear tips.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.920]   They say, "Just play."
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920]   Right.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.480]   They want to see from your point of view what you're playing.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   Shut up and play.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.480]   Exactly.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.240]   So Twitch, which was announced a year ago at E3, independent brand from Justin TV, is basically
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:13.040]   a YouTube where people just watch other people play video games.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.160]   But it's huge.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.320]   And it's not even YouTube because it's almost not even the on demand.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.160]   It's just live.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.920]   Because it's almost dead once it's recorded.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.120]   I know, it's what I should have done.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   Right.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.120]   What was I thinking?
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.560]   There's so many people doing it live that it's almost not even the YouTube for...
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.120]   I mean, that's not even a correct comparison.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.600]   Yeah, you're right because it's Justin.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.800]   It's streaming.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.000]   Your favorite game is the best players, the biggest events.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   This is all people want to watch.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   See, I thought this was boring.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.160]   I thought nobody wants to watch it and play video games.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.000]   How boring can you get?
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.360]   In Korea, it's like a huge spectrum sport.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   Oh, it's massive.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.560]   Well, and actually professional gaming even in the US is becoming a bigger and bigger
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.560]   deal.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.680]   There's that big event in Vegas every year that's just gotten enormous and the gamers
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.760]   are becoming more and more well known.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.320]   Again, once again, my five-year-old is all over this.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.320]   All over this.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.000]   He will watch the star, the Lego Star Wars video game footage on YouTube all day if you
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   let him.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:11.840]   It's my new...
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840]   It's my new motto.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.000]   What would Eli do?
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   Kinda.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.040]   Well, you know, we spend this billion-dollar industry to watch other people play sports,
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040]   right?
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040]   And I'm a sports fan.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.560]   I'm a big baseball football fan.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.560]   Why?
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.640]   I mean, at that point, why not video games too?
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   It's pretty much the same thing.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.360]   It's spectator sport.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.560]   This is so humble.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.000]   So on the front page, apparently there's a StarCraft II competition in two minutes, Stefano
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.880]   versus night-end.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880]   Everybody's very excited.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880]   Stefano.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   My money's on Stefano.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880]   Stefano's hot.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   He's a monster.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   He is so overrated.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.360]   You know, I have to admit, I started playing StarCraft II.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.520]   I can't believe he held out this season after the series.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.640]   I hear this is going to be a strike.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.640]   I start playing...
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.640]   I like StarCraft II.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.800]   I play StarCraft II, and then I watch these videos of these Korean players, and I thought
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   I'd give up.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.120]   You can't play.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.120]   That's crazy.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.080]   We'll tune back in a little later on and see how that's going.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.080]   How Stefano's doing?
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.040]   See how Stefano's doing.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.360]   Do they do commentary, Chad?
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:24.400]   Normally what happens is that competition, yes, there will be live casters that do commentary.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.760]   My experience is, of course, with Minecraft.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:36.000]   On Minecraft, there are known commentators like what, Kosar and things like that, that
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   you go specifically to their channel so that you can watch them play.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   Wow.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   Yeah, I watch that in the commentary.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   Right, right.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   And then if that isn't what suits your fancy, you can go and watch your favorite player,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.360]   play single player sort of thing.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.680]   And so it won't be a competition.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.800]   It'll just be them playing through the single player game sort of style.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.600]   So there's even niches within the niche.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.960]   That's what I found difficult with gaming was that you can't do a gaming show.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.560]   Because it's too diverse a community.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.560]   Right, right.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.760]   You need to stick with something that Minecraft.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   Right, right.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.240]   That was my bet.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.240]   Excuse me.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.840]   A plug for OMG craft.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   Thanks.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.840]   Just on when.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.480]   OMG craft is on Thursday nights at around seven o'clock.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.040]   We talk about, and that's a little bit different.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.680]   You could watch it here on the twitch.tv.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.280]   Look at the, they've already got.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.360]   There he is, Chad.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.200]   He's got the screaming groupies.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.200]   The flames, the explosions.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.000]   Holy cow.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.720]   How long Chad before you're doing playing Minecraft before a crowd of 10,000?
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.200]   You know, a few days.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.600]   I tell you.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.440]   I missed a bet there.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.600]   Hey, there is Microsoft news.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.720]   Actually some really good Microsoft news.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.440]   They've announced the pricing on Office 2013 and it's a subscription.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:13.000]   For 99 bucks a year, you will get Office 2013 for Mac or you can use it on PC for, I guess
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.200]   it's the Office 2010 for the PC.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.600]   You kind of rent it for up to five PCs.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.920]   So let's see, five, it's $20.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.560]   So that's like per PC, two bucks a month or something for the, for Office.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.640]   Microsoft's been wanting to do this for a long time.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.080]   So they definitely have been subscription pricing.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.240]   I mean, they're really trying to rethink, you know, how they operate as a software business.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.760]   They realize that they're starting to realize that things have really changed, that they
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.160]   have started operating much differently than they did before.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.480]   I mean, that's very aggressive pricing.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.480]   It should be though.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.000]   I mean, it's, it is increasingly hard to articulate a benefit to an office home users,
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.840]   particularly to using Office over open office or even Google.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.200]   And there are benefits, right?
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.120]   I mean, this software still is better.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.120]   There's no question.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.680]   You're still going to get more functionality from Word.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.920]   You're still going to get, you know, PowerPoint is still going to be better than Google presentations,
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.360]   obviously.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.120]   But it's hard to explain that to people when you're talking about $400 versus zero.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.120]   Right.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   They have to do this.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:18.400]   In other words, $8.33 a month, basically.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:25.680]   You get Outlook, all the basic office apps, Outlook Excel, PowerPoint.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.040]   I don't know if you probably don't get access.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:34.120]   You probably get, but you get the basics and you get 60 minutes of Skype world calling
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.920]   a month and you get office on demand that streams the apps to Windows 7 or 8 PCs.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.720]   And it's all the current versions too, which means you're never out of date and you get
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.920]   to use whatever they wire in for their cloud services.
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   Everybody's on it.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.920]   Oh, that's right.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.080]   You also get, I think, 20 more gigs of storage on SkyDrive.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080]   It's a pretty good deal.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.920]   You know, considering all that and considering that you get Excel, which--
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.160]   Word Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, that's an Outlook.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160]   That's what I forget.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.280]   Yeah, I mean Excel to me is the one that cannot be-- that can't be replaced.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280]   Nothing.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.720]   That is an unbelievably powerful program.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.760]   That's why we still buy PCs in the office because the business people all want to use
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   Excel.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.800]   We tried to get them to use Google Docs and they said--
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   Oh, Google Spreadsheets is not--
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.800]   Excuse me?
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.800]   It's not good.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.800]   Oh, no you didn't.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.600]   You're going to run a business on Excel.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600]   Well, we don't.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.400]   We don't run it on the Google Docs.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.400]   Interesting.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.080]   So that's coming early next year.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080]   So good.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080]   We got a Microsoft story.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080]   See?
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:40.040]   I think we drummed up a remarkable amount of excitement, too.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.280]   We seemed to be required.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.640]   Microsoft's still in business.
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:46.880]   Hey, will Google release Google Maps for iOS?
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   I think so.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   Absolutely.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   But when?
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   There was a rumor.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   I don't know how true.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.880]   They were saying I heard not until Christmas.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.480]   Then I heard a rumor had been released, but they were waiting for Apple.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.680]   No, that got batted down.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:57.680]   Just don't--
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.080]   Double gave one of his trademark nopes on that one.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.320]   But it's only a matter of time.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.640]   And in the meantime, you can actually go to maps.google.com and mobile safari and save
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.400]   it out to your home screen.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.400]   That's what I did.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.560]   And it works OK.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.560]   It's not bad.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560]   Apple will approve it.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.560]   But I'm sure they'll approve it.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.920]   Apple will approve it because if they don't, they're just helping build a case against themselves
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   for antitrust trouble.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:18.920]   They already got trouble.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.920]   They've really changed their approach on that, too.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920]   Like, you know, the Amazon--
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.920]   Google Voice, they've got the intro.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   They've got the intro.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   The video is in the store.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   Netflix is in the store.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.920]   There are lots of competitors to call them.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:27.920]   They're happy--
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.920]   I heard you have the Justice Department really changed their approach.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:31.920]   Yes.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.920]   They got spanked.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.920]   Iran-ready's domestic internet system.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.440]   This is one way to handle the internet.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.200]   Make your own internet in quotes.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   In a box.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.480]   It's so called internet.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.440]   It says it makes it more secure.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.440]   Mm.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.320]   Let's call this an internet.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]   Intranet.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320]   Yeah, the Iranian intranet.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320]   No Gmail.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.600]   We just call it the Irannet.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.000]   No Google.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   At all.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   Who?
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.920]   That's because of the anti-Islamic film on YouTube, of course.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.800]   Well, you got to protect everybody from information.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   Facebook.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   Uh-uh.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   No.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   I don't know about the Twitter.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.960]   Oh, I'm sure that's not in there.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   I'm thinking no.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.960]   I'm going to have Lee toward, huh-uh.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   No, no on the Twitter.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   Okay.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   They're going to block it all.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.280]   They're going to stay on the inner toy.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:27.440]   But, I mean, not that-- I'm not sure how so successful or good it's going to be for them
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.280]   in the long run, but there's always a risk of fragmenting the internet.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280]   Right.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.280]   And it's a big risk.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.880]   We've been hearing that this could possibly happen in China.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880]   Right.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.880]   China and the fragment.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:43.320]   And it really just has to do with the DNS servers and breaking that system and all of
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.960]   a sudden you can't get from here to there.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.920]   It's-- I mean, even just with the Great Firewall, you see that covering Apple and
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.760]   seeing what they've done with iOS 6 and Mountain Lion, I mean, there are huge numbers
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.680]   of features that are underneath the surface unless it senses that you're in China.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.240]   And then it just sort of flips everything around and says, instead of Twitter and Facebook,
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.560]   here are all these Chinese services because those existing services are just blocked.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.760]   So it really is like a second set of internet preferences if you're in China.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:09.760]   Mm-hmm.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.840]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Mollie Wood, Peter Rojas, Jason Snell.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.920]   Did Tom do a week ahead?
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:17.920]   He did?
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:19.080]   Before he left for the wedding.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.360]   Let's see what's coming up on the week ahead.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.600]   And then we'll tell you what we missed, what you might have missed this week on Twitter.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   Tom.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.000]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll keep an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   today.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.360]   Of course, today, September 23rd is the fourth anniversary of the release of the T-Mobile
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.800]   G1, the first phone with Android on it.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:41.680]   Tuesday, September 25th, no one will be coming into work because World of Warcraft
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.840]   Mists of Pandaria launches.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.240]   Also that's the beginning of Blackberry Jam America's conference in San Jose.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.480]   And the first slim PS3 comes out in North America.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:55.120]   That's the 250 GB model for $270.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:59.880]   Thursday, September 27th, Google claims it was founded on this date in 1998.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:04.440]   Also Intel is having a big Windows 8 event with lots of big name partners.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.880]   Simple.tv's DVR for iPhone, iPad, Roku, and the web ships for $149.
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.520]   And Thursday is also RIM's earnings report.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:19.280]   Friday, September 28th, Europeans will be able to buy the 500 GB redesigned PS3 slim with
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.520]   one of a number of bundled games for $299.99.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:29.680]   Also on that day, the FCC is voting on a proposal to auction the UHF spectrum.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.440]   And iPhone 5 comes to cricket wireless here in the US.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:39.840]   Finally, Saturday, September 29th is WWJC, the jailbreak con in San Francisco.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840]   Back to you.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   Nice, easy to it.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840]   Before you buy.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840]   Go ballistic!
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   Oh, God!
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:47.840]   Oh, God!
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840]   Oh, God!
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840]   The Socialout.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.840]   And that is a straight up Leoliport unboxing.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.840]   Should I try scratching?
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:55.840]   No!
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.840]   Oh, no!
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.840]   That's, I mean, that's user error.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.840]   Tech news today.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.840]   And if you're editing my column, do not change D-A-M-T-C-A-M-N.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.840]   I know the difference.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840]   It's all about Android.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:11.400]   But if you don't want to be compatible, then don't expect help from OHA members that
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:15.680]   are all working to support and build a unified Android ecosystem.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.680]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.680]   Thank you for coming on the show.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.680]   We really appreciate you being here.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.240]   This week in Google, you are not Google's customer.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.680]   You are its product.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:27.360]   Will the driverless technology just be about getting us from point to point?
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.240]   Or about tracking how we got there and what we did along the way?
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240]   I5 for the iPhone.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.240]   Number one.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:41.360]   And this is a really big number one because we get a brand new iPhone.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:46.360]   If you missed this week on Twitch, you missed a lot.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.680]   By the way, just so you know the bottom line, I scored that thing with it and it did not
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.680]   scratch the...
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.680]   Where to go?
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.680]   My iPhone is gone.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680]   It's in his store.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:57.680]   Oh, there it is.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.680]   It's so small.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:02.240]   It just disappears.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:07.480]   Before we go on, I want to talk a little bit about freshbooks.com, a fabulous solution
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:10.680]   for accounting for small businesses.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.640]   If you're in business for yourself, you love getting paid, but you probably hate doing
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.040]   invoices and all the paperwork, you got to look at freshbooks.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.080]   In fact, I started using freshbooks in 2004.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.520]   Now, I think...
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.520]   How many people...
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.240]   Since 2004, freshbooks...
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.080]   They have...
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   I think it's like...
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.120]   Yeah, three and a half million people have used freshbooks to do their invoices.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.760]   They get paid faster because the invoice has a pay me button in it and clients pay faster.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.800]   If they don't, it's easy to create a tickler.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.800]   And now they've got...
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.720]   I don't know if you've seen it, the iPhone app is fantastic for freshbooks.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.880]   It lets you do everything you would do in freshbooks on your iPhone, including keep track
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:53.720]   of hours so that you can support those time sheets right into the invoices automatically.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.520]   And your accountant will love you a tax time because you've got everything all done, all
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.800]   wired up, makes it easy.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.280]   Just give them a report printed out from freshbooks.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.840]   And by the way, speaking of printing, if you want to send a physical invoice, and I know
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.440]   they're occasionally clients who really want that, freshbooks will do that too, you're
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440]   going to love freshbooks.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.800]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:15.280]   You get 30 days of unlimited use, everything, all the features, all the clients, staff,
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.280]   everything.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.000]   No limits, just sign up at freshbooks.com.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.040]   And if they ask you, tell them you heard about it on Twitch, click that green button
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.480]   says, "Twilight, try it free for 30 days."
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.880]   Cloud accounting, done right, done elegant.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.280]   It's so cool.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.280]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.440]   You see, the Coursera has signed up.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440]   What was it?
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.680]   33 new universities.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680]   That is a...
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.560]   I am really excited about the future of education, and it has nothing to do with institutions
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.560]   anymore.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.560]   It's all done on the internet.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.920]   Google and Khan Academy are watching a contest on YouTube.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.400]   Where's the story on...
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.480]   Just looking through our story list on Coursera.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.280]   Oh, my daughter's about to turn 11.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.200]   I'm starting to wonder if college will even be what we think of it.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.200]   Even high school.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   And that's seven years away.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.600]   So, COUR, S-E-R-A.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.240]   They've got classes from MIT, from Stanford, from...
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.840]   And these are all free.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.840]   There are...
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.520]   It says now, "One and a half million people using this."
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.080]   This is just so cool.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.560]   Khan Academy is amazing.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.280]   Berkeley School of Music, Duke, Emory Rice.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.480]   Well, the economics of higher education are changing so rapidly that I think a lot of
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:35.960]   a lot of schools are thinking that there's some basic education that they just don't
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.200]   need to do in the traditional environment anymore.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.200]   So, it could be...
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.840]   I feel like we're headed for a crack-up in education where it's just not...
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.760]   There's going to be a couple of years and it's not going to be anything recognizable anymore.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.480]   Well, it needs to be.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.920]   The change will happen a lot more slowly than we might want it to.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.440]   It is one of the most entrenched...
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.760]   Well, you know, the thing, as with most, I think, dramatic changes like that, the thing
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:01.760]   that will keep it in place is infrastructure and also certification.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.560]   You can go to whatever online university you want, but if you can't get a job with that
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.360]   diploma, that will sort of keep it from overtaking Ivy League or overtaking the institution.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.560]   And I think, you know, Peter's right, we have, as with, again, so many things, we have the
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:23.520]   technology to affect super disruptive change in education, but the institutional traditions
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.280]   will probably keep it in place.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.960]   Keep it alive for a little longer, but it's a revolution, no question.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.560]   I mean, I think a lot of it has to do with, you know, the change, you know, industries
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.880]   that are more meritocratic or skills-based.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.760]   So I think, you know, for instance, if you're looking at hiring an engineer, you don't
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.600]   necessarily care about their degree as much as the skills that they have in the industry.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.000]   But if they're building a bridge, you'd probably like to have a sort of...
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.680]   I mean, computer engineering, you know, programming.
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.560]   But I think that, like, if you're talking about, you know, I want to go to law school
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.680]   or, you know, I mean, I'm just saying, it really depends on the industry and where you're
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.680]   at.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:01.640]   And if anything, all signs indicate that the people are starting to value higher education
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.280]   and it's becoming more competitive to get into top universities because people view
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.280]   getting a development-
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280]   That's interesting.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.920]   ... an Ivy League school or a top school as, not to say a guarantee, but one of the few
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.920]   ways that you can actually get a leg up.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.560]   But are they right?
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.440]   Because the other thing we're seeing is that people are being saddled with huge debt
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.840]   while coming out of four-year schools and they can't even pay it off.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.800]   I mean, there's a whole generation, your generation, that's just screwed.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.600]   Well, what it is is like, if you're in the top, you know, if you're in the...
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.600]   If you're in the...
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   ... the field, Princeton...
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.800]   Yeah, if you're right at the top, you have a big advantage.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.000]   And that's why it's creating a lot of anxiety for parents in the middle class because, you
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.240]   know, it's becoming very expensive to pay for those schools.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.120]   And it's not just paying for the tuition.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:46.400]   It's actually all of the support, you know, in terms of what you have to offer in terms
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.600]   of tutors or after-school programs or...
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.600]   Tell me about it.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.600]   You know, prep...
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.640]   You're speaking to somebody who's sitting right there doing it.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:58.240]   And I think that it shows that, you know, there still is a tremendous value to getting
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.240]   one of those...
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.000]   You have to agree from one of those institutions.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000]   It's how...
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.800]   I think that the technology is going to change the lower end of the market first.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.880]   And already starting to.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880]   And not...
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:14.040]   And people in developing nations may be even more so than in the industrial world, right?
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.040]   Where they can...
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:21.840]   If you can get online in your poor kid somewhere in Peru and you can get online and take courses
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.440]   from MIT, you could teach yourself to be a great programmer.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.240]   And it looks like if you want to be a programmer.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.680]   But it's like if you want to be, you know, get a...
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:29.680]   A doctor, maybe not.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.680]   Maybe not.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:31.680]   Maybe not.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.680]   Maybe not.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.320]   It's not necessarily, you know, the best path to moving up.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320]   What grade is Eli in?
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.680]   It's kind of a dangerous trend because of what we have then in the US is fierce competition
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.120]   to get into the top schools only.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.320]   And those become the only ones that are valuable.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.160]   And then we have the rest of the developing world being able to learn skills online.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:53.600]   We do kind of lock ourselves into this untrained workforce kind of problem.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.160]   What grade is Eli in?
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.760]   He just started kindergarten.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.760]   Oh, see.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.760]   It's been horrible.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760]   So, but...
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.760]   It's been fine.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.760]   It's been fun.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.760]   It's been hard for mama.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.720]   But it's really true that by the time he's ready for college in 12 years, it will be
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:08.720]   a different world.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.720]   It will be a different world.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.720]   Completely.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.760]   And the idea that he can either go to Yale or be mediocre is a little upsetting.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.680]   I mean, there will be some alternative for him.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.680]   There always is.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.040]   I used to think that the scenario was very much what you described.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.160]   But at Walt Mossberg's De-conference, I saw the president of Stanford speak.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.800]   And he said that they're really embracing online education and think that, I mean, the
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.040]   institution's not going to go away.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.680]   The buildings are very expensive and all of that.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.040]   But I think even those institutions are realizing that what they do is going to change.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.280]   Now, he talked a lot about certificates.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.840]   And how there's some people who maybe don't need a traditional degree.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.400]   They just need a certification program.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:51.280]   But even the big institutions like Stanford are thinking about it.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.680]   But in terms of the job market, which is, I mean, the labor force is a mismatch.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.720]   There's a disconnect between what we have, the skills in the labor force and the jobs
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.640]   that need to be filled right now.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:09.200]   And I think that what we're seeing is that for a lot of middle-class parents, for example,
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.720]   they do see that for their children, one of the few ways that they feel like there might
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:20.720]   be some job security or some opening into upper-class mobility is to get a degree from
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720]   one of those places.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.680]   That's just a reality of it.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.600]   I think that that's the old school, right?
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.960]   And we are in transition.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.960]   So what's going to happen next?
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.800]   No, no, I'm saying these things are both happening at the same time.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.200]   But what it is is that, you know, because there is so much anxiety around...
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   It's horrible.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.200]   It's tremendous.
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.360]   I look at the kids, you know, my daughter's 20, my son's 18, and I look at her peer group
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.880]   and the anxiety, the nervousness of, you know, they have no idea what they're facing.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:50.440]   No, if you graduate from a mid-tier university with a lot of debt, you're in big trouble.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.760]   And that's what spawned the Occupy movement because there aren't those...
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.600]   There aren't great upper-middle-class jobs for, you know, there aren't as many great upper-middle-class
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.040]   jobs for those graduates anymore.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.560]   So tech-sarielves can't conocademy solve this.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.200]   I mean, the flight to Ivy League is a fear, a response to fear.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.200]   No question.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.800]   And I actually don't think, you know, despite what everything I just said, I don't think
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.600]   that that will be a long-term trend.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.600]   It's temporary.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.200]   It is unquestionably what people are doing now because it's been the safest way historically
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.200]   to ensure yourself a good job.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:29.160]   Now that there are virtually no jobs, you plead to what is the safest course.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.440]   But technology is absolutely going to, I think, it's unstoppable.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.880]   It is going to continue to disrupt education.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.040]   And it may, however, take a couple of decades or even a generation because as someone in
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.640]   the chat room put it brilliantly, which is as long as the people who are doing the hiring
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.840]   had to go to college, you're probably not...
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.560]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.560]   You're right.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.560]   They're going to look for the degree.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.560]   The current...
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.560]   It's not just about...
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:58.560]   That's why my point earlier, which is when you have jobs where it's less about having
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:03.720]   a credential and more about having specific skill sets, then you can see that online
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.600]   education, free online education, never really transformed it of impact, right?
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.600]   Like in computer programming.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.560]   But like I was saying, if you want to become a lawyer or a doctor or university professor,
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:18.400]   you know, or whatever, it's a little tougher because there is still a system in which
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.800]   having a credential from a top university does have a meaningful impact in your ability
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.280]   to get a good job in that industry.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.720]   We certainly don't care what kind of education art staff has.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   That's clear.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   Society.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.720]   Society.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:32.720]   Look.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.720]   I mean, is that...
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720]   Do you know?
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.720]   Is it part of the...
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.720]   If you're a writer, you don't care about the...
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]   I don't care.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.840]   I mean, we would like to have a college degree beyond that.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.840]   You would.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:42.840]   You do look for a B.A.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.840]   You do look for a B.A.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:44.840]   You do look for a B.A.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:45.840]   You prefer to have a college degree.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.600]   Because when they were in college, did they actually do something?
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.080]   Were they on the college newspaper?
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.080]   Did they write?
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.960]   If you have an English degree or even a writing degree and then you show me no evidence,
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.720]   you actually wrote when you were in college, that's what is a killer.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.280]   But, you know, I don't know.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.560]   I feel like the way that these big universities will change first is just that you'll...
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.960]   Instead of going there for four years and taking all those basic classes, you may do
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.640]   that online to qualify and then show up.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.640]   And more like a junior college transfer has been traditionally.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.640]   I don't know.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:21.920]   The real scandal is an academic article which were paid for by many cases by a government.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.640]   We should own them.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.840]   And yet the people who publish these online make huge amounts of money and download fees.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.240]   And Aaron Schwartz does not like that.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:36.200]   He is a well-known coder, an activist at MIT.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.160]   Was it read it?
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.920]   I think it was read it that he started.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:42.320]   Well, I think there's a dispute between the...
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.960]   Oh, maybe Alex doesn't agree about that.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960]   Maybe Alex quite do things that I can't make.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:46.960]   Who is this guy?
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.960]   He was there very early, but I'm not sure.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.400]   In any event, he's not some guy off the street.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.920]   No, he's definitely a personal lot of credibility and technology space.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.840]   And actually, I do an event called Seven on Seven in New York every year where we bring
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.360]   seven artists and seven technology people together to give him the 24 hours to come
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.360]   up with something.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.120]   And he was one of the technology people we had last year.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.120]   So you know this guy.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:10.880]   He's charged with 13 felonies intentionally because he intentionally downloaded academic
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.000]   articles from a database at MIT.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.200]   He's the executive director of a company called, or a group called Demand Progress.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.640]   He's done this before.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.920]   He's free on Bob, but he faces literally faces dozens of years in prison and a million dollar
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.560]   fine for these felony counts.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.880]   I agree with what he's doing though.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:39.040]   I mean, he's really trying to show that these academic articles, they belong to all of us.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.840]   Yeah, I think there's a lot of people who are doing this.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.280]   It's a little bit of a, I mean, he did, it's a little bit of a grayer.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:47.280]   I mean, he did break some sort of a law.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.960]   I mean, I think that it should not be something that you could face a million dollar fine
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.720]   in years in prison for whatever he did.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.920]   Well, this is the, and certainly might be a chance for us to review, you know, it definitely
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.960]   is a broad interpretation of a law.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.720]   He's being charged with 13 felonies for breaking terms of service against.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.640]   Yeah, that's what's so remarkable.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.600]   Where there or not we are all in fact entitled to free access to these papers.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.160]   The fact that he's being charged with 13 felonies over terms of service is a little upsetting.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.240]   So the government is using the Computer Front and Abuse Act.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:23.320]   It was passed in '84 to enhance the government's ability to prosecute hackers stealing information.
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:29.960]   However, lately the government has been interpreting the anti-hacking provisions to include activities
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:34.520]   such as, and I'm reading from Wired's Threat Level blog, violating a website's term of
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:38.440]   service or a company's computer usage policy.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.480]   But he didn't just go in and like cut and paste a few things.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.560]   He actually scraped it.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.360]   He set up like a server in the closet, a computer in the closet and like started scraping the
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.360]   data.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.840]   And he spoofed MAC addresses.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:57.280]   Well, and I mean they charge, I think it's a meter, it's meter access to the database.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:00.440]   And I think that, you know, they didn't want him copying the entire database and putting
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.160]   it out there for free because they do charge for access to it.
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:06.160]   I think the question is, like you said, I mean, this is a data that should be out there
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.160]   for free.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.800]   Well, that's his position.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.600]   That's the one political argument.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:15.720]   And then there's the other question of should the feds be using these anti-hacking laws to
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:18.520]   prosecute people who essentially violate terms of service?
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.960]   I mean, it's, you know, it's-
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:21.960]   Well, yeah.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.600]   It adds more of these.
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.600]   It's true.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.760]   It may be a violation of terms of service, but the actions were unquestionably the actions
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.040]   of a hacker, like bringing in unauthorized hardware and setting up MAC servers to, or
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.040]   spoofing MAC addresses to set up service to scraped data.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.360]   Terms of service is just the name of the law that they're using in this case, I think.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.360]   Right.
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.480]   I mean, you know, you can, I mean, if anything, he's maybe to be charged with copyright violation
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:52.120]   or something, not for copying the data and, you know, threatening to redistribute it.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:57.640]   But I don't think this is hacking in the sense that we would normally think of hacking.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:01.800]   It seems like a kind of an obscure thing to fall on your sort over.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:07.880]   Well, I disagree. I think actually it's a pretty serious issue.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.480]   I mean, it must be. This is a really smart person and he's chosen to fall on his sort
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.480]   over it.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:16.120]   So if anything, I feel like I'm reading this thinking, "Okay, what am I missing?"
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:19.040]   It reminds me a little of WikiLeaks.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.520]   You know, he's hacking for the common good, I would say.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.960]   And it's mild hacking.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.640]   So my question is, at what point does the fact that he used a computer and did-
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.640]   And committed a crime?
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.200]   Let's say he committed a crime.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.360]   At what point is that no longer relevant as an intensifier?
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.840]   A lot of these hacking laws came into effect because computers were new and the laws hadn't
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.840]   caught up to them.
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.160]   And now I've seen multiple instances where people who were doing something that was
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:52.840]   probably not illegal or if it was, it was barely illegal, but it was on a computer.
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.840]   A computer.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.840]   And they got charged with felonies and had just their lives not necessarily ruined, but
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.200]   severely harmed.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.760]   And it's a little like saying, "Well, a gun was used in commission of a crime."
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:06.760]   It's just a computer.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:07.760]   It's not just a computer.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:08.760]   It's a computer going to jail.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.400]   At some point, what you did on the computer should be what you should be charged with
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.760]   and not the fact that a computer was you.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.760]   That's not a lot of it.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.760]   It seems like more like a copyright issue.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.760]   Right.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:20.280]   He stole the content and then distributed it illegally and why wouldn't you charge him
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.360]   with that because that is illegal?
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.360]   Why did-
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.360]   Setting up computers.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.320]   Even if a lot of that content is public domain, you can copyright a database of-
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.320]   Right.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.320]   Right.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.800]   I mean, maybe that shouldn't be allowed, but I mean, you can copyright a database of public
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.800]   domain facts.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.000]   I mean, certainly people, you know, the part that's good about them falling on is sort
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.440]   on about this is it is important for people to realize that the government has what, you
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.760]   know, in its infinite wisdom vis-a-vis computers, chosen to interpret anti-hacking provisions
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:52.840]   in such a broad way so that almost anybody, and there was the- and again, in this threat
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:57.480]   level blog, millions of unsuspecting individuals could find that they're engaging in criminal
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:05.640]   contact because you can be charged to such an extreme degree when, as you say, you should
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.600]   have been charged with stealing, right, or copyright infringement or something like that.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.840]   But the fact that all of those Ulas could combine to be such a serious crime is pretty
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.400]   disturbing because it is the kind of thing people could do without realizing.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.400]   Kickstarter is changing its rules a little bit.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.720]   I've been the only one in the world who's been bugged by Kickstarter only because I feel
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.720]   like it's-
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:31.240]   It looks like it's a marketplace like you're an investor and really you're just giving
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:34.040]   somebody money and you're hoping it works out well.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:38.680]   Kickstarter is banning product renderings and is now requiring project owners to be more
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.160]   open about the risk, which I think is appropriate.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:49.160]   They require creators to disclose any risks and challenges a project may face.
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:52.880]   The problem is I think people are, I think, like for instance, the pebble watch.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.680]   You feel like, oh, I'm giving them money to buy a watch.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:00.800]   You're missing everything that goes in between the drawing of a watch and the actual distribution
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.640]   of a watch.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.560]   People like funding stuff on Kickstarter and Indiegogo on the other side because they feel
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.520]   like they're being part of a moment, a cultural moment, and they're participating in something
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.840]   in a way that goes beyond just buying something, actually helping something make happen.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:17.840]   Making something happen.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.840]   Right.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.840]   Right.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.200]   And a sophisticated person understands that.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:28.720]   Yeah, and I think the problem is that as Kickstarter gets more and more awareness grows and people
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.160]   are using it more and more and realizing that it's not just a way to get your product funded,
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.520]   it's a way to build awareness of it and launch a product.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.760]   I'm seeing people who don't need to use Kickstarter, don't need the money, just to get publicity.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760]   That's a marketing tool, yeah.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760]   It's a marketing tool.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.400]   And I think in some respects, those are the people who are best able to fill because
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.720]   if they have the resources already.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.720]   They built it once.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:50.720]   Right.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:56.000]   But I think it's a real challenge for Kickstarter because I mean, I know the founders and I
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.880]   guess the disclosure, I guess we share investors with them.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.360]   So I'm not sure that really impurities me.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.120]   Well, but you have many sides inside into this.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.120]   That's good.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:05.720]   They are, they aren't necessarily, they didn't necessarily start Kickstarter to fund hardware
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.720]   projects.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.800]   They really, you know, it may be that it Kickstarter, it's hard for Kickstarter to encompass all
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:15.120]   these different kinds of products or services and arts.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.680]   But it was supposed to be for the arts.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.680]   It's supposed to be for the arts.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.520]   It may be that Kickstarter can't be all things to all people when it comes to crowdfunding
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.080]   projects and maybe there needs to be a Kickstarter for hardware that has, you know, that vets
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:31.680]   the projects, the products in a different way that Kickstarter is never going to be able
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.000]   to because they don't want to do that.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.680]   Because if you're funding a novel or a play or a movie, you kind of understand what you're
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.680]   getting into.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.000]   But if you're funding a product, it might feel like you're buying a product.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.360]   And that's what, I think this is exactly what they should have said is what they said,
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.160]   Kickstarter is not a store.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.880]   And I think that there's a lot of new people on K-…
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:56.840]   When you, Pebble Watch raises $10 million, mostly for people who are buying Pebble watches,
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:59.720]   I think people think, "Oh, I'm getting an early on a product."
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.720]   But this is a product that doesn't exist.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.160]   The Uya raised $8 million.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160]   It may never exist.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.160]   It does.
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.880]   It's a, I think there's a big risk involved.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:13.320]   And I think that, you know, a growing risk is more and more people try to, you know, fund
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:16.840]   their products on Kickstarter and think it's a little bit of a shortcut.
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:17.840]   And don't really.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.960]   And this is, people don't realize that hardware is, it's getting easier to make hardware.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.360]   I think we, you know, you can do a whole podcast about that a whole lot.
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.360]   It is.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360]   That's exciting.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.360]   But it's still hard.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.360]   You still have to know what you're doing.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.360]   Right.
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.040]   And even if you manage to build hardware, you still have to fulfill and you still have
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:37.120]   to be able to, you know, I mean, you have to manufacture at scale after you manage to
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.680]   build the first.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.120]   So that's one of the things they're doing.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:43.480]   The other thing that's gotten easier, it's gotten really easy to make 3D videos that look
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.480]   like they're real.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:48.720]   So they're saying, look, you can't post a product simulation.
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:51.680]   You can't simulate things the product might do if it doesn't do it now.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.480]   You can't put a picture on that is not of actual, the actual prototype as it currently
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.480]   exists.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480]   In other words, you can't over promise.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.520]   Wait, you mean you can't only do things that you're allowed to get away with from
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.520]   the US patent office?
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.520]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.520]   They're strict.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.520]   They're higher bar.
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.440]   I think this is the right thing to do.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.840]   And this actually responds to all the concerns I've had about Kickstarter.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:16.640]   Because I think we were getting rapidly into that environment where people thought they
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:17.640]   were buying stuff.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:22.920]   No, I have an idea for a project related to this that we should talk about a later afterwards.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:23.920]   Okay, good.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.720]   I love Kickstarter and I wanted to succeed.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.720]   You know, if you say it, I'll definitely be calmering.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.720]   This is why they have to do this.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.720]   Yeah, no, I did.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:31.800]   Well, I think there's not ready to announce it yet.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.800]   The Uya and the Pebble were the two that really kind of precipitated this.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:38.080]   These guys got the millions of dollars in just a few days.
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.040]   And they are physical.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.280]   You know, I mean, this is the Uya.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.000]   And I don't think that's, I don't know how much of this is a real thing or how much of
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]   it is a picture of a thing or?
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.080]   Well, they, I mean, they're, I think that they will deliver just based on the people
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.280]   that I know they are involved with it.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:58.960]   But you know, you do see people that put products out there and it's clear that they
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:02.080]   have no expertise to be able to deliver what they're, what they're talking about.
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.440]   And the thing is, it's a little bit like the Dunning Kruger effect.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:07.560]   Like they are not even like aware that they are not able to do that.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:08.560]   Right.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.560]   You know, like they think they want to do it.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.560]   Something they're trying to really belong.
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:11.560]   They're not dishonest.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.800]   They like fully intend to do this.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.640]   And then they, they, they raise the money and then they start working on their like, oh,
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:19.840]   you, you know, I don't know any of us circuit boards or, you know, what happens when they
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:22.280]   spend all their money and there's no product.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:23.280]   Right.
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:24.280]   It's it.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:25.280]   There's no recourse.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:29.360]   And actually I think Kickstarter has been somewhat clear about this, but they might want
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:32.200]   to be a little more explicit and saying, look, there's a good chance you were going to lose
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:33.880]   all your money here.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.680]   They definitely need to be more explicit about that.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.240]   I think it's, it's highly unclear whether you will get your money back if the product
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.320]   doesn't ship and it's to their own benefit to do that.
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:43.320]   Really?
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:45.920]   I mean, I think what happened is Kickstarter got super cool and then everyone went out
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.360]   looking for a Kickstarter to be part of.
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.400]   And, and so it became sort of a self fulfilling hype machine and all of a sudden people were
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.680]   just like, I don't know, throw money at that thing.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:59.360]   And, and it's too, it would, it will be who Kickstarter, I think, to be very straightforward
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:05.640]   about what it means and to position it strongly as an investment.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.760]   Or risky, a highly, highly risky investment as opposed to eBay.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:16.200]   And as Techless says in our chat, where most businesses fail and, you know, that's just
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:17.720]   the fact that that's right for life.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.720]   Make it way more shark tank and way less Amazon.
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:23.560]   Well, then you throw in the whole stretch goals phenomenon, which is almost like a different
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.560]   thing, right?
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:27.800]   Where you're using Kickstarter as a way.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:29.800]   We're going to make the next Facebook.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:30.800]   Right.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.960]   It's like, well, if you, and then all you're really using it as a shopping cart where you're
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.400]   like, you know, $15 gets you this, $50 gets you this.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:41.160]   It's good marketing, but it's, it's not really, you're not really funding at that point.
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:43.680]   You're just marketing your different products at different levels.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.960]   It's more like a PBS pledge drive.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.960]   I didn't understand Peter.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.400]   I'm glad you explained it to me that it was originally aimed at creative projects.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.400]   That makes a lot more sense.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.400]   And that's, and that's the founder's passion.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.440]   And it was really actually about music and, you know, getting people.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.000]   Making an album, making a movie.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.600]   And when it works, like Andy Bayo just did the XOXO conference and that was funded entirely
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.600]   by Kickstarter.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:06.800]   And he's one of the Kickstarter advisors and that worked perfectly.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.960]   And I think that, you know, for non-hardware, I mean, I think that, that they're just barriers
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.760]   to that hardware that exists for hardware that just don't exist for most other things.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:18.760]   Exactly.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:21.160]   We're going to take a break then I'll talk about the candy bar that will find you.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.320]   But first, let's talk about Audible.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:29.000]   I actually, I whipped out my Kindle HD fire because there's something Audible does on here
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.080]   that actually is very, very cool.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:36.280]   If you have an Audible book, a text, you know, a Kindle book, rather, not an Audible book,
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:39.960]   and you have the Audible audio of it, when you're reading the Kindle book, this is a
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:42.680]   Agatha Christie book, Amazon was giving away public domain.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.760]   When you're reading the book or listening to the book on Audible, it actually highlights
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:52.840]   the text on the Kindle as you're reading, which is very cool.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.520]   And now they've added whisper sync to Audible.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:58.080]   So if you're reading, let's say you're reading the book like this and then you get in your
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.280]   car and you want to listen, Audible will jump to that point in the audio book.
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.280]   Is that not cool?
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.080]   Is that not awesome?
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:06.880]   Audible is just fantastic.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.440]   I do want you to get the Audible app.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:15.520]   If you're not an Audible listener yet, visit Audible.com right now and become an Audible
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.520]   listener.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:18.000]   In fact, I'm going to show you how you can get an Audible book for free.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000]   I thought I had Audible on here.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]   Well, I have it on every other device.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000]   You're an Audible listener, right?
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000]   I love audio books from Audible.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.880]   But the app is great, so immediately whenever I get anything like my new iPhone 5, the first
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.560]   thing I do is I put Audible on here.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:37.280]   Then one of the nice things about Audible is your entire library of every book you've
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:43.360]   ever purchased, in my case, more than 500 books is on here.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.720]   And I can listen to any book at any time, which is fantastic.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.000]   There's Damon Freedom from Daniel Suarez.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.520]   Boy, those are great books.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.840]   Oh, love those.
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.920]   The Moten God's Eye, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournell loved that.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.080]   Easy writers, raging bulls.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:59.760]   That was an Andy Inaco recommendation.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.560]   The story of Hollywood in the '70s.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.560]   Fantastic.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:03.560]   Oh, man.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.040]   I want to listen to some of these again.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.200]   So that's Audible.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.200]   Here's the deal.
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.400]   Go to Audible.com/Twit2 and you can get two books for free.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.720]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.840]   The account I have, two books a month, two credits a month.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.280]   Now some books are two credit, but 90% of the books are one credit.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.200]   And you can pick two books, but the first month's free, the first two books are free.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.200]   Cancel at any time.
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.160]   Keep those books forever.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.160]   I just love it.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.320]   What are you listening to lately, Jason?
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.880]   You got anything you could recommend?
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:37.860]   Well, I mean, the one that I recommended the last time is probably the one I want to plug
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:39.920]   again, which is among others by Joe Walton.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:40.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.920]   Fantastic.
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:42.920]   I still haven't heard of that.
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:43.920]   I got a new book.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:44.920]   I got a new book.
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:45.920]   Fantasy novel about science fiction won the Hugo Award.
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:46.920]   Great book.
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:47.920]   Fantastic book.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:48.920]   I made a mistake.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:49.920]   I forgot when you were on last time.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.920]   I didn't put it.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.920]   Whoops.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:52.920]   That's why I'm mentioning it again.
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.920]   Yes.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920]   Let me add.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.920]   Remember this time.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.920]   So watch.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920]   You can watch me buy it right now.
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920]   So you know, why am I hearing myself?
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.720]   Is it coming out of one of my devices?
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.920]   I got too many devices.
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:04.920]   I can't imagine.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:06.880]   I got too many devices.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:07.880]   So this is good.
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.920]   This is, and Catherine Calgren narrates it.
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:10.920]   It's great.
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:13.840]   It's a modern fantasy sci-fi.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.120]   Oh, look, see it says whisper sync for voice ready.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.920]   So you get the Kindle book.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   See that does that.
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.480]   See, that's awesome.
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.920]   And you can get the book for $9.99.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.600]   So you get the audio book for $3.95.
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.840]   So they reduced the price of the audio book when you buy the Kindle book.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:31.040]   Why that's just so smart.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.240]   Amazon owns Audible.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.040]   So they're tying it all together.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:36.240]   I'm going to put it right here and add it to my cart.
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:41.120]   I guess just talking to Stephen Levy, the tech writer, his classic book about the founding
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:44.640]   of the Mac, he just was recording it as an audiobook for Audible.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:45.640]   Oh, that's great.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:46.640]   That's insanely great.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:49.120]   He's an iPod book.
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.120]   The perfect thing.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.120]   The perfect thing is on there already.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.720]   Yeah, and in the Plex, I think, is Google book.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.720]   In the Plex is great.
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:55.720]   But he's now, they asked him to go back.
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:56.720]   Audible said--
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:57.720]   I'd like him to do hack.
[01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.720]   Let's bring them.
[01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.720]   Oh, that would be great.
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.720]   That's the greatest, but it's a long long--
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:01.720]   That's a great book.
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:02.720]   I don't know if Stephen will have to--
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:03.720]   He's going to need a lot of tea.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.720]   Patience.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:05.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:06.720]   Good to see you.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:07.720]   I just bought among others.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.720]   Thank you.
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:11.360]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.680]   Get your two books free right now.
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:15.480]   Listen on any of your devices.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:20.840]   If you have a Windows phone, an Android phone, or an iPhone, I highly recommend.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.200]   You don't have to have it on the iPhone because it'll just play Audible books automatically.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.000]   But it's really nice to have the app.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   It's really good.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:33.160]   Here, let me play this ad for you.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.560]   From Nestle.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.160]   This is a little creepy.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:37.160]   Let me--
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:40.240]   And the very near future, someone somewhere will purchase a chocolate bar.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.440]   The bar will be equipped with a GPS signaling device.
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:47.400]   When activated, it will beam a signal into space, bounce off a satellite, and return
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.480]   to Earth.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:52.520]   This will alert a secret control room who will scramble a crack team of highly trained
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.520]   individuals.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:58.160]   They will board a helicopter, find the special bar, and give the owner 10,000 pounds.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.720]   Then go the screen.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:05.600]   Find the special GPS bar of Kit Kat Aero or Yorkie, and we will find you with 10,000 pounds.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.280]   Is that a brilliant promotion or what?
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:08.840]   It's how Willy Wonka would do it.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.160]   It's better than a golden ticket.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.160]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.280]   I don't know how they're doing it, though.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.280]   Magic.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.760]   Seriously, that's-- I mean, what are they putting in there that's that small that could
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:19.760]   be in a candy bar that's a GPS device?
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.680]   And why do I have that as an implant yet?
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:25.320]   I think it's what if you open up here in the subway or--
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:27.800]   There are a lot of places where you might have to find it.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.800]   We will find you.
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:29.800]   Do not eat the GPS.
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:30.800]   What if you're ready to eat it?
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:33.800]   That's bad.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:35.520]   And don't throw it out.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:37.160]   Then Molly would get her implant, right?
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:38.160]   Just eat the bar.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:40.160]   Now you got an implant.
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.240]   Oh, that's an implant lowered, that's it.
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.240]   Different place.
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:46.240]   No.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.240]   It's temporary.
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:49.160]   It almost feels like a joke, but I think they're serious.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:50.720]   I think they're serious.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:53.480]   Please don't enter your codes in the wall.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.120]   If you're on a mobile, go to--
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:59.480]   They said sometime in the near future, right?
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.480]   Maybe that's a joke.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.320]   You think it's all a joke?
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:03.320]   I don't know.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.320]   I don't know.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.400]   You know, I almost want to say no because I know in the UK that--
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.400]   You can't lie.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:10.880]   You can't do advertising like that.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:13.200]   Unlike here in the US, you can say whatever you want here.
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.200]   But in the UK, you are not allowed.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:15.200]   They'll go after you.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.640]   They'll take down the ad.
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:22.080]   They've gotten mad many tech companies for misrepresenting.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.080]   MakerBot, I want to give them a plug because they're the greatest thing in the world.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:29.560]   They make those 3D printers and Brie Pettis is so cool.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:32.520]   They just open their new showroom not far from around New York.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.520]   It's in New York.
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:34.520]   Yeah.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.400]   And they have a new replicator.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.120]   They say the finest desktop 3D printer ever.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:41.000]   I'm just glad they painted the wood, finally.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.320]   That's not it.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:46.440]   I'm having trouble clicking links in the doc chat.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.840]   Is there a fix for that?
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.240]   Hey, maybe that you're clicking it wrong.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.240]   You can't.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:57.840]   It may be that you're zoomed in and Google's actually not like that.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.080]   The next generation replicator to the finest desktop, I don't know why we don't know it.
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.880]   There's Brie holding this.
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:06.280]   They painted the wood, which I think is a good idea.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.880]   Die, Lego, die.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.400]   That's all I can think when I look at those now.
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:10.880]   You can make Legos, right?
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:17.960]   I believe the middle of it, it's down to like paper thickness and how thin the extruder
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.680]   can make.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.680]   Wow.
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:24.520]   So yeah, as long as it's as thin as a sheet of paper, you can make Lego Legos.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.520]   You're going down.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:27.520]   There it is.
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:28.520]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:34.440]   Here's an article from Forbes, how a geek dad and his 3D printer aim to liberate Legos.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.720]   Oh, look, they pluralized it too.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:40.040]   The people in the chat room are pointing out Lego is supposed to be a plural, but nobody
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.040]   ever does that.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:44.600]   Only the only the to be literal.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.800]   Only the actual company name is Lego and statute always be pronounced Lego, but you
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.160]   sit down in the plural because it's a noun.
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:59.120]   I'm told by the people who know that Lego is also a plural like Lego.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.120]   My ego.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:01.120]   I've heard it.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:02.120]   I've definitely gotten that.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:09.800]   A Lego mini Lego brick as in I have some Legos Lego brand plastic building bricks.
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:10.800]   That I never would trademark.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:11.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.680]   Don't step on them.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.680]   Like a block.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.680]   So this was the solution.
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:19.520]   This guy, this is not like I was the worst pain in the world.
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.560]   And this is a mother people.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.320]   No, I've stepped on many a Lego in the middle of the night.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:29.720]   You just want to go to the bathroom and instead you've got an imprinted dots on your feet
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:32.320]   and you're curled up in the fetal.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:33.320]   Yes.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.320]   Ah.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.760]   So this guy is a professor Carnegie Mellon, go 11 and his son, who's four years old.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:45.560]   He wanted his tinker toys to attach to his connects.
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:47.840]   But they of course, that's two different toys.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:53.120]   So he created a set of digital blueprints, 45 plastic objects, which provide the missing
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:56.000]   interfaces between pieces from toy construction sets.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.240]   It's called the free universal construction kit.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.560]   And you can join anything to blow to Fisher, do blow to connects, do blow to Lincoln logs.
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:09.720]   See, if I had this as a kid, imagine the horrible monster.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:14.040]   The atrocities you would have created with your tinker toys to match to your Lego.
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.880]   Oh, man, that's brilliant.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:21.500]   And of course, this is on Thingiverse, which is a site for 3D designs that you then stick
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:24.200]   into your replicator and you're good.
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.520]   We're going to start to see some real issues around IP.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.520]   Oh, forget it.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.840]   We're already starting to.
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:34.280]   It's well, yeah, no, no problem there.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:38.280]   Google Facebook, Amazon and Yahoo are not happy with the US government.
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:41.520]   That's why they formed a new lobbying association.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.680]   Oh, good.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:46.600]   They may not be able to agree on anything, but they definitely can.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:48.240]   They can agree that the government should.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.440]   The government should butt out.
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:52.320]   Get out of our cheese.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.440]   They may be right.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.440]   I don't know.
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:06:00.440]   It would be nice that they did try to at least, you know, fix the political process.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:06.520]   I'm really disappointed that Google hasn't spent some of their money lobbying to provide
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:11.760]   a counterweight to a lot of the movie and other companies like Disney about copyright.
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.560]   But Thingiverse would be their own YouTube.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.040]   They didn't own YouTube.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.040]   They'd be no problem.
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:20.880]   You'd think that somebody like Google might finally be the company that could argue that
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:25.800]   copyright shouldn't keep getting extended every five years to get information to be free.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:27.800]   They're trying to make deals with all these companies.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.800]   Yeah, I know.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:29.800]   They're cutting on YouTube.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.800]   So they're not going to be in a play store, right?
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:32.800]   That's some way like Mr. Cutbait.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:35.760]   I mean, they have utterly failed to make those deals because of YouTube.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.200]   So they might as well be the company who says, OK, set the content free.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.200]   Yeah.
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:42.720]   I'm walking a fine line here because of CBS.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:43.720]   I know you are.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.200]   Oh, I'm not saying no copyright.
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.320]   I'm just like, could we move the copyright?
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:49.520]   Could we move public domain up to 1925?
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:50.920]   Maybe 1930.
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:53.200]   Could we actually codify fair use?
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.200]   Yeah, would that be nice?
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.240]   There is no fair use.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:58.640]   Fair use is a defense.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.640]   It's a defense.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:00.640]   Yeah.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:01.640]   That's huge.
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:02.640]   Yeah, you can use it as a defense.
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.440]   It is a it's a sort of a guideline.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.440]   It's not codified.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:09.480]   And there is no personal exemption for fair use whatsoever.
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.480]   No.
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:11.480]   So come on Google.
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:14.120]   So come on Google and they've they blog about it.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.120]   Yeah.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:16.120]   Show me the money.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:20.920]   Facebook, Google, eBay, Amazon, Zinga, Yahoo and 14 internet companies have formed the
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:26.440]   Internet Association, the unified voice of the Internet economy in Washington.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:29.760]   They'll be led by Michael Beckerman.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:33.200]   He's a Capitol Hill lobbyist.
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.760]   And in fact, he was top aid as usual.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:41.320]   He was an aid, a congressional aid at the House and Energy and Commerce Committee.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.680]   So here's here's what they say.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:52.920]   The Internet Association will relentlessly represent this critical economic sector to
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.200]   protect the freedom and innovation on the Internet.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:59.520]   One of the greatest engines for economic growth and prosperity the world has ever known.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:00.680]   They got to do it.
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:08.600]   Because we saw with the SOPA and PIPA thing that Hollywood has got Washington, D.C. wired.
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:09.600]   They spent a lot of money.
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.560]   They have a huge number of lobbyists.
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:15.120]   And the tech industry has to try to explain to a lot of senators and representatives who
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:18.040]   don't understand technology.
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:22.000]   And Hollywood did a very effective job in saying, you know, those tech people are a bunch of
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.360]   pirates and their nerds and their thieves.
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:27.680]   And we don't know what they're saying.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:30.600]   And it was really, you know, it's really bad.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:34.640]   And I hate to say it, but these big companies that have lots of money to spend, you almost
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:40.480]   have to counter the money from other industries with tech industry money to make Washington
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:41.480]   listen, which is really bad.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.480]   That's the process right now.
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:43.480]   Yeah.
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:44.480]   Yeah.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:48.000]   The thing that I wish the tech industry pointed out more is how much larger the tech industry
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.800]   is than the entertainment industry.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:51.240]   They could buy the entertainment industry.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.040]   It's just like there's crazy hippies.
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.760]   And how all of this conversation about jobs is a red herring compared to the amount of
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:02.960]   jobs that can be created by the tech industry working in concert with entertainment.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:06.680]   Everybody in the tech industry understands that content is the key to whatever they're
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:12.280]   building and that if they could somehow work together for the good of consumers, then all
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.760]   of a sudden the market triples quadruples for everyone.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:20.440]   And Google so far has been unable to make that argument because they will because Google
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.400]   honestly feels entitled to the content.
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.720]   I mean, they're kind of the wrong company, honestly, to make this argument.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:31.200]   They have unfortunately made enemies out of the industry to an extent that they aren't
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.480]   just unbelievable.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:37.760]   Sophos antivirus decided that it was a virus and deleted its binaries.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:41.400]   I missed this one.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:45.680]   Actually classified all update utilities as viruses.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:49.960]   PC's running Sophos basically just went crazy.
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:53.200]   It's like gift of the magi, right?
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:54.400]   That's an economic story.
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.400]   It is perfect.
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.800]   But I deleted myself.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:02.160]   It's an auto immune problem apparently.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:06.160]   And kind of in a related thing, Microsoft Internet Explorer zero day exploit.
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.440]   Fortunately, Microsoft was able to release a patch out of cycle patch within a couple
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:12.440]   of days.
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.760]   So, but unfortunately before then many, many people I'm sure got infected by using Internet
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.560]   Explorer.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.240]   Friends don't let friends use IE.
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:23.240]   I just got to say.
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:26.840]   I'm so sorry to tell you I have to go.
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.840]   It's all right.
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:28.840]   We're done.
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:29.840]   It's perfect timing.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:31.480]   I know it's like I need to get my baby.
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:32.960]   Yeah, go get your baby.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:40.080]   Molly Wood always on at cnet.com/alwayson great show must watch.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.640]   And you stole my producer, but I'm not going to hold that against you.
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:46.200]   It's only because you let the world know how awesome she was.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:47.200]   She's really great.
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.080]   She's never fun doing the show because it's a she didn't jump out of an airplane to did
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:52.080]   she?
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:53.080]   I'm late.
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:54.080]   She would not shoot.
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:55.080]   She would not.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.760]   She said, no, I will be no.
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.760]   Too scary.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:58.760]   I won't do it.
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:01.560]   What your next torture test is to take an iPhone five and drag it against across the
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:02.560]   concrete.
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:07.440]   Well, so the iPhone so we have the whole battery of torture tests which are drop heat, cold
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:08.440]   and water.
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.840]   So it'll go through all of those and then the wild card, which will probably be some
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:15.240]   form of dragging to try to scratch it on the back.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.160]   Tie it to the back of a horse.
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:19.960]   It's a pretty messed up job.
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:20.960]   Somebody got to do it.
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:21.960]   Great Molly.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:22.960]   Who's going to the back of a horse is awesome.
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:24.640]   Yeah, drag it.
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:30.360]   I was thinking car, but horses so much more terrific.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:31.360]   It's great to have you.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:32.360]   Great to see you, Molly.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.600]   Come up and visit us sometime.
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:36.280]   Next time I will come to the studio for sure.
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:37.280]   It's fine.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:38.480]   I just anyway you come is great.
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:40.240]   We like just like having you on the show.
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:41.640]   Appreciate it.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:43.040]   Thank you to Peter Rojas.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.240]   It's great to be here in person.
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.400]   I'm so glad that Veronica and Ryan got married so that we could see you.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.440]   Yeah, no, actually, Angie, I insisted they get married so I had an excuse to come back
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:53.440]   for the show.
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:54.440]   Perfect.
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:55.440]   Perfect.
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:56.440]   It worked out really well for me.
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:57.440]   Nice to have you.
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.440]   Peter, of course, is at GDGT.com.
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:58.800]   You have an event coming up soon?
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.440]   We are going to be in Boston on October 17th in San Francisco, December 6th.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.840]   Those are must see events.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:05.840]   They're really great.
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:06.840]   They're really great.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:11.320]   And we're going to be releasing our score, Metascore for the iPhone 5 tomorrow.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:14.520]   Ah, how many reviews do you compile?
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.480]   As many as we can find.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:19.960]   And I think we have about 20 editorial reviews so far.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:22.520]   And yeah, we'll be scoring it tomorrow given it a...
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:25.840]   I mean, I know what the score is already, but we're not supposed to say until tomorrow.
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:26.840]   Secret.
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:28.280]   It's a secret.
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:31.200]   And do go to those events and you know what will be fun about those events, the Galaxy
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:32.920]   Note 2 will be out by then.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.880]   Probably the Windows phone will be out by then.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:35.880]   There's going to be a ton of stuff.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:36.880]   Especially for the sales.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:37.880]   Especially for the sales.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.880]   Yeah, there's going to be tons and tons of great stuff.
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:39.880]   Good.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:40.880]   I'll have to be at that one.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.880]   Great, Peter.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:42.880]   Nice to see you.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.880]   Thank you.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.800]   Thanks to Jason Stell lives just down the road, but we got to get you up more often.
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:47.800]   I didn't realize you'd never been on the big show.
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:49.720]   Well, you're going to be back because you're great.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.720]   I love having fun.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:51.720]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:53.360]   Congratulations on your new job at IDG.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:55.360]   And really, congratulations on TechHive.
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.840]   This is a nice looking site.
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:57.840]   Thanks.
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:58.840]   Yeah, TechHive.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.840]   And we relaunched Macworld and PCworld.
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.440]   Oh, you got a new site for them too?
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:02.440]   Yeah.
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:03.760]   They're all sort of based on the same base template.
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:04.760]   This is really nice.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:05.760]   And it's...
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.840]   Yeah, it's a lot of work, but I'm hoping that good things are going to come back.
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:13.240]   If I were one of them other gadget blogs, like say the Verge, I'd be a little bit...
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.360]   Well, we're trying to be a little more about product reviews and how-tos and not trying
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.360]   to replicate the Verge.
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:20.920]   We love the Verge and Engadget and Gizmodo, and we don't think the world needs another
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:21.920]   one of those.
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:23.480]   Okay, so it's a little different.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:25.000]   And you're focusing on reviews in this.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.440]   Yeah, reviews and how-tos and some news analysis stuff, but we're not going to try to be another
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:31.960]   Tech News blog because there are plenty of those two.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:32.960]   They're plenty of those two.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   I do like the how-tos.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.800]   I think that's something we all need more of.
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:36.800]   Yeah.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:39.080]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:40.080]   Thanks.
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.280]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon about 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.080]   That's 2,200 UTC.
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:49.200]   And we appreciate it when you stop by live, as you can see, the chatroom is a big part
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:50.200]   of the show.
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:51.520]   But if you can't do that, don't worry.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:57.600]   We make on-demand versions available, audio, video, and HD video at Twit.tv, so you can
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.840]   download it after the fact.

[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:06.280]   That way you'll get it every week without even thinking about it.
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:07.600]   Thanks, everybody, for being here.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:08.600]   We'll see you next week.
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:10.160]   Another Twit is in the game.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.160]   Thank you.
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.160]   Thank you.
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:13.160]   Alright.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.160]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:15.160]   Do the Twit.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:16.160]   Alright.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.160]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.160]   Do the Twit.
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.160]   Alright.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:20.160]   Alright.
