[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.360]   With a panel hand-assembled, carefully crafted panel of tech journalists, three of the best
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.200]   with me today via Skype from New Mexico.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.400]   Ed Bot of ZDNet joins us.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.800]   Great to see you, Ed.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.360]   It is a pleasure to be here, Leo.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.960]   And I see over your right shoulder, your left shoulder, my right, the Bob Dylan poster
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   to celebrate his no-belitude.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.960]   Nice.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:44.160]   Yeah, you got to give him props for that speech that he wrote this week.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   It was amazing.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   Rope didn't read.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.360]   I think the ambassador to Sweden ended up reading it.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.080]   And Patty Smith performed.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.000]   But he did not go to the...
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.240]   Now apparently, though, he has to give a lecture if he wants the $800,000.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.280]   So here's my question.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.760]   How much...
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.840]   So clearly, Bob Dylan's too cool for school and he's not going to go.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.920]   That's why he didn't go.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.680]   But here's a question.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.000]   $800,000.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.360]   Do you give the lecture?
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.520]   I think if you go to Google and type in Bob Dylan net worth, you realize that...
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520]   He doesn't need to.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.160]   You know, $800,000 would be nice, but he doesn't need it.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.520]   I love it.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.720]   Also with us from Gizmodo, she's a senior editor there.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.960]   It's great to have film girl, Christina Warren.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.440]   Hey, great to be here.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.240]   Nice to see you with your Apple TV in the background.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   Yes.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.760]   Apologies for the lighting in this room.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   This is the best I could do.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.120]   It's got a dark a lot earlier.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.040]   I know, I know.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   Well, you know, in a way, it's better because what it used to be is you'd start all lit
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   and then the sun would...
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   Right.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   It would get black.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   So this is good.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   You're prepared.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.240]   Devendra Hardawar is also here joining us.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.240]   I think you're in New York, right from Engadget.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   I'm in New York, yeah.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   Engadget.com.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   Manhattan or Brooklyn?
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.040]   I understand there's a difference.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   I can't afford Manhattan.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   I can.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   Who can?
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   You're in Brooklyn now anyway.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   You're in Brooklyn too, right?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   Christina?
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   I am in Brooklyn.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   Yes.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   It's all crazy now.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.440]   That was a great YouTube video.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   Settlers of Brooklyn.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.840]   Did you see that?
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   Yes.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   I think so.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   It's, you know, there's a great game Settlers of Catan and a lot of people play it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.240]   Well, this is a bunch of Hitler's hip hipsters.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   Sorry.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   Not Hitler's.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.240]   Wow.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.640]   A bunch of hipsters sitting around playing the award winning game of entitlement.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   Self discovery and hipster, hipster-tude.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.240]   Oh man.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.480]   Somebody put a lot of effort into this.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.280]   Which pizza parlor do you frequent, Devinda?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   I have a couple I really like.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.320]   I understand that's one way to distinguish Brooklynites.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   There are.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.040]   In my neighborhood right below me, there is one called Defaris, which has been around.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.680]   It's like an 80 year old guy who's been doing it forever.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.280]   He's just their hand rolling the pizza every day.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   Perfect.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   You're not selling Johnny come lately.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.680]   You are a real deal.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.360]   That's the place where like he won't even let his son roll the dough, right?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.920]   Like, just so he can help us humble.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.680]   But he's still not allowed to like roll.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.880]   But yeah, he's still the one.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   It's the jureo dreams of sushi of pizza.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   Oh, really?
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   Like the basil.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.800]   The basil comes from like Israel or something.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   It's all fresh.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   It's all like special ingredients.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.200]   And you go there and you wait maybe an hour or two for a pizza.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   That's great.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.440]   I've got to come out and go.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   That sounds wonderful.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   Mm hmm.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   All right.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.960]   Let's where should we kick off this show today?
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.120]   Was there a big story this week?
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.520]   I think the funniest story is Samsung saying in a few days on December 19th, they're going
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.880]   to send an update to note sevens that will basically turn them into bricks.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.200]   You won't be able to use a note seven unless it's plugged in.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.640]   They're effectively rendering it useless.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.760]   But the funny part is when Verizon said, yeah, we're not going to do that upgrade.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.640]   First of all, how many note sevens are still out there?
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.360]   They say that 93% have been turned in.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.320]   So this is in the United States.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.440]   And so I think that in the US, they sold about two million.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.240]   So whatever 93% of two million is.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.240]   It's $140,000.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.240]   That's a lot.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   I guess, totally.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   It's, I mean, it's not non-trivial.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.280]   I don't know how many of those are on the Verizon network.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.600]   I think it's probably a better question.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   And I have to say, I haven't seen a lot of reports of Galaxy Notes bursting into flames.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.160]   So maybe these are the ones that are okay?
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.240]   I mean, I don't think you can say that.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.400]   I mean, I think that clearly Samsung doesn't believe it.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   Right.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.680]   Well, neither does the consumer safety product commission.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.760]   And neither do any of the other agencies around the world.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.280]   So they definitely want everybody to turn them in.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.760]   And that's why they want to issue this update.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.480]   I think it's interesting that Verizon won't do it.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.880]   And they claim that it's because of the holiday season.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.320]   Let me read the quote.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   Yeah, sure.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.840]   Because, yeah, that's what they're saying.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.160]   And I think that's funny because they call it a software upgrade.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.600]   I, yeah, not an upgrade.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.560]   We will not push, says Verizon, a software upgrade that will eliminate the ability for
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.080]   the Note 7 to work as a mobile device in the heart of the holiday travel season.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.320]   We do not want to make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.720]   in an emergency situation.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   That's reasonable.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.800]   Although Samsung said we would prefer that people's houses don't burn down during the
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.040]   holiday season too.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.200]   Well, and in the federal aviation administration has said we would prefer we're actually going
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.480]   to insist that these not be taken on airplanes.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.080]   So holiday travel season, unless you're in an airplane, in which case every major airline
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.880]   will tell you before you get on board, you're not allowed to have it.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.440]   And if you do have it, you need to put it in a special, you know, flammable proof bag
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.640]   that has to be in your line of sight at all times and, you know, then dispose of it.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.160]   So I don't know.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.280]   John Gruber had kind of an interesting aside on this.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.120]   He said, you know, why didn't Verizon push for them to do this sooner?
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.880]   I, you know, I think that's probably fair.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.440]   They definitely they pushed out some similar breaking updates in other countries.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.120]   I think I don't think it's okay that Verizon is doing this, to be honest.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.600]   I think that whatever, whatever opinion you have over a company taking this course of
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   action to brick a phone, and I certainly understand the point of view, which is to say, I bought
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   this device.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.480]   I'm the one who takes the risk.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   When it does become a safety issue, I understand making the decision to to brick the phone.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.560]   But although I get the broader concerns with what I bought, I didn't really buy.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.520]   But I don't really like a carrier stepping in and taking the unilateral position of usurping
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.360]   what the company wanted.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.320]   Because if they're doing it in this case, they're basically, Verizon is basically claiming
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.480]   that for their on their network, they're more important.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   Well, they may not want to get sued by somebody who's having a heart attack and couldn't call
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.000]   911 because their phone would work.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Well, but I mean, they've given them many, many opportunities to return the phone.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.960]   Stacey Higginbotham's parents still were using note sevens until like last week.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.600]   And they finally stopped because they said, "You can't make a call.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   You can't do anything.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.880]   Every time you do anything on the phone, there's a pop up saying, 'Please turn this phone in.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   Please, please, please, please."
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   Right.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.600]   So, I mean, I think part of it comes down to has Verizon done a good enough job of getting
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   people in themselves.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   I mean, I know that in Australia, Samsung, New Zealand, and Samsung, Australia, we're
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.480]   issuing, we're sending out updates very, very quickly and we're getting all the carriers
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   on board to constantly send notifications.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.720]   So, pardon me, wonders, is, was Verizon not really doing enough to get people to turn their
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.600]   phones in and making it as easy as possible to turn your phone in?
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.080]   I know that early on with the first recall, not the second complete recall, it was a nightmare
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.200]   for customers to even exchange their phone.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.560]   And so, you could understand why people wouldn't want to go through the hassle.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.600]   But at this point, I mean, it's not just a safety concern.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   It's a safety concern.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.400]   I kind of don't like the idea of a carrier saying, "In any situation, we're going to
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.720]   unilaterally refuse to allow, you know, we're going to be the gatekeepers to decide what
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.200]   can and can't be issued to your phone because if they could do it in this instance, we also
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.320]   see them do this in instances of software updates that need to be issued, you know, like Apple's
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:33.000]   the only company and Google through, you know, well, I guess through the Pixel, but,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.200]   you know, historically through the Nexus line who could kind of bypass the carriers.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.240]   And you see certain phones that are sold like the blue phones that had malware on them and
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.680]   carriers, you know, they'll issue out an update, but then the carriers won't let the updates
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   through.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.120]   And so, I just don't like a carrier ever stepping in and saying, "We're not going to
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.160]   issue an update to this phone for whatever reason."
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.000]   I don't like the precedent that sets.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.920]   But this is what Verizon has always done.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.000]   This has been their, their modus operandi on every phone.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.600]   It's one reason why I stopped.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.280]   Verizon is the only US carrier that I can use because here in my office, it's the only
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.240]   one where I get a decent signal.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.000]   And they would not issue updates for the Windows phone that I owned.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.240]   I mean, six or nine months after Microsoft had released it, they were still refusing
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.720]   to issue a major update that the phone desperately needed.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.880]   And I finally just threw up my hands.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.920]   They've done that with Android phones as well.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   Take it out.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.400]   Yeah, for not a good month.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.520]   For no good reason.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.120]   For no good reason whatsoever.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.800]   To go back to something that you said, Leo, I wanted to pile on a little bit there.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.360]   You know, you said maybe these are the safe phones that are out there.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.160]   I read an interesting analysis of the problem with the Note 7 the other day.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:08.640]   There was a group of material analysts that had done some micro photography of the phone.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.240]   And they had basically determined that Samsung in their desire to make a phone that was as
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:21.480]   thin as possible had basically not left any expansion room for the battery in the case.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.480]   And all batteries expand.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.160]   You know, it's only it's only a micron or two or three, but you have to leave some expansion
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   room.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.240]   So what that means if their analysis was correct is that this was eventually going to happen
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.880]   to every phone.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.880]   All of them.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.680]   And that the first phones that they discovered this flaw in were just they were they were
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.080]   the canaries in the coal mine.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.400]   But you know, this was going to happen more and more often and probably increasingly,
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   you know, as you hit the one year mark and you know, you really started feeling the heat
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.680]   on these battery packs.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:09.480]   So you know, just a just a terrible, you know, I just can't imagine that Samsung's brand
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.080]   is going to remain.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.640]   You know, he's not going to suffer major damage from this event.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.440]   Does Samsung ever say why?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.640]   They haven't they haven't figured it out from the last.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.160]   They don't know.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.960]   Yeah, there's the whole thing early on where they like spend some time researching it and
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.320]   yeah, they didn't give it a figure that out.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.800]   Although I wonder if this is going to be a warning sign to all manufacturers where,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.400]   you know, maybe we should stop making phones as thin as possible.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.360]   And maybe we should look at other things because when you take that together with something
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.080]   like fast charging, which Samsung has also been pushing thanks to their chips, anything
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.440]   some Qualcomm chips do that too.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:56.560]   You know, that's a lot of power happening very quickly in a really tight environment.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.640]   And that could be a problem.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.200]   The last thing I'm looking at, this is tech times from September.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.840]   Samsung says, at least in the Chinese phones, because remember at first they said, oh, well,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.880]   you don't have to worry about the phones in China because they use different battery.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.280]   And then there were fires.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.120]   And they said, well, that was from external heating, not the battery.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.200]   But I think it confirms kind of Ed, your supposition that it's just there's no room for expansion.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Right.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.280]   And the bad everything that warms up gets bigger.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.760]   And not right.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.680]   I think that's FUD's third law of opposition.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.200]   FUD's third law of opposition, whatever goes up must explode.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:48.240]   Well, anyway, 133,000 to 140,000 people still have note sevens December 19th, unless you're
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.680]   ever rise in which case you're good.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   Just keep using it.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   Why not?
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.280]   Now you guys, when you flew out from Milwaukee, did they tell you did the air?
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   The airline say don't do they announce no note sevens?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.680]   They did say it because I talked to somebody yesterday said when we flew out, they didn't
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.840]   say anything.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.480]   So some airlines have thrown up their heads.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.800]   I was on at least a half a dozen flights last week.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.880]   We did a nice vacation and there were at least six flights involved.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:25.480]   And on every single one, there were extended safety advisories about the note seven.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.320]   And they didn't say anything about putting it in a bag or anything.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   What they said is, if you have one, you have to alert the cabin crew.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.400]   And you can't turn it on.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.520]   And it must be out where we can see it at all times.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   But every single one had a full speech that they gave on it.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.600]   And as you say, this has got to be bad for the brand all around.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Can't imagine.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.840]   Now we're hearing rumors that I don't think it's a rumor.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.840]   I think I'm sure it's true.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.080]   Samsung will announce the S8 in March at Mobile World Congress.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   Right to Vindra?
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.720]   I mean, I assume so.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.880]   That's when they normally do it.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.920]   I mean, they've had like several of it.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.520]   They've had separate events too, right?
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520]   So that's the thing.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.960]   Mobile World Congress hasn't been the sort of big phone announcement event for a very
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.960]   long time.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   But I don't know.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.840]   Maybe they'll need some of that partner help this year.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.040]   And will they ever do another note?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   Can't imagine.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.520]   I think they have to kill the note name.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.920]   I think it has to be on.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.240]   I think you have a product that is exactly the same as the note in every single way.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   But it has the pin.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   It has the open.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   It has everything.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.240]   Huge success.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   Call it a note.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   Sure.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.920]   I mean, first the note, the original note, everybody laughed at me when I got it.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.000]   And then by three years or four years later, everybody had a five inch, six inch phone.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Everybody.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Sure.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.200]   Well, they also got smaller too.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.800]   So it wasn't the screen size.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.600]   They, the actual physical form factor.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.160]   Screen's got bigger and bigger, but the bezels got shorter and smaller.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   And so the phone got smaller.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.760]   In fact, the, that was one of the things that was great about the note seven is it was
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.880]   smaller than an iPhone seven.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   Feels great.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.360]   With a bigger square, the five point seven inch screen, a bigger screen.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.560]   I noticed that too about the Pixel XL.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.000]   It just feels really good in your hand, especially compared to like the iPhone six plus or the
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.200]   seven plus like those things way too big for me.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.360]   Well, I mean, I feel bad for Samsung.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.120]   I think Samsung's doing everything they can.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.000]   I just, it's so ironic that Verizon is going and not so fast.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.080]   And for, I think of the liability, if one of these phones, the Verizon phones does have
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   a fire cause a problem.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.480]   It does seem like interesting about this.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   They're putting themselves on a fire.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.080]   It sounds like this may be partially like a lawyer decision to like maybe they did the
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.360]   math and like we're figuring the circumstances of somebody not having access to their phones
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.320]   versus it is a small chance of a fire, but it's, it's, you know, it's still a chance
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   of a fire.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   So I didn't know.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.120]   I feel like I can't say too much before the Verizon snipers getting me.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.360]   So because technically I work for Verizon.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   Right.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   That's right.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   That's right.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   Verizon owns you.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.680]   I got to watch out guys.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   It's so confusing.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.000]   Verizon owns you.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.440]   Samsung owns no, Samsung doesn't own Christina.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.440]   Who owns Christina?
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   No, no, no.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   Univision.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   Univision.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   And Ed bot, no one knows who owns ZD net.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   It's confusing.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.080]   It's, it's CBS interactive.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   Okay.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.880]   Which is in turn a Sumner Redstone.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.680]   Basically it's some Sumner Redstone.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.160]   We can make some Emperor Palpatine jokes here.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.760]   I don't think he's actively involved anymore.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   Is he?
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.280]   He's 93 years old.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   Emperor Palpatine.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   Yes.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.280]   He's not 130 years old.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.840]   Yeah, because the family apparently he's kind of noncompass medicine at this point.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.920]   The family's trying to take the, take the money and run.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.280]   Inside the, here it is from Vanity Fair, of course.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.040]   But this is last March or April.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.880]   Inside the raging legal battle over Sumner Redstone's final days.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.800]   I think he's still alive.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.560]   Yeah, yes.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   Yep.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.160]   Anyway, I don't know how we got into that.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160]   Media's weird.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   Media's weird.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.080]   I can agree with you on that.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.640]   It all started with Verizon.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:25.440]   And then of course we've got Verizon is currently on the hook to buy Yahoo.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.960]   Yeah, what's the story there?
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.400]   We have heard nothing.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.240]   I think after the whole big Yahoo hack, Verizon's like, "Hey guys, you didn't tell us about this."
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.400]   They asked for, they said, "Well, that should take a billion off right off the top."
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   Totally.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   Right?
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Probably should.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.760]   At our offices here in New York, we have a, there are a bunch of We Love Yahoo signs
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760]   around.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.400]   I wonder if they still love Yahoo.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   I don't know.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.840]   And have we heard anything about Marissa Meyer?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.000]   I mean, is what's going on?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.440]   I mean, she's still there.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.720]   Well, she's always said she was going to stay through the transition.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.560]   And then I think we all assume that as soon as the sale was complete, that she would obviously
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.160]   leave because I don't think there's any way that she would work with Tim Armstrong or
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   work under Tim Armstrong.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   No.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   I just see that happens.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.160]   She's got a fairly, I think a fairly hefty.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.400]   Oh, a very nice golden parachute.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.200]   Several package.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   Very nice.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:32.840]   I saw a picture, Marissa, at some society event looking very content, not looking at all nervous
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.400]   about it in the future.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.840]   All right.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:42.960]   That's the, I thought I'd start off with something light and chewable, a little, you
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:49.000]   know, a little, a parateafe before we dig into the somewhat more challenging content.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.680]   For instance, a big tech summit on Wednesday, President-elect Trump is bringing in the big
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   guns.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:04.600]   Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Facebook, CEO of Sheryl Sandberg,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.080]   and Zuck is not going.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.680]   We'll be attending the tech summit, perhaps even according to Rico, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   Although Bezos, one of the people Mr. Trump doesn't like too much because he owns the
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.440]   Washington Post.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.680]   Satya Nadella will be there from Microsoft, Chuck Robbins from Cisco.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.840]   Of course, Jeannie will be the, Jeannie Rometty of IBM.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.640]   She already has stepped up to volunteer to help in any way with any databases that the
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.880]   president would like to create of any kind.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.680]   Brian Krask, who's an inch of Intel and Safra Katz, who is apparently the CEO of Oracle.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   Although you don't hear a lot about it.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   Co-CEO.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   She's the co-CEO.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.640]   Co-CEO, because that other guy probably is...
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.640]   Mark Hart.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.480]   And that was, and that was quite the quote from her today also.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480]   Yeah, it was.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   What did he say?
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.280]   Should I, can I find it?
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.840]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.240]   It was, it's basically, you know, we will provide, we are here to assist in any way possible
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.040]   with any of your database needs.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.280]   I mean, it was basically, it was basically the joke that you just made only for real.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.280]   Wow.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   Wow.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:24.760]   Well, no, but that's what IBM, Jeannie Rometty's famous open letter to the Trump administration.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.160]   IBM is here to help.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.200]   Which given IBM's past database help?
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   As they have in the past.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   Exactly.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   Exactly.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   They have.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.600]   We know how to make...
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   Let's not do this.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   Great.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.920]   If you have a hundred billion dollar market cap or higher, you should have been invited.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.280]   Apparently, that's, according to Gabrivera, that's the, that seems to be the thing.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   Right.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.280]   In common.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.320]   He tweeted, "Based on the invitees named here appears public US tech companies with a market
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.920]   cap greater than a hundred billion were invited."
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.720]   Well, I'm excited.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   I said Brian Shinsky, who from Airbnb was invited.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.640]   They certainly don't have that market cap.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.880]   But I think that they, he's not able to come according to Cara Swisher because he'll be
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   out of town.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   But I think that it is kind of a plot.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   That's convenient.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   Oh, golly.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   I was, I'm going to Palm Springs.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   We'll say, I am so sorry.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.360]   They would say Travis Callen, I feel both be out of the country.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.840]   And I don't know what Uber's, you know, valuation is.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.000]   They're certainly not, since they're not public.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.440]   But Airbnb certainly isn't anywhere close to a hundred billion.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.040]   But I think because Peter Thiel found respond as a big investor in them, that might have
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   been part of it.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.280]   Thiel has become of course an advisor to the transition team.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.600]   But you know, the president calls, you know, you go, right?
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.280]   I mean, that's pretty, pretty traditional.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.680]   Well, I mean, I think that what some people were saying in, in Rico's report, in Cara
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.440]   Swisher's reporting, and this is true, is that they, they went for Obama and, and they
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.040]   went, you know, for past presidents.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   So even if you disagree and even you go, you know, the president elect asks, you go.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:11.840]   And so even though a lot of these CEOs have publicly supported positions and people that
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.120]   are completely opposite Trump, you know, you're invited, you go.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.080]   And even though, you know, Trump has had, you know, battles and has threatened, you know,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.000]   boycotts for companies like Apple.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.680]   Yeah, you, you show up.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.480]   Fire Tim Cook, I might be a little nervous that that might, I might be singled out, you
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   know.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.280]   Well, yeah, I mean, especially since we know what happened when he had this similar meeting
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.080]   like this with the media, you know, when he met with CNN and, and, and, and, and,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.720]   New York Times, New York Times, shoot about the New York Times when it was on the record,
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.000]   but the one that was off the record where all the anchors went.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.240]   And the executives and you told Jeff sucker how terrible CNN was and you people were
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.640]   biased against me.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.840]   So you do kind of wonder, like, is he going to, you know, is this going to be another one
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.680]   of these meetings where it starts out with Trump airing the area of the grievances,
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.040]   you know, how do you do it?
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.800]   It's almost best of us.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:07.200]   So, you know, bring, bring your aluminum poles kids and bring your aluminum pole and
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.880]   and we will, although I think it's going to be a one way airing of grievances, at least
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   for the next week.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.480]   You know, if I were one of these CEOs, I'd be very curious.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.760]   I'd love to hear what President Trump has to say.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.280]   I mean, in many ways, he's pro business, certainly his cabinet is full of generals and businessmen.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.680]   I could see people, at least wanting to be there to help stop him in a way or at least
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.240]   he's having a sort of, what is your opportunity there to stop anything?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.160]   I mean, I think you're there to hear, to hear what they're seeing, how the actual situation
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.440]   is working behind the scenes because Trump is so secretive and doesn't really, you know,
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.440]   he hasn't talked to press normally and there is enough of that access.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.120]   You know, you can see his reality show roots because he really does seem to be running
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.280]   this like a reality show.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.240]   You almost expect cameras outside and then, you know, Tim Cook going, "Well, I hope he
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   likes me.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.640]   I don't want to be kicked off the island."
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.880]   I mean, it just almost feels like that a little bit like somebody, somebody, 10 will enter,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.240]   but only nine will come out kind of a thing.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   Ouch.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   We'll see.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   I don't know.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:21.440]   There is, however, a fairly well established dynamic in the way that Trump operates.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:28.280]   You know, multiple people have commented on this, which is that his decisions tend to
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.080]   be heavily influenced by the last person that he talked to.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.320]   So you want to get his ear.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   You want to get in there.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.840]   So you want to be in the room and you want to make sure that if you have a thing that
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.000]   you want to have happen, then the room where it happens.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.640]   That you say that out loud and you make your case and hope that that earworm gets planted.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.080]   And tackle everybody else after you, so that's all.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:03.160]   The other tech story having to do with the election and the president-elect, by the way,
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.800]   the CIA and the FBI seem to disagree on this, but the CIA has apparently said that it believed
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.960]   Russia was trying to help Donald Trump win the White House.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.240]   And their evidence for this is that they now are concluded and the intelligence community
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.720]   seems to mostly agree that the Russian government hacked both the Democratic National Committee
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.400]   and the Republican National Committee, but only released the emails of the Democratic
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   National Committee.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.000]   The president has now asked for a full investigation and a report before he leaves office on January
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   19th.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.720]   I don't know what to say.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.560]   I mean, it's clear that there's hacking on both sides.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.760]   We hack them, they hack us.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.520]   What would it mean if foreign government attempted to influence American elections?
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.400]   And what do you do about that if they do?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.320]   I mean, I see a lot of people like Marmalie pointing out, "Oh, the American government's
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.200]   done this forever in other countries and we deserve this."
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.080]   Certainly a thrown election to the past.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.520]   The CIA, in fact, has thrown elections in the past.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.760]   But I think we can separate that issue with this one, which is that, "Oh my God, the country
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.880]   is on fire and yeah, we get to do something about it."
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   There are one former CIA director said, "If you find out this is the case, you have to
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.280]   read, you have to do a do-over."
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   Right.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.520]   I don't think we're getting a do-over.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.520]   No.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520]   No.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   In fact, I don't even know what the...
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   I mean, I guess...
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.520]   We don't know what to do.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   That's the thing.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.200]   A lot of people have been asking, "So, okay, the CIA says Russia has basically pushed our
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.400]   election."
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.160]   And Trump, like, we know he has had close ties to Putin.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.720]   He spent a lot of time defending Putin.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.240]   So where do we go from here?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.400]   We don't have the mechanisms to do anything really.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   There's no precedent.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400]   It's disturbing.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   There's no precedent.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.720]   Like short of the electors refusing to actually elect him in.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.480]   Right before the election, I remember Biden going on the morning shows and saying, "Just
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:11.640]   basically threatening, if you guys mess with our elections, we have tools in place for
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.080]   a commensurate response."
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.680]   At a time in place of our choosing.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.280]   At a time we won't tell you what we're going to do, but it will match the impact you had
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.960]   on us.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.200]   That seemed to be almost a hollow threat, but it was clearly a threat.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.840]   Don't mess with our elections.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Hacking is going to...
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.320]   This will be 2017 is going to be very interesting here for a hack.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.960]   I've been saying that for five every year, every December for five years now.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   There is a few...
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.840]   You guys see the Alex Gibney movie, "Zero Days"?
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.840]   Yes.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   The one about the suction.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   That's a great film.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.560]   It makes a lot of great points that...
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.000]   I think he almost predicted that we'd be seeing more and more of this.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.560]   Who knew it was going to happen so quickly?
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   It's a safe and easy prediction.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:04.020]   He was talking about our hacking, or maybe the Israeli hacking, certainly governmental
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:10.120]   hacking of the Iranian centrifuges using the Stuxnet virus to attempt to prevent them from
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.680]   creating an atomic bomb.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.760]   Which by the way, as surgical strikes go, is a good idea.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   Unfortunately.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.360]   Exploded all over the internet.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.440]   They didn't design it well enough and we all got it.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.480]   It's pretty insane.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.120]   The bigger takeaway from that movie for me was the idea that we can all get together internationally
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.800]   and say there has to be an international conversation about these cyber tools.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.160]   A Geneva accord, if you will, of what we're seeing.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   Or something.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.200]   We live in interesting times.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.720]   This is former CIA director Michael Hayden.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.680]   This is the trailer for Zero Days.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.640]   Which if you haven't seen, I think it's on Netflix for free.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.520]   It becomes a challenge for all of us to maintain some accountability and control of our critical
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   infrastructure.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520]   Highly recommend.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.080]   It's actually a little terrifying.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   Frankly.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   Okay.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.880]   We need to be scared.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.840]   Well, this is what's going on.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.080]   Nobody is gainsaying this.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   This is as far as I know, 100% accurate.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.680]   Power created and pump gas.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   Transportation.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:28.360]   It is ironic, isn't it, that the agency that we created to and has actively overthrown
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:36.840]   other governments for years is now calling foul on the Russian government.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.520]   And the course of Trump team says no, that didn't happen.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.560]   Well they didn't just deny it.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:50.160]   The press release that they, the three sentence press release, each one of those three sentences
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.920]   was in fact not true.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.880]   So it was three sentences, three lies.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.760]   But more importantly, normally we have institutions in this country.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.160]   And you may disagree with the work of the institutions, but the intelligence community
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.200]   is composed of professionals.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   And what Trump and his people are basically saying is that they disagree with all of the
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.640]   output from the intelligence community, from community.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.600]   And now his people were saying today, well, we're just going to put our own people in.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.280]   And that to me is actually the more frightening thing.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:41.040]   It takes a long time to build up both the defensive, especially the defensive capabilities
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.920]   for this kind of thing.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:53.400]   And if the new guy comes in here and upsets the game board, just throws it up in the air,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.520]   that has the potential for very, very serious consequences.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.920]   The press release said, I can read it in its entirety.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.000]   These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.680]   >> That's not true.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.280]   >> The monsterly false.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.360]   The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.680]   history.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.480]   >> That's actually two lies in one sentence because it was only four weeks ago.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.080]   And it was the 46th.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.440]   >> That is 58.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:34.360]   The 46th largest out of 58, so it's sort of the opposite of a landslide.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.680]   >> And statement three, which actually you could debate whether this is true or not.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.240]   It's now time to move on and make America great again.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:50.920]   >> Well I think anybody who looks at this, if you see that 17 agencies in the US intelligence
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:59.560]   community basically agree that there was some kind of activity by the Russian government.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:06.040]   Even if you disagree on the scope of that and the impact of that, it's not time to move
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   on.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   It's time to investigate it.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:17.000]   And even if you benefited from it, in a normal election, after a normal election result,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.720]   the winning candidate would say, I agree completely with this.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.320]   We should have a full investigation.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.760]   >> No, I don't think that the winner writes the history, right?
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.640]   So I think that this goes away on January 20th.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   >> But they would control the investigation and so they would go then.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   >> Oh, I see.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.520]   >> Of course, we're going to set up an investigation because that's what you do.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.720]   And then you have a rubber stamp of an investigation.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.520]   >> And you can just bury it.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.400]   >> And you're going to go on and nobody comes up.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:49.320]   By saying vehemently as Trump has done, this is not true.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.920]   How does he know that?
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.480]   How does he know this is not true?
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:59.720]   When thousands of analysts you know have been working on this with the men.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.800]   >> And we should point out, isn't unanimous a senior US official said there were minor,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.000]   this is according to the post, there are minor disagreements among intelligence officials
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.280]   about the CIA's assessment, in part become because some questions remain unanswered.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   >> Sure.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   >> Sure.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.320]   >> So they, for instance, don't off the Kremlin directed this.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:29.200]   >> Yeah, but when the guy says this is not true and he's only participating in even one
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.760]   out of six intelligence briefing, who is telling him that this is not true?
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.400]   The same people who told him that there were 3 million illegal aliens who voted in the
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   election.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.760]   >> The question is, is it not true because it's not true or because you don't want it
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.720]   to be true?
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   But this probably explains why Obama said, well, let's have an investigation now and
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.680]   you're going to have to report to me in the next few weeks because I'm going to be out
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.720]   of here on January 19th.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.280]   >> And so are many of you probably.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   >> And so are many of you.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280]   >> And so are many of you.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   >> The intelligence community.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   >> Now that's the risk.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   >> So, okay.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   So let's ask the next two questions.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:11.120]   What do you do if they come back and say, yeah, no, it's true.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.760]   I mean, I don't know what they're going to do that's different.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.360]   They've already said it's true.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   What are you going to do?
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.280]   How do you, what's the, what's the response to that?
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.080]   You can't fix it.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.480]   As you say to Vendrick, we're in a situation where we have no.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   >> This is uncharted territory.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.640]   >> President, no respect.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   What is the response?
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.560]   You can't do the election over.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.360]   >> I mean, you could.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.680]   >> This is something that the founding fathers do not anticipate.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.560]   >> I mean, either it's all up to the electors or I don't know, like I could see some sort
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560]   of other type of.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.600]   >> The electors vote in five days or whatever.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.880]   It's the 19th.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:52.360]   So I don't think that, and I also think, you know, a number of states have said and have
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:57.920]   laws probably unconstitutional laws, but laws that say the electors will be prosecuted
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.360]   if they're faithless, if they don't vote as they've been told to.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.520]   So I wouldn't anticipate any reaction from the electoral college.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:12.560]   It's too soon and it's illegal in some cases and I'm sure there's probably debate, internal
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.560]   debate over all this.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:21.120]   >> In most cases, the electors were chosen because they were a slate that supported the
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   candidate.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   >> Right.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.760]   >> And so they're among the most enthusiastic supporters there.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:33.040]   So the likelihood that you're going to get enough of them to flip and vote their conscience
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.160]   on an issue like this is unrealistic.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.280]   So no, we're in Bayley.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.280]   So I'd say two things.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:46.320]   Number one, it's a genuine constitutional crisis because as you say, the founders didn't
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.960]   know about Twitter, they didn't know about fake news.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.360]   They knew about fake news, but they didn't know about Facebook fake news.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.560]   And they didn't know that.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:04.760]   The other thing though that I think is the more likely outcome of all this is that the
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:11.200]   incoming administration is about to discover the power of entrenched bureaucracies, which
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:18.760]   are capable of acting independently.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.800]   When you have hundreds of thousands of people within an organization, you can bring in a
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   few new people at the top.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.720]   >> But I don't want to- >> You can replace them wholesales.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.240]   >> I don't want to conflate.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.640]   So a lot of people in China are saying, it's over Trump won.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:38.880]   I don't want to conflate a political debate over who won or who should have won with the
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:44.840]   appropriate conversation we should have about if we're being hacked by a foreign nation,
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   what do we do about it?
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.440]   That's the technical conversation.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:54.920]   So let's, I would hope we would still have this debate no matter who won the election,
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.960]   that it's not a matter of, oh, we don't like the result, let's figure out a way to overturn
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   it.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   It is not that.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.680]   It is, what do we do if a foreign nation has the capability of doing this?
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   How do we respond?
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:14.080]   Now the capability, first of all, is not traditional hacking in the sense that they may be hacked
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.720]   the voting machines.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:23.480]   It's a case of them, propaganda, frankly, of them hacking both the DNC and RNC, looking
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:28.360]   for information for both, and then selectively using Wikileaks, releasing the information
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.920]   that was in favor of one candidate against another.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.880]   That's kind of an indirect way of influencing the election.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:41.120]   Although there is a larger concern that maybe they got something from the RNC that they
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.760]   can use against the RNC.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   >> Right.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.240]   >> And blackmail them.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.480]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:57.320]   So there is a national security issue at stake here that goes well beyond who won the election,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   who didn't win the election.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:05.560]   So I don't want this to be, it would be a mistake for us to act as if, and people to
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.360]   misinterpret it as if we're saying, oh, well, Hillary should have won.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   It's not that.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.680]   It's really a question of, well, I mean, what's going on?
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:20.360]   >> If Russian government actors, and the way they do this, by the way, is not direct,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:25.120]   this is part of the debate inside the intelligence services that I understand it, is not whether
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.080]   the Kremlin did it or not, because they use third parties.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.680]   They use Gucci for 2.0, so that they can have plausible deniability.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:40.520]   But really whether if any nation tries to influence us, how do we defend against it?
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.000]   >> Right, and this is tough too, because even if we do a redo vote, in that miraculous
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.720]   event, the damage has already been done.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   >> Right.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   >> You know, like the- >> Well, that's exactly where you don't
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   want to do that.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.040]   They even be better for much or maybe great.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.520]   We got turmoil now.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.400]   >> Then we have turmoil, and it's also like we've also seen in this entire campaign, facts
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.240]   and truth, hasn't had much of an effect either, especially when it comes to Trump.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.200]   They sort of bounce off of him.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.600]   So yeah, it's going to be strange.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   >> See, unfortunately, and the chatroom has completely gone off.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.800]   There's some guy who's changed his handle, the sore loser.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:23.240]   >> This is why we have to close comments whenever we write about hacking or Trump or anything.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.920]   Because- >> So let me ask you, I mean,
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.000]   now those of you who say, "Oh, you're sore losers, is this not a legitimate conversation
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.200]   no matter what happened in the election?
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.520]   Is this not a legitimate conversation?
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.480]   Should we not be concerned about foreign governments hacking?
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.800]   Are you saying, "Oh, it didn't happen?"
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.960]   Or are you saying, "Oh, you just sore losers.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.600]   We won, get over it."
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.800]   Which is, by the way, those are the two sentences that came from the Trump campaign is.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.720]   >> And the reality is that if this had happened, if let's say that the situation was reversed
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.000]   and Hillary Clinton won, and we got the same report-
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.880]   >> Let's pretend that happened.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880]   >> Let's pretend that happened.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.800]   We would be having this exact- >> I would hope so.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.600]   >> I know that we would, and if anything, it would be the fervor would be 10 times harder,
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.800]   where we would actually probably be having more of a substantive conversation about what
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.760]   this means for the future, rather than the very same people who are saying the sore loser
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.640]   talk would be leading the opposition to do as an investigation as possible, and talking
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:25.280]   about as you've all been saying, the broader implications of a different state interfering
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   with our election.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.880]   That's a very, very serious issue, regardless, take the politics out of it.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.160]   Not right there is something that's problematic and is troubling and is something that should
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.080]   be definitely investigate, and I don't know what we can do about it, but sort of like
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.640]   the- >> I would say we can't-
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   >> The election's over.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.280]   >> Yeah, we can't stop it.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   >> Exactly.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:49.760]   >> It's pretty clear that we can't stop anybody from hacking.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:55.840]   We have, we're basically helpless in the face of governmental hackers, just by the way,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.720]   as they are in the face of our hackers, right?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Is that not the case?
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   >> Pretty much, pretty much.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:06.200]   >> It seems, software is imperfect.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.600]   Let's see if we can do this in a logical proof.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.480]   A, software is imperfect.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   Agreed?
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   We stipulate that.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   >> Sure.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:21.760]   >> Imperfect software will always have some form of exploitable security flaw.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.560]   Can we stipulate that?
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   >> Sure.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:31.440]   >> A state actor determined enough with enough resources, resources including their own intelligence,
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:36.720]   but also the ability to spend millions of dollars on other hacking teams and security
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.800]   companies buying exploits.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.600]   That's really where I think a lot of this comes from.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   If you have millions of dollars to spend, you can gain these exploits.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.400]   And they're, I mean, this is the question we ask out security now all the time.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.920]   Is it possible to fully secure anything?
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.720]   Now, obviously Sony Pictures Entertainment was not secure, but we were able to point fingers
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.640]   at an IT team that basically said, "Oh, security, but that's not worth the money."
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.640]   >> We don't care.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.440]   >> Actually, it wasn't the IT team, it was the management said, "We don't care."
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   >> It's the CIO.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   So it was the CIO.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.840]   >> The CIO, yeah.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:17.400]   But then I look at, "Okay, here's my example that I think is a telling example.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.480]   Sheldon Adelson, a very wealthy man, right?
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:27.200]   Is the back end casino operations in, for many casinos in Vegas, Macau is where he made
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.720]   all of his money, lots of money, presumably virtually unlimited resources.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:40.640]   And Iranian hackers were able to hack the SANS back end, which ran the casino operations
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.080]   in many of the casinos in Vegas and steal from it.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:52.040]   Now if you can hack a guy who has unlimited funds and a very strong motivation to secure
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.160]   the back end of the casino operations, I saw Ocean's 11.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.320]   This is stuff that you don't hack.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:05.360]   If they can't do it, I basically feel like it can't be done, right?
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.520]   So we've got a geometric proof that we're screwed.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.920]   >> Any software is horrible.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   So here's, I don't know, my take on it is strip the election results out of it to get
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.480]   the, to take away the- >> There's this big emotional thing
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   going on.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.120]   >> It becomes an emotional response and a distraction.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.400]   Historically, large nations have had spies.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.200]   It's been just what gentlemen did for hundreds of years.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.160]   You use spies to get information so that you could make better decisions, so that you could
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:47.440]   know what your enemy was thinking, what your friends were thinking even.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:53.280]   It's one thing to get information and use that information to make decisions.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.800]   It's another thing to get information and use that information to influence the course
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.400]   of business or the course of government.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:10.480]   So I would take the example, imagine that the Russians had hacked, say, ExxonMobil, and
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.720]   that they had then used the information to compromise contracts with ExxonMobil, making
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:25.760]   it easier for a Russian company to win a lucrative multi-billion dollar contract.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.240]   What would the American response be?
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:34.080]   In that case, I think, I hope we would be outraged at the fact that a foreign nation was interfering
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.440]   with what we like to think of as the free market.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.760]   >> Well, I mean, but again, can we do anything about it and do we have-
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:48.280]   >> Sure, there's things that can be done, but they're the same kinds of things that
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.120]   have been done to spies behind the scenes for years.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:47:01.200]   You don't read about them until typically 30 or 40 years later, after the classification
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:07.680]   on it expires and most of the people involved in it are dead and the handful who are left
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.240]   can talk about it.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:16.520]   But this is exactly the same, this is just a different dimension for the same kind of
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:28.680]   activities that have been going on as long as people have been running governments.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:37.120]   >> That's a very good point.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:43.920]   We've actually seen a lot of recent spy movies that's kind of in the plot of getting the information
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:49.320]   that's going to go much farther and it's because people have decided that that's politics
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.520]   and it's not, it's about-
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   >> La la la.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.480]   >> Yeah, I'm not hearing you because you're talking politics.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.520]   It's not, it's about whether a foreign nation or frankly us, whether it's cyber warfare.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.680]   And I really, I think that we need to think about that.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.040]   And if you, if you who listen to this show don't think about it, I guarantee you nobody
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.680]   else is going to think about it.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.480]   Well, the other thing to say, the other thing to say to those people is, look, the people
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:20.680]   who are making that argument that this is all politics, they say, look, the fact that
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:28.000]   the actors on the other end of this operation have managed to wrap this up in politics so
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.360]   that we can't respond to it in a traditional and rational way is part of the problem, a
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:41.160]   very large part of the problem and somebody has to step up and it's going to take people
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:47.040]   from multiple sides to be able to say we need to be in a non-political approach to
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:53.000]   this but there are national security implications involved and a hell of a lot of technology
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.440]   which is why we're talking about it here.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.320]   >> But don't worry because we're going to get to more important things like why the
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:07.520]   air pods are delayed and everything will be fine.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.720]   Don't worry about it.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720]   We're done now.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   >> I don't know.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720]   >> I don't know what to say.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   >> Russia, Russia, that's why Leo, Russia, the air pods are delayed.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.760]   >> Hey, I'd like to be friends with Russia.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.360]   When you like to be, I mean, what's wrong with that?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.360]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.280]   Let's be friends with Russia.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.840]   Maybe when if we're friends, they will stop messing with us.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   >> Sure.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.800]   That'll totally work.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   >> You know what?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   It's moving right away.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.480]   It's a really interesting conversation and we won't have it today.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:36.320]   But there is a really interesting conversation about whether we have entered a new era.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:48.040]   A couple of things have created this situation but a post-fact era where partly caused by
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.600]   the Internet's ability to create a filter bubble around whatever you want to believe
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:50:00.360]   combined with just an onslaught of information that is very difficult to vet.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:05.440]   So essentially every piece of information, true or not, has equal weight.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.480]   The lack of, this is an interesting thing.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:14.760]   When I was growing up, there was kind of a national consciousness because we all watched
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.280]   the same TV shows at the same time because you couldn't tape them.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.760]   So when people come into work and talk about what Johnny Carson said last night or you
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.120]   would have all been watching the Beatles on Ed Sullivan.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   So there was this kind of interesting situation where the national conversation was kind of,
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.760]   we were all talking about the same things.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.000]   Now, I don't know if that's a good thing or not.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.800]   I think you can make a strong case that wasn't such a good thing because who was controlling
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.160]   that conversation.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.240]   But now we're having a thousand different conversations and you basically decide which
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.520]   bubble you want to be and then you join that bubble and you don't hear anything else.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.920]   And I do think that we're kind of entering this post fact era and I don't know what that
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.240]   looks like in the future.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:05.720]   I mean, you hear terms like moral relativism.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.480]   Well, now we have factual relativism.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.480]   Reality, reality.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.520]   Reality relativism.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   What is that?
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.040]   What is the end game there?
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.440]   What does that end up looking like?
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.640]   Are we all in our own bureaucracy?
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.680]   Yeah, well, it does look a little bit like idiocracy or maybe it looks like Wally where
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:30.360]   we're all riding around on our floating chairs with our VR helmets experiencing our own personal
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.880]   reality that has nothing to do with real reality.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.680]   But what is real reality?
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:40.640]   I think we're at a point where I think librarians and people who study that sort of thing, that's
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.520]   sort of like media training because I remember back in high school and college, that was
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:50.800]   kind of where you started learning about good sources, how to find a good source for your
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   reports and everything.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.640]   And I wonder if we need to have that at a national level, maybe alongside civics, which
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.560]   is also not taught that much anymore in high school.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.680]   But yeah, there's so much stuff going on, information is moving so quickly and we kind
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   of have to teach people to be aware of that and figure things out.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.920]   You know, it's not that propaganda is anything new about propaganda.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.160]   There's not that fake news is not new.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.760]   But that fake news goes back to hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.440]   But what's different is the power and ability to spread this information, the ability that
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.000]   people have to choose an isolated, you know, to put them.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.400]   So I put the filter bubble for years because I said, well, come on.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.240]   You know, ultimately the internet gives you so much information, some of some variety of
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.920]   information is going to leak through.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.480]   You always have at least the opportunity.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.960]   And in many cases, regardless of your choice, you're going to get other points of view.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.080]   Now I'm starting to think maybe that's not true.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.520]   Maybe we really we live in the world.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.720]   We want to believe in and live in the reality we choose.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.640]   Isn't that what all of this technology is kind of like pointing us to is choose your
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   own reality?
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:02.240]   I don't let me let me retweet this and maybe you'll see it, but there was a.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.360]   I don't go to Twitter because it's not true.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.400]   I just I just retweeted this.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.400]   That by the way, I blame Twitter for a lot of this.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.400]   But go ahead.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   I'll read you the study.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:19.440]   There was a study that the MIT Media Lab did of the of the bubbles that you're that you're
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   talking about.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.560]   And there's a there's an interesting visualization that they did.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   Did it.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.160]   Did it show up there is from from reality matters.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.120]   What's your what's your Twitter handle?
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   Ed bot.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   That's easy.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   Not film underscore boy.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:47.920]   Yeah, there was a yeah Clinton and Trump Trump supporters live in their own Twitter
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.360]   worlds and they I saw this.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.360]   I saw this.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.000]   And this so they have a cloud of what are these sources?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.720]   What is what are these dots?
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.400]   So the red dots are follow only Trump.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.480]   The blue dots are follow only Clinton.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:08.360]   The purple dots follow both the gray dots follow neither.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:12.680]   And then this is I'm not sure I really fully understand this, but that's interesting.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:19.480]   Well, there's a if you look at the more solid the color, the bet is the more well the more
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.880]   of a bubble, right?
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.920]   You see better the better for the bubble.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.160]   The better for the bubble.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:30.360]   And I think and there were several people who criticized this graphic, you know, saying
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.320]   there's actually a fair amount of purple.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   Purple.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   It's a lot of purple.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   To the left.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:44.120]   But the really interesting thing there is that bright red thing and and this aligns with
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:51.200]   the thing that we heard from the these kids in Macedonia who were making, you know, $30,000
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.880]   a month building fake news sites.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:58.360]   They said we were building, you know, it is this is this is who we were targeting.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.280]   That's where all that's where all the money was.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:04.560]   What's interesting is they tried targeting these people over here and it didn't make
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.560]   them much money.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:10.960]   No, they said we would put something out there and it would get debunked in five minutes
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.280]   and then nobody would read would retweet it.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.680]   Well, so but I feel like this is the future.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:24.400]   I feel like this is this is susceptible to propaganda is the future.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.680]   This is it's not just look, it's going to be all of us at some point.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:32.760]   This is this is where we're this is where Twitter and Facebook and everybody are pointing
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   us.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.760]   Isn't it?
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.320]   I mean, I think it depends on a lot of things.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.680]   It's self feeding and that's the thing.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.360]   If you've ever played if you've ever played Conway's life or whatever or Osmo, this looks
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.480]   like Osmo, it is self feeding.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.240]   It gets bigger and bigger.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.120]   And at there's some point where it just becomes the universe.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.600]   I mean, I think even on the like on the Hillary's camp, there were certainly bubbles of
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   conferences.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   Absolutely.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   Absolutely.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.960]   There was a lot of talk about the whole pan suit nation like Facebook group, which I can
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.480]   understand why people were excited about it.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.800]   I also feel like that's not as useful as like, you know, broadening the conversation and
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.120]   making the entire country aware.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.280]   I, you know, I try I followed on Facebook.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.440]   I followed every candidate.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.440]   I followed all right.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.520]   All of the Republican and not a potential nominees.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.920]   I followed all the Democratic candidates.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.320]   You followed us the singular or the transhuman scan.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.200]   I got everybody because I wanted to get everybody in my feed, but I bet it's interesting guy.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.800]   Well, but it's interesting because I have a feeling Facebook.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.640]   I think I can guarantee it.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.520]   Modified it so that even though I was following all those Facebook watched my tendencies, which
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:46.240]   stories do you read and not in an attempt to to propagandize me at all, but an attempt
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:52.160]   to maximize my spent my time spent viewing gave me more of what I liked.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:57:00.080]   So even if you try, you get you get funneled in based on what you read.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.240]   This is a problem for journalists.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   Same thing, right?
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   This is.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.240]   Well, I'm doing it right now.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.680]   The chatroom saying, oh, you're political get off the subject.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.840]   So I'm ready to move on.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.840]   That's what happened.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.440]   Talking about the tech around politics.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   I know.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   I know.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.440]   I know.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   I know.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.440]   It's hard not to be influenced by your viewership.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.440]   Yep.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.320]   Give them what they want.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.280]   The thing is, there have definitely been some valid complaints against how the social
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.720]   algorithms are leading us when it comes to news.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.480]   But these sites were never meant to be news readers.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.280]   They're not like Google Reader used to be your and RSS reader.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.520]   It's not just pure data.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.120]   So I don't know.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.120]   I think that's giving them a little bit of more of a break than they deserve because it
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.760]   became very quickly, very early on as soon as they started accepting Twitter especially.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.160]   And I think Facebook is as they had the news feed and started allowing other links into
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.160]   it.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.360]   I think that you have to start considering, you know, and once you start making algorithmic
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.880]   changes based on what people will see and what they'll like and you start personalizing
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.600]   things, I think that those companies, they can't just say they're tech companies, you
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.160]   know, they're they because they are media companies.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   Whether they want to see.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.160]   I'm not saying.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   I know you're not.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   I know you're not.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.600]   I'm talking about the function of a news reader like an RSS reader versus a social feed.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.080]   And the social feed is inherently out.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.400]   Yeah, I think it's time to stop using Facebook for news.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.880]   And that's a big that's.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.200]   But most people won't do that.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   That's the problem, right?
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.840]   No, because it frankly, more to the point, the media industry, I think all of us included
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.960]   have we rely on Facebook for a.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.360]   That's where your links come from.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.360]   It's where your links come from.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.520]   It's where people find you.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.960]   And so it's easy to say we should stop relying on Facebook for news.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.840]   But the reality is it's a big part of Facebook's business and it's a big and Facebook is a
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.280]   big part of the news's business.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.720]   Yeah, it's really an interesting and it's a very open-ended conversation because I don't
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:53.280]   think there's any answers or certainly no easy answers to any of this.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:59.720]   And I do think we're entering a different era and I do think that Twitter and Facebook
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.920]   have a lot to be responsible for.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   I really do.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:08.080]   Maybe less so Twitter because Twitter inevitably is a little more diverse.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:11.960]   It's Facebook that really so actively cultivates the feed.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.600]   Well, but Twitter, I would say, you choose who you follow.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:16.600]   Yeah, you go.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:22.080]   So Twitter, in some ways it's more diverse, but in a lot of ways you explicitly choose
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   who you follow.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:28.480]   So they don't, although they do it now in the mobile app, they have historically not
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.760]   done what Facebook does, which is personalized the feed and kind of determine what you should
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   see.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.760]   They haven't made those sorts of judgments.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.560]   Although, again, they are doing the mobile app.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.160]   But instead it's become much more self-selected.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.600]   So depending on who you follow, that's what you see.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:49.920]   So in some ways they haven't had to answer as many of the questions that Facebook has
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:55.400]   because Facebook, so many people share so many different things and if you like one
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.120]   thing, it can, yeah, I don't know.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.560]   I guess they're slightly different, but yeah.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.560]   Hi.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.000]   Well, we always knew that technology and the internet would change the world.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.200]   We just maybe didn't really understand how much.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   Right.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   Well, it's kind of a reckoning now, right?
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.000]   It's, oh, yeah, they got what they wanted.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.320]   Like Facebook is our de facto solution for being social online, except, oh, now you have
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.000]   civil, you know, civic responsibilities and you better step up to those.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Now, exactly.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.400]   It's like Facebook wanted to be the internet.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400]   Now it is.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Now what?
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]   Yeah, you have to deal with the responsibilities.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   That's how you do it.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   How long did you come along with it?
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.520]   Well, and I think we have also the conflict that started out in the early days of the
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:50.080]   internet, of the web anyway, with which is better, an algorithmic, completely mechanical
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.400]   presentation of information or a curated presentation of information like the old Yahoo
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.200]   lists and the original Moz feeds, you know, things that were where you had experts do
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.200]   those.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.400]   And that was fine when the, you know, when the web was 4,000 pages, it's, you know,
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.240]   it's literally impossible now.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:16.640]   The reality is that Facebook has become a huge newspaper that publishes a new edition
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.600]   every 20 microseconds and there have to be human editors involved in that process, even
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:31.200]   if they're just backstopping the algorithms to avoid things, things going wrong.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.880]   I always thought that this would be a self correcting system.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   I was a fool.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.440]   Well, I really wasn't.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   I think humans too.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.280]   Well, I just thought, you know, there was enough sources and there was enough this and
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.240]   that that it was self correct.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.120]   And what I've realized is quite the opposite.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.960]   We've reached a tipping point and a point of no return, frankly.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.000]   After the whole pizza gate thing, it's like, there's a really good example.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.240]   How could anybody believe that?
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.040]   And it's got a point where, yeah, a guy brings a gun into a freaking pizza shop.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   Right.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   Becomes a real problem.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.480]   And I think what we also mean, I think you we thought that might be self correcting,
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.960]   but it also turns out that there is a financial incentive to create fake news, which I don't
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.440]   think a lot of people will talk coming.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.920]   I know I certainly didn't that you would that there would be as much of a financial incentive.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.760]   Yeah, but we did because it's just it's just the next step of link bait.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   Sure.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.400]   Yeah, but it kind of saw this coming really.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.440]   Well, I mean, I guess, but it seems there's a difference, I think, between link bait and
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.080]   spam and purposely setting them, you know, pseudo newsrooms where people just write
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.840]   ridiculous stories that are that are literally.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.480]   That's what they did.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.160]   They made that's what Upworthy does for a living, by the way, Upworthy, set up by Eli
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.560]   Parriser, who wrote the book about the filter bubble.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560]   He like, sure, figure it out.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.560]   And then said, Oh, good.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.560]   Let's make some money.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.080]   But I guess my point is there's there seems to be a difference though between Upworthy and
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.320]   that sort of level of clickbait versus literally hiring people to write stories that are not
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.040]   only completely made up, but are made up and in our design to appeal to a very specific
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.840]   audience so that you can get the advertising and you can get people to share it.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   You can make it go viral.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.640]   I'm not sure I have to share that.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.000]   I mean, but I think one of the things go ahead.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.240]   Okay, one of the things that we've learned though in all these years is that any tool
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:31.880]   that you put out there is going to be abused by completely a moral actors as quickly as
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.880]   possible.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.480]   So that's how we got viruses.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:39.240]   That's how we got ransomware.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.360]   That's how we got advertising scams.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:49.440]   And so it was completely predictable if you look at the evolution of who used the technology
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.280]   out there.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:57.600]   The only difference between journalists like those of us on these screens here and these
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:05.360]   fake news guys is that we have a professional code and morals where we actually have a line
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.040]   that we draw where we say, okay, I can't do that.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.680]   I can't do this.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.200]   Gee, I want this to be a really sexy headline and I know maybe it's slightly misleading.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   We're just old fashioned.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.000]   That's just old fashioned.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.400]   Well, I mean, but that's-
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.000]   Scruples are- Forget scruples.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.320]   That's old fashioned.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   That's old folks.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.600]   Well, we have reputations that we want to protect.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   The journalistic code.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.240]   That's just, you know, let's go back to the front page.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.640]   That's 19th.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.400]   But to what we were talking about earlier, I think even more so than like clickbaity headlines,
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.200]   you could look at like the Tibula links.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.400]   Tibula is the garbage that has basically cluttered the internet and we've grown so
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.080]   you used to it and big publishers are making money off of it.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.640]   I think, you know, my site is a whole bunch of sites are.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.520]   Ad tech is- We've grown used to that and that's, I think, a bigger problem when it comes
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   to the-
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.920]   Yeah, there was a story on The New York Times today that was about like fake news and there
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.920]   was an ad for like a fake ad about saying like Alec Baldwin had died.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   Yep.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.720]   And that happens a lot, you know, and that's just because of the ad.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.400]   And then it ended up, he didn't really die.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.120]   He's taking a diet pill that you should be taking also.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.120]   Great.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.120]   Watch this gallery.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.120]   Watch this gallery.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.520]   On the page on the- There was a- There was an interesting medium article the other day.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:31.200]   On the page on Facebook where Zuckerberg says, you know, we've been doing soul searching
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.800]   about this fake news thing and we're trying to come up with solutions but we don't think
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.920]   it, you know, influenced the election blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280]   Somebody, you know, did a screenshot of that.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.360]   Zuckerberg's article with two fake news ads next to it.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.880]   I mean, it was just like you can't get any more perfect than that.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:56.800]   And there, ultimately when you get down to it, all of this technology is being monetized
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:05.800]   in ways that if you take the morality out of it and you take the controls, quality controls
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.320]   out of it, you end up where we are now.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   All right.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:18.080]   Well, I don't know if we're ever going back to the good old days but sure was fun when
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   it lasted.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.240]   I'm going to go just move into- I'm going to move to Macedonia.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.360]   Actually, it's a beautiful country.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360]   It's really gorgeous.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.360]   Highly recommend it.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.360]   All right.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:34.920]   Let's take a break and we have spent a lot of time on this and I think a good, really
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   good conversation.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.640]   I mean, I don't think it's the end of this conversation.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.120]   I just, I think a lot about this and I don't know what the answer is.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.360]   I really don't.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:46.440]   But, and I don't know if there is, I don't know if there's anything you can do about
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.440]   it.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.240]   I mean, I don't, I mean, you decide from censorship or something.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.080]   I don't, I know, we, nobody wants that.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.440]   I don't think there's anything you can do.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.440]   We're a population.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   That's what we need.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.520]   Well, we are, we're human and so we're going to get that.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520]   That's what we're going to get.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.760]   We're going to get humans.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.760]   And it's like you gave a kid a nuclear weapon and then you're shocked that he used it.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.960]   Now you're talking about the Trump presidency.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   That was political.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   Why are we laughing?
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.480]   Let's not laugh at that.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.480]   There's nothing to laugh at.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.480]   It's terrifying.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   But it's kind of, it's like that.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.480]   We, we're humans.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:23.080]   We, we, we, there's no, you know, it's not like there's 10% of humans are bad and the rest
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.080]   are good.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.960]   We all have 10% bad, I think.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.000]   Some are really bad, but I mean, we all have a little bit of bad in us and we just gave
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.400]   ourselves tools and then we're surprised that what happened was, you know, we, we all
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.480]   end up throwing excrement at the monkey cage.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.880]   I don't know.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.720]   That's, it's very interesting.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:50.240]   But Ed, you and I, and I think Christina and Devinda, we're going to uphold journalistic
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.640]   standards and integrity.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.480]   I've always, I've always said that.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.080]   I really feel like that's important.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.520]   And I, you know, my kid wants to be, he's 22, he's in college, he wants to be a journalist.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.440]   And I, and I'm continually kind of feeding him this line.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.920]   And I hope his professors are too about journalistic integrity and the rules and you owe it to
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.280]   your readers, you owe it to, you know, that this, you know, there's a way to do it.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.720]   And he's getting the AP style guide and legal manual for Christmas.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.440]   And I just, you know, I'm hoping.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.920]   I just hope that brings, that brings literally a tear to my eye.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.760]   And it does.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.960]   Jim Latterback way back when we did tech TV wrote a statement of ethics.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.040]   And he was really, I was really, I really will always honor Jim for doing this.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.680]   And he went around in our studio and he taped over every brand name.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.800]   I mean, it's very old fashioned.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.040]   And but, but he was really right on.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.880]   He came from the old Ziff Davis days where there was this kind of standard and it was
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.360]   beat into you, you know, let's take a break.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.400]   We have a great panel here to vendor hard war from and gadget.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.640]   He is a senior editor, senior writer for Gizmodo.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.160]   Christina Warren is here.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.640]   I love all of you guys.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.320]   I think we just want to shut the rest of the world out and hang with you guys.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.800]   Just chill with you guys.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.840]   And Ed bought my old friend from ZD net known Ed 20 plus years now.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   He 20 gets probably did at least 25.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.080]   You were editor in chief of windows magazine, right?
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.520]   PC computing.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520]   PC computing.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520]   That's it.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:33.880]   When we, Jabor, I can I used to have you on the radio show way back when.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.440]   I think that was one of my first computer magazines too.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440]   So yeah, right.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   I love PC computing.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   Always love.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440]   It was a great magazine.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.440]   Mm hmm.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.360]   There are any magazines anymore at all.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.000]   I mean, computer magazines.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   I don't think so.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.320]   Go into the airport and see them.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   Wired.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   Okay.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.720]   They still do crazy because it's culture really as much as anything else.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.520]   But like the hardcore magazine is gone.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.520]   PC computing long gone windows windows magazine laptop is still around.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520]   Laptop.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.520]   Laptop.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.520]   Okay.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.520]   There you go.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520]   They have a thing.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   Why?
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.520]   People like laptops.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520]   I don't know.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   Wired man.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   I hope we get back more into tech.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   All right.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.680]   Ed's going to call us back while we do a little break here.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.360]   We want to talk about my mattress.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.560]   Hey, at least I sleep well at night.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   Thanks to Casper.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   That's important.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.000]   Getting a good night's sleep on your Casper mattress.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.200]   There are some amazing things the internet has brought us.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.760]   And this is an example of you don't have to go to a mattress store and lie on a mattress
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.520]   in broad daylight with a salesperson staring at you going get your shoes off my mattress.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.200]   Let alone, you know, rolling around, maybe bringing your honey and doing a little smooching.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.640]   You don't get to test the mattress of the mattress store.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.120]   As a result, you get at home and well, good luck with Casper.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.160]   You're testing your mattress at home for a hundred days.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.360]   You get a great deal on a mattress that's obsessively engineered in the United States
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.200]   for outrageous comfort.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.640]   It's really I they comes in a very compact box.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.320]   You open it up, smells beautiful.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.640]   It breathes.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.560]   You sleep cool at night.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.800]   It's comfortable and you will love it.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.520]   It is literally changing the way people shop for mattresses.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.720]   Look, they got a dog mattress.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.880]   That's so cute.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.720]   I want you to go to Casper.com and check out these amazing Casper mattresses.

[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.000]   You got to go to Casper.com/TwIT.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.160]   It is a trial.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.680]   Even in a hundred nights, you say, "Yeah, they will come and they will get it."
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.800]   You don't have to fit it back in the box, I promise.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   They will come.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800]   They will get it.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.560]   They will take it away and refund you every penny.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.400]   The design story behind the Casper is fascinating.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:11.440]   They spent a lot of time, did a great many prototypes, 108 prototypes, 100 plus formulations.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:18.560]   They were looking for firmness, airflow, density, transition temperature, rebound speed and
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.640]   odor.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.240]   I swear to God, these things are important.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:28.680]   I have to tell you, they got it right, but you don't have to take my word for it.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   You can try it.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.840]   If it's not perfect for you, you got plenty of time to return it.

[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.360]   We're talking tech.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.720]   The latest thing, and I wasn't joking, is the AirPods.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.720]   The AirPods.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.120]   Apple's AirPods.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.120]   Remember, I don't know if it was real or fake.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   Was it on this motor?
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.120]   I have a pair.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   I have a pair.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   Everybody has a pair.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.320]   The journalists have the pre-production pair.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.760]   Yes, we do.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.080]   They're not in the stores.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.760]   I think this is a big deal since Apple took the headphone check out.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:25.200]   You got to think they want to get these AirPods out into the market, but does anybody know
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.920]   where they are and why?
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.560]   The closest report, there's a Wall Street Journal story that basically says that they
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.840]   were having.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.920]   It kind of completes a few things.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.760]   It kind of makes some suppositions about the fact there might have been some manufacturing
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.200]   problems, which John Goober's sources kind of confirmed that they've had a hard time
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.920]   kind of mass producing them.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.080]   Then the Journal goes on to kind of suppose they might have had some issues getting the
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   two pieces to independently talk to one another.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:59.640]   Because how AirPods work versus a lot of other fully wireless earbuds is that each bud has
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.440]   an individual wireless signal to your phone rather than how a lot of them work, not all
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.440]   of them.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.400]   Some of them do what Apple's doing as well, but how a lot of them work is that one is
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.920]   paired to your phone and the other is paired to the other bud.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.560]   That can lead to some lagging.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.640]   Have you noticed that on yours?
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   No, my AirPods, they're fine.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.680]   What I found out with other purely wireless headphones is that they can't have a lag issue
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.720]   because one of them is paired to the left ear is paired to the right ear and the right
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.080]   ear is paired to the phone.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.200]   In the case of AirPods, they're both paired to the phone.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.000]   They both have an independent signal coming.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.360]   The Journal's story kind of intimates and says that it's possible that they could have
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.840]   had a problem with some of the radio stuff and the Bluetooth stack.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.600]   I guess that's possible, the pre-production ones, which they gave to Journalist, which
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.920]   are obviously not the ones that have been mass produced, have been fine.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.920]   I mean, I have a...
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920]   I have a...
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920]   How do you...
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.960]   Renee Riching, nobody I know you has had a problem with them.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.880]   So what John Gruber's sources have told him is that it's been more of a mass production
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.280]   issue, which could make some sense.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.600]   I think that this is a different type of product for them and they might have run into some
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.840]   production problems.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.640]   Regardless of whatever the reason is, it certainly is not great that something is...
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   Three months.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   Three months.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.560]   And that was touted, it was supposed to be out in late October and was then delayed.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.640]   You're not going to have it out in time for Christmas.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.400]   That's a bigger deal, right?
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.200]   Because this is a perfect stocking stuff or even at 150 bucks.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.240]   Oh, it's a perfect stocking stuffer for a lot of people, they want them.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.680]   And so, yeah, I mean, Gruber's sources say manufacturing problems at scale, it doesn't
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.120]   matter what the reason is.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:50.000]   The reality is we're not going to get them in time for Christmas or borrowing some sort
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.680]   of miracle, they're not going to be done in the next two weeks.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:01.360]   And I think that Apple had introduced them obviously, right, as kind of a way I think
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.880]   to lessen the sting of getting rid of the headphone jack.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:13.200]   In all honesty, I think that most people who have an iPhone 7 haven't really had that
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   much.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.200]   I haven't had a problem.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.600]   It's one of those things that the included adapter worked well.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.920]   And I actually got a pair of new Bluetooth headphones recently that have the W10 chip.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.920]   Oh, really?
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.920]   Yeah, I got that.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.920]   So somebody's making W1 headphones.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.080]   Yeah, W1 headphones, Beats is.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.520]   So you get the Beats low three.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.520]   It's you get the Beats X, but they have two pairs.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.520]   They have two of them available.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520]   And that chip is fantastic.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.360]   So let me ask you this, and I don't know if you notice it, but in my opinion, Bluetooth
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.760]   headphones don't not sound as good as wired headphones.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.520]   There's a compression that just doesn't that it's the music isn't as open.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.480]   It doesn't it doesn't feel as good.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480]   It's fine for voice.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.320]   I mean, I think that it depends on the pair of headphones.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.840]   I think that there are four hundred dollar pair of Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, because
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.440]   I said, well, maybe you're right.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.040]   Maybe it's just because I'm buying cheap Bluetooth headphones and I bought a lot of
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.680]   them, including Beats.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.560]   And so I said, well, let's get the top of the line.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.440]   The most expensive ones I could find were the Sennheiser's every raves about them.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440]   Same exact thing.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.120]   There's some sort of it's not and that makes sense because you got it.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.320]   They don't have a lot of bandwidth.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.000]   They get to compress it a little bit.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.080]   So it depends on the source too, right?
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.520]   Because if you connect this to a MacBook for some reason, OS X, it has aptX support
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   for Bluetooth, but iOS.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.200]   Oh, so listen.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.200]   Okay.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.200]   Because aptX is supposed to be better.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.200]   Is it better?
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.200]   It's a little better.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.400]   It makes it's less compression and higher quality all around.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400]   Okay.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   I'll try that.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   I'll do it on my back book.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.040]   What I find sometimes like I would say this, I would say that a four hundred dollar pair
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.920]   of wired headphones are certainly going to sound better than a four hundred pair of
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920]   Bluetooth headphones.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:50.080]   But the decent pair of Bluetooth headphones will probably sound everybody's good as a decent
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   pair.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   Let's face it.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.760]   You're selling it to a market of kids that have been wearing the include earbuds on their
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760]   iPhones for years.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.760]   They don't know.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.760]   Without a doubt.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.240]   I mean, in the Beats, I love them because they're great subway phones and I like them
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240]   for the fashion.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.160]   I would never say they're the best audio quality.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   I buy them.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:13.240]   I buy them because they're rose gold and now the new ones have a 40 hour battery life.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.640]   You bought them because they're rose gold?
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   Absolutely.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.080]   I bought my last pair last year and I spent another three hundred dollars this year to
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080]   get the upgraded pair.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.600]   Do you wear them with the Snapchat spectacles?
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.640]   I mean, that's a little mutt.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.640]   I mean, okay.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   Come on.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   Probably.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.640]   Probably.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   Probably.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.360]   What am I going to see you on the F line wearing the Snapchat and the blue and the thing?
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360]   Yeah, probably.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.360]   I hate myself.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   But yeah.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.360]   What's the best thing back to you?
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.040]   These are my subway headphones.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.040]   I don't wear these.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040]   They are though.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.320]   Some headphones are great because yeah, you don't want to eat course to tangle you and
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.560]   there's going to be a lot of noise, right?
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.240]   So it's not like a high quality audio experience.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.360]   You just need something loud to block out everybody else.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360]   Right.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.080]   I was thinking about like nose clips so you can't smell everybody else.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   You need that.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.560]   Sometimes you do.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.560]   Sometimes you do.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.320]   I love the situation where I like go into a train car and with everyone else.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.320]   Everyone takes a sniff and just backs out.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.840]   There's one guy sleeping on the other thing and the rest of the car is empty.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.400]   And there are other cars are jammed.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.400]   Yes, exactly.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.480]   Everybody's like you see it come across and you're like, Oh, empty car.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.880]   Then you step on and you're like, Nope, no, no.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.240]   Too good to be true.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:30.000]   I think if you live long enough in New York, you lose the sense of smell for urine.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.080]   It just doesn't, you can't smell it anymore.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.080]   I don't know.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.080]   You get to the middle of the disco.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.080]   You're just go.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   Yes.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.080]   Oh, you're right.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:44.120]   Honestly, I've seen a lot more like stuff in San Francisco.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:51.200]   Well, then the sad thing about San Francisco is the homeless in camp is in the city hall,
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.800]   you know, park there right in front of city hall.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.680]   That's where everybody lives.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.680]   The sad situation.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.680]   That's a sad situation.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.680]   I don't know what's.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.680]   I was back to like talking about the Apple stuff.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.520]   Like why did we lose the head down Jack in the first place?
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.360]   It was for a bigger, was it the touch thing, right?
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.360]   The three.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.760]   Yeah, bigger touch process, whatever.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.920]   Who cares?
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920]   Who cares?
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.760]   Like what, what added functionality to that?
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.200]   I know it added some links and you like tactile features when you're scrolling through menus
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.320]   and what I was 10.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.680]   But otherwise, who cares?
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.960]   I think most people would have rather kept plugging in their headphones as they would.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.120]   I mean, I would.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.920]   I agree with you.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.240]   My conspiracy theory, which is in no way spaced out in any sort of reporting that I have
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240]   at all.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   So it's completely conspiracy.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   When I just put that out there.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:41.840]   But my theory is that they really did it this time because for the big redesign phone
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   that we're supposed to get, they needed the space.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.920]   My theory is the Russians did it.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.560]   It's all the Russians fault.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.720]   My theory was get everybody ticked off this time and let them get it out of their system
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.720]   and everything fired.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:58.200]   And then next year in the iPhone 8, that would not get the attention it would have gotten
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.200]   if they'd waited to.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.200]   Exactly.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.600]   They didn't want it to take away from, oh, this beautiful redesign with all this other
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   stuff they're doing.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, that is how fake news.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.320]   She just made that up.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.640]   You just you just watched it.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   But it's possible.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.640]   It's possible.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.440]   I'm going to go tweet that right now.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.520]   I have a bad walk away, but don't tweet it yet because I have an opposing viewpoint because
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.040]   who is the number one Bluetooth headphone manufacturer in the world?
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.680]   It's Apple beats.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.360]   So they get rid.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.000]   They get rid of the headphone jack.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.720]   Who does that benefit?
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.480]   Bluetooth headphone manufacturers.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.240]   And if Apple could just get their gosh darn Bluetooth headphones out the door.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.240]   Right.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.240]   Seriously.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.240]   Profit.
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.680]   So there's I think there's two there's two motives.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.560]   I think you know what's really sad?
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.840]   I think you're going to see other companies do the same thing now because they're slaves
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.080]   to Apple and Apple got rid of it.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.880]   It must be the right thing to do.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.880]   Well, I reviewed.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.880]   Okay.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:56.880]   So who was it?
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   It was a Motorola who didn't have it on one of their phones.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.360]   The Z doesn't have a headphone jack.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360]   Z doesn't have it.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.960]   And then I reviewed a LICO.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.640]   How ever you say their name?
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.160]   How do you say that?
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   Echo.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   Echo.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.400]   It's Chinese and they have a French name.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.560]   Yeah, and sometimes they say LICO.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.560]   I don't know.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.880]   Anyway, I reviewed what was their S3 their S pro three or whatever.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:25.920]   And that has USB C. So it comes with these earphones that look just like ear pods like
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.920]   they look identical to your pods.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.040]   But it has a USB C jack instead.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.800]   And you know, the rumor is that the S8 is going to not have the headphone jack after
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.280]   Samsung made hay about, oh yeah, our phone has the headphone jack, but the S8 is reportedly
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.280]   not going to have it either.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.280]   So I mean, yeah, I think you're right.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.440]   I mean, people just follow the.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   Wow.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   They just follow Apple.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.360]   It seems like this is like one of many like anti consume room moves.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.120]   I think Apple has been making lately like there are arguments to be made to about like the
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:02.600]   new MacBook pros and how disappointing those are as upgrades, you know, lacking other reports
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.440]   that people may need or the touch bar.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.000]   And it's like who like is that going to be as useful as people think versus.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   Experience.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   I don't know.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.720]   I'd love to hear what you think, but my experience with the touch bar, which I thought, I mean,
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.880]   it has a high cool factor because it's very cool.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.880]   It's going to be great.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   I like that.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   It's really good.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:23.360]   But I never use the track bar because I don't, it's always different.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.680]   And I have to look down to see what it is this day and it's a little funny useful.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.680]   So I just don't use it.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.760]   Yeah, there's certain apps I use it in, but most apps I don't.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.200]   And I think that and was what I wrote in my review was basically like it could become
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.200]   useful.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.120]   It's really going to depend on third party to support.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.720]   And unfortunately, that comes kind of like like comes out of like forced touch.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:48.040]   I kind of think it doesn't ever become useful because it's just, you know, we're all taught
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.720]   to touch type to not look at the keyboard.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720]   Right.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.520]   And I just, Krasinski told me in ninth grade, do not look at the keyboard.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.720]   And so I'm looking at the screen and there's nothing.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.200]   And I'm not looking down at the keyboard.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.960]   Nobody's taught to type anymore.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.840]   I think people just kind of get with it.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.960]   Like I know a lot of people, young people who don't type properly, they're still doing
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.960]   two fingers too.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.800]   So it's, it's kind of tough.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.440]   But I guess my bigger issue is that they spent so much time on that touch bar and not
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:20.200]   unlike actual functional things that professional users may want in a Macbook Pro.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.480]   So I'm just getting kind of worrisome, like just having USB C ports, which love that you
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.400]   can't even connect, you know, the iPhone.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.480]   So by the way, those sorts of things are ridiculous.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.840]   Do you like the Echol, the S3?
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   It's fine.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.840]   It's cheap.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840]   It's 250 bucks.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840]   It's very cheap.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.840]   And so here's the thing.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.000]   I did a battle between that and the one plus three T and the one plus three T is because
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.520]   their specs are almost identical.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.720]   And the one plus three T is a better phone.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720]   Okay.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.880]   So it can cost, you know, in some cases, $150 more.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.440]   Is $150 better?
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:59.720]   No, I think the S3 Pro or the S Pro 3 is a, it's a very nice phone.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.080]   I don't love some of the, excuse me, the L Pro 3.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080]   I'm wrong.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:11.560]   They have an S3 Pro or something that's even cheaper, but the L Pro 3 can sell for, you
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   know, like $300.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.240]   Yeah, but it is often available for 300 because they have this like, Lib Rewards
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   program.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.680]   And so for a $300 phone, I think it's very good.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.320]   There's some software things I don't love about it.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.480]   And that's, I think that like, I would definitely install a different launcher on it for one
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.480]   thing.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.560]   Oh, I always do though on every phone I do.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.120]   But I think that in terms of everything else, I mean, it's a very good for me.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.680]   Big battery.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.680]   Very big battery.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.480]   It's got basically the same specs as a pixel.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.880]   And you know, that's impressive.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.200]   So I think that for a few hundred bucks less.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.080]   I mean, I think that for a lot of people, like you get the pixel, you know, because you
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.440]   want to be part of, you know, get the pure Google experience and all of that.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:03.240]   But I certainly wouldn't think that it would be worth spending more than twice as much.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:15.000]   And that's why so many of these Chinese companies are starting to really impinge on the market
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.880]   that, you know, Samsung and LG and HTC have historically had with phones that instead
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:28.000]   of being 650, 750 bucks, they're selling for $299 to $399.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.320]   That were from a functional hardware point of view, they're almost identical.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.120]   Yeah, I really love the Axon 7 from ZTE.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.160]   That was my one of my favorite phones.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.960]   And I think you know, OnePlus 3T is fantastic.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960]   OnePlus 3T is great.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.400]   Like I would in some cases recommend like the OnePlus 3T over the Pixel, because I don't
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.160]   think that Google Assistant is that useful yet.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.160]   And it's great.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   The Pixel is great.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.440]   Yeah, I don't know if it's, yeah, I don't know.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.000]   The Pixel is my daily driver right now.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.640]   And finally enough, the smaller Pixel, not the bigger one.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.120]   But it's just, it's funny, it doesn't inspire in any way when you look at it.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   It's kind of, right.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120]   It's just another.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.160]   But there's something about it.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.760]   It's just, it's a very practical, useful phone.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.640]   It's a shame it's so expensive.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:20.640]   I kind of feel bad for our HTC these days, just seeing all these other phones that have
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.920]   basically lifted the HTC One design from a couple of years ago.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.240]   Like even Apple has kind of lifted that design.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.800]   The Axon 7 looks just like an HTC One.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   Exactly like it.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.200]   So it's, it's really funny that the Google Pixel phones are built by HTC, but kind of
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.800]   echoing that design as well.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   Don't look that good.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800]   Totally.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.360]   I wish I kind of like it.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   It's okay.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   Front facing speakers though.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.160]   I wish they would do that.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160]   I love that.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.840]   I'm going to stick with the Pixel.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:54.000]   And I think any Android phone users should probably, just because security is a big issue
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   now.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.080]   And you want to get the updates.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.000]   My Pixel already has the November 5th update.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.840]   And I'm sure you can't say that of any other.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.200]   I think Blackberry, but they're not on NuGet.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.960]   So weirdly, I mean, and by Blackberry, I mean, parentheses, Blackberry, because it's really
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   Alcatel, and then the Blackberry software.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.240]   The Blackberry node is doing a pretty good job with the software updates.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.120]   They're one of the only, and you will never hear me saying nice thing about Blackberry.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.200]   I will actually give them credit for that.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.600]   They are actually pushing out the security.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.560]   This cool-looking thing is very scary.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.640]   We've been talking about this on security now.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.480]   More than a million Google accounts now hacked by Gooligan according to Checkpoint software.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:38.840]   They're seeing 13,000 devices breached every single day.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.160]   You get it if you're using an older phone that's not up to date.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160]   Right.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.160]   It has to be like 4.4 or earlier.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.160]   Right.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.800]   But that's the vast majority of Android phones though.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   Right.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.000]   And you still have to do a bad thing.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.160]   You have to go to a third party store and download an app.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.120]   But still, so many people in parts of the world where they don't use the Google store
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   do that.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:05.800]   I mean, so, you know, and I guess this was not to go back all the way to our earlier discussion.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.960]   This is why I get annoyed when like Verizon won't issue an update because you can't,
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.400]   we can't, I mean, this is the problem with Android.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.680]   You know, Google made that deal with basically letting the carriers, you know, worldwide
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.040]   have control over this stuff.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.480]   And so they can't, they don't have any control in the OEMs of that matter too.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:26.120]   So they don't have any ability to push stuff out.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.120]   All right.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.200]   We got to take a break.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.040]   Ed's only got half an hour left before he turns into a pumpkin.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.160]   I don't want to have to turn into a pumpkin.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.520]   It happened once before it wasn't a pretty sight.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:43.000]   I can go for, I can go 40 minutes, but that's like that.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.400]   And then, and then an orange cloud.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   Poof.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   Poof.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   I showed it.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:54.400]   I brought to you by the best backup solution you can imagine carbonite online backup.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.040]   My God, how many times do I have to tell you people you got a backup?
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:02.760]   I still get calls all the time from people whose hard drives died.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.280]   Actually, most often, you know, you could talk about the big disasters.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.200]   You know, there's a fire, my whole business burnt down or whatever.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.600]   But most of the time it's, let's face it, human error, right?
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.160]   Human error, you deleted a file and you go, oops, empty the trash.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.160]   Oops.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.120]   Carbonite online backup.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:24.840]   This is the one and only defense against ransomware, against human error, against acts
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.160]   of God.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.560]   It's cloud backup.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.720]   If you go to carbonite.com, you get it for Mac or PC.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720]   You can get it for home or office.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.040]   They've got a lot of different plans.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.840]   They even have a plan where you get a physical hardware device.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.160]   So you have a local backup and then it backs up to the cloud.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.240]   That's of course for businesses.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.120]   They got server backup and more.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.400]   But in every case, you can try it for free and you don't have to give them a credit card.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.040]   So it's one of the, it's a real free trial, not one and that's going to trick you into
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.040]   it.
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.040]   You renewing or whatever.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.680]   Go to carbonite.com and give it a shot.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.840]   Automatic backup.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:57.840]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.000]   You pay once a year or even once every two or three years if you want.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   And then you're just done.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.080]   It's backing up whenever you're online.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.360]   You can get to your stuff anytime.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.520]   It's always a nice feeling.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.320]   I don't like backup solutions where you can't tell.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:15.240]   With carbonite, you can log on to your carbonite account on any computer and see everything.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.840]   You can even download it and email it.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.280]   So it's cloud storage too.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.280]   They have free apps.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.120]   You can do it on your devices.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.320]   It's got all the features you're looking for for business as well as for home.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320]   Very affordable.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.680]   The home plan, $59 a year for everything on a computer.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.880]   That's less than five bucks a month.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.840]   They have backed up half a trillion files now.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.680]   More importantly, they've restored.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.760]   I can't remember what the number was.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.680]   It was like five billion files restored.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.960]   That's five billion files that would be lost forever if people weren't using backup from
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:48.960]   carbonite.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.760]   A million and a half homes in small business just trust carbonite and all I'm asking is
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.760]   it?
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.760]   You try it free.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:58.080]   You can use the offer code when you do it.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:02.920]   You'll get two free months when you buy carbonite.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:08.120]   You got to back it up to get it back to it right with carbonite.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.120]   Pewdiepie.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   What's going on?
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.800]   I don't even know if we should talk about Pewdiepie.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.360]   He deletes his YouTube channel.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   No, not really.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.560]   He trolled us.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.560]   He trolled us.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.120]   Honestly, he was never going to delete that channel.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.400]   He makes millions of dollars a year as far as I can tell.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.400]   He's the highest paid YouTuber.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.400]   He's the highest paid YouTuber.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:33.760]   Does anybody really know what people get paid though on YouTube?
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.600]   No, but they have, Forbes is able to do their analysts the same way they do on their other
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.600]   lists.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:46.600]   I guess they have some, I don't know, but according to my all accounts, he's making
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.600]   millions.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:48.600]   He's making millions of dollars.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.000]   I love Mashable's headline on this.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.040]   Forbes 2016 list of highest paid YouTubers will make you weep.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.040]   That's a Mashable line.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.600]   I think I try though.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600]   You used to work there.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.240]   You know how the sausage is made.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.720]   And I'm rolling my eyes.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.720]   Love it.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.720]   Love it.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.720]   Love it.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.720]   Love it.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.160]   So what you, what, what, what, what, what Pewdiepie did is he said, my numbers are going
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.320]   down and I think it's racist.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.200]   I think it's because I'm white.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   Oh my God.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:22.320]   And that Lily Singh, she's, she's not white and she's, so she's getting more promotion
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   for YouTube.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   She's got a lot of money.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.320]   I'm not sure.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.320]   I'm not sure.
