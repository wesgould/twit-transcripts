[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.600]   the week's tech news, joining us this week.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.680]   As I go around the table, a nice cast of very talented people,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.840]   including somebody who hasn't been on Tuit in a while,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.200]   but is here to celebrate 10, 10, 10, John Graham coming
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.000]   to the website.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.560]   I'm Jay GC.org, the author of the geek atlas.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.400]   Hi, John.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.800]   Hi, how you doing, Leo?
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.400]   Coming to us all the way from the UK.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.200]   Where in England are you?
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   I'm in Basement, of course.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.680]   And I'm in London.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.600]   In Basement, England.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.760]   I'm surprised there isn't a town in England
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.400]   named in the Basement.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   She wouldn't surprise me if there was.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.640]   The Basement don't probably be pronounced like that.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   Right.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.320]   It's pronounced Darbyshire.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.200]   Also with this John C. de Vorack in the lovely shirt,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.880]   the connotes--
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.640]   Commemorative.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.760]   --find dining.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.960]   What is--
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.560]   It's a commemorative Hawaiian shirt
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.160]   the kind you used to wear--
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.520]   I would, if I had--
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.160]   --on the old screensaver show before the suits
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.240]   told you to stop it.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.280]   I asked them once if I could wear bowling shirts.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.840]   They said it was too down market.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200]   So I was wearing Hawaiian shirts, and then they said stop it.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.120]   What is commemorating--
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.440]   Commemorating-- what?
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.080]   What?
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.160]   That's sharing the loss of the Hawaiian shirt to this show.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.600]   Oh.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.360]   I don't know.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.040]   What does it mean?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   It's got food, wine, sushi.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.320]   Yeah, just so.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   Is it one of those jams world shirts
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.120]   that people like to collect that just
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.480]   got a bunch of designs on it?
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.160]   I like it.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.880]   It's like wearing art.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.240]   OK.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.120]   Some might call it that.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.680]   Also here with this--
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.560]   I'm so glad to have him.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.680]   Tom Merritt, he hasn't been on.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   I've been very careful and protective of his time,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680]   because of course he's our day by day host of our Tech News
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.640]   show Tech News today.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.760]   Hey, Tom.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.320]   Hey, Leo, how's it going?
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.080]   Since we acquired Tom in a trade in June for a player
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.040]   to be named later, he has not been on Twitch.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.440]   So this is your first time.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   That's right, because the last Twitch I did
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.160]   was the day before I started, or two days before I started.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.840]   And it really is a case of me trying
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.920]   to protect the franchise.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.320]   I don't want anybody to think that TNT is Twitch,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.000]   or vice versa.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.480]   Or vice versa.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.120]   And, well, I don't mind the other way around.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.600]   And this is your day off.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.080]   So thank you for being here.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.320]   Yeah, though I was going to come up to the cottage,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.520]   but then I was doing podcasts all morning
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.320]   and ran out of time.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.400]   On your big day off.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.880]   Well, thanks for being here.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.760]   And finally, last but certainly not least,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.040]   from Gadget, GDGT.com.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.720]   Ryan Block is here.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.920]   And the reason I wanted to have you on, Ryan, actually,
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.520]   there's so much I could talk to you about,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.400]   the launch of the Google TV and so forth.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.640]   But you did a fairly--
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.360]   I would say a fairly big deal article this week.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   You're calling it Glass Gate about the iPhone 4.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.520]   That's-- I certainly did use that.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.680]   I was kind of tongue in cheek.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   Too late!
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   Too late!
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.280]   No, no, no, that's certainly the shorthand,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.880]   I think, that's going to stick.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.200]   So if not, that's awesome.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.480]   Let me recap.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.560]   Apple sells actually at this time in their stores,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.640]   but one iPhone case, it's their own bumper case, which
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.040]   doesn't in any way cover the front or the back.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.520]   It's just a plastic rim that goes around the case.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.040]   It has one chief merit, which is that it fixes the antenna
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.600]   problem.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.480]   And I guess if you dropped it on the edge,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.400]   it might protect it.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.120]   But it's really-- it's about as minimalist as a case
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.280]   as you can get.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.160]   I use-- in fact, I'll show you what
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.720]   I've been using up till I read your article, a case
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.200]   that I bought from the AT&T store from a company called
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.160]   Life Frogs with a Z. It's a slip-on case that covers the back.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.560]   And I kind of like the idea because it protects the back.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.000]   Well, apparently, that's not what's happening.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.200]   Tell us what's going on, Ryan.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.480]   Well, how far back in time do you want me to go?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.680]   I mean, is it worth kind of getting
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.080]   into how Apple's whole system of selling stuff works?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.480]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.680]   So some people who've been in the industry
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.880]   have kind of seen this system for a very long time.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.960]   And not very many other companies outside
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.480]   of the gaming world tend to do this.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.520]   But Apple does-- way back in the day,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.240]   I think it was 2003, 2002.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.080]   When the iPod was first starting to take off,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.520]   they created a made-for-ipod program.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.480]   And what that meant was they would license third-party
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.360]   iPod accessories.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.880]   And a licensed accessory meant that you got access
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.280]   to Apple's CAD schematics for the devices,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   sometimes in advance of launch.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.400]   So you could have the accessories ready.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.880]   And you get low-goats.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.440]   Microsoft does this with made-for-windows, too,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.960]   with software.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.440]   Yeah, they do that.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.120]   It's something you see a lot more in the gaming world,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.640]   like licensed accessories.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.400]   But Apple started doing this.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.880]   And so they had made-for-ipod.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.000]   And then when the iPhone came out and the iPad came out,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.800]   they did made-for-ipod.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.000]   And now the program is called MFI, made-for-ipod, whatever.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.960]   And it's actually a really cool program for them,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.680]   because they don't have to go through the work of creating
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.560]   a whole line of accessories.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.520]   But they get to take basically a chunk of profit
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.600]   from anybody who creates an Apple accessory
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.680]   and gets the license--
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.640]   gets the Apple license.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.080]   And then if Apple really likes your accessory,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.440]   they're going to carry it in the store.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.800]   And then they're taking both the license fee for the accessory,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.400]   as well as some of the margin off of the actual cost of the sale.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.840]   So Apple kind of double dips on it.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.400]   But most accessories companies really like this,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.440]   because they make less money, but they sell more units.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   So if you think about it getting in the Apple store
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   is a huge retail opportunity.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.560]   Absolutely.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.160]   If you make Apple accessories, there's nothing
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.080]   you want more than to be in the Apple store,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.360]   even despite the fact that Apple is double dipping
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.480]   on your profits.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.680]   And so my whole story with the iPhone cases comes in
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.320]   is if you look at what cases have become available
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.400]   on the Apple store this week, and there were no cases available
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.440]   for the last couple of months.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.480]   And now cases are just starting to become available right
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.640]   around the same time I publish this story.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.840]   You'll notice that there are no slide on cases.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.280]   But actually, I might have an example.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.320]   I don't have one handy right now.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.520]   But it's any kind of case where you put the iPhone into it
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.640]   and it slides in.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.320]   And basically what I'd heard--
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.120]   So this is an example of such a case.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.320]   And I bought this at the AT&T store.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.480]   This is the iFrogs.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.560]   So it slides on here and then the bottom slides on there.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.360]   And frankly, this is what I've been using.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.080]   It does the same thing as the bumper case,
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.320]   but it also protects the back.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:17.880]   Right.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.080]   And I also have a Mophie Juice Pack Air
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.480]   does the same thing, slides on.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.400]   So there are a lot of cases that do this.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.080]   And some of them are actually licensed.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.640]   The Juice Pack Air, I think, is licensed in.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.440]   I think the Duracell one is a licensed accessory.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.880]   But Apple is not selling them.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.920]   And Apple does sell the Juice Pack Air for other products
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.320]   as well.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.280]   And they sell slide-on cases for their other iPhones,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   for the 3G and the 3G.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.040]   That's not for the 4.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.960]   But not for the 4.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.360]   And there's a reason why.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.640]   But before I get to that, I mean,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.800]   when you look at the other cases, you
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.120]   see that the other ones don't have this mechanism where
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.000]   it slides onto the phone.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.360]   They have some kind of mechanism where it snaps on
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.640]   or in the case of the bumper, it goes on the edge of the phone
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.960]   and kind of flips onto place.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.240]   And the reason being what I heard from a source who's
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.160]   given me very reliable information from Apple for many years
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   and then which I also confirmed from a very large third party
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.840]   accessories manufacturer independently
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.600]   was that Apple has kind of gone into lockdown.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.400]   And right after Antennagate, they
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.680]   were basically looking for issues.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.640]   They were trying to find anything else that could blow up
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.280]   in their face.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.080]   We don't need another hit on this platform, in other words.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.600]   Right.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   We don't want to give consumer reports
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.040]   anymore an ammunition.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.720]   Absolutely.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.360]   Absolutely.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.040]   And what they discovered was the slide on cases,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.720]   if there's grit or any kind of matter
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.680]   in between the back of the case and the case
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.520]   as it's sliding on, the back of the phone and the case
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.280]   as it's sliding on, it can scratch and score the glass, which
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.000]   can turn into a fracture or a crack.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.520]   So this one, this iFrog's case, has some velveteen in there.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.560]   But I mean, you could still get some gravel in there.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.280]   I mean, I don't know how you would.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.920]   So what you're saying is really more than just the case
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.840]   is that if this so-called Gorilla Glass back is scored,
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.880]   that might be sufficient to turn into a fracture on the back.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.400]   Right.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.960]   I mean, it's glass.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960]   It's--
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.360]   Isn't it an ex-toughton glass?
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:20.720]   It is.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.880]   It's a tough and glass.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.280]   It's a tough and glass is not Gorilla Glass.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   Gorilla Glass is made by Corning.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.000]   But it is a strengthened composite glass,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.760]   very similar to Gorilla Glass.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's stronger than the front, though, isn't it?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.080]   The back?
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.520]   No, I believe they're actually the same material,
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.000]   the same kind of glass.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Interesting.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.500]   OK.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.920]   But they-- it's glass, and it scores, and it cracks,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.600]   and it shatters.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.520]   And a lot of people--
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.960]   You know what's interesting to me about this?
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.800]   What?
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.720]   I've never heard of such a thing as scratches
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.360]   on any of these devices.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.080]   You're being facetious.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.840]   In fact, this is a big problem Apple got sued
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.760]   because the iPod was so easy to scratch,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.360]   one of the iPod models.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   But this is more important than just a scratch.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.120]   This is not merely cosmetic because if it fractures,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   you could have a break.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.040]   Is that what you're talking about, Ryan?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.320]   I mean, when they do fracture, it's not like all the glass
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.040]   comes apart.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.200]   I mean, it's kind of like the safety glass in a car,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.080]   where if it sustains an acute impact,
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.760]   it's not all just going to fall out.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.440]   I mean, it does hold together.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   But you will not necessarily wind up
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.320]   with a fractured back.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.120]   But if you do wind up with a fractured back,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.600]   it's going to look like a piece of shattered glass on the back.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.240]   And so what Apple is concerned about
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.400]   is basically that you would buy a case,
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.880]   and Apple had licensed some slide on third-party cases,
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.800]   that you would buy a slide on case, you would put it on,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.600]   and you're a diligent customer.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.800]   You want to take care of your phone.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.000]   You want to put it in a case.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.680]   So you buy the Apple license case from potentially the Apple
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:53.880]   store.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.240]   It could be somewhere else.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.120]   And then maybe a month later, you take it off,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.160]   and you find that your phone, which you've taken great care of,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.080]   has been cracked on the back.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.080]   So what Apple did was they kind of went into lockdown on this.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.480]   What does that mean when you say, "win in the lockdown?"
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.240]   So they started a test lab specifically for testing this.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.600]   And they started investigating this very thoroughly.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.520]   And then they also basically completely
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.880]   wiped the store clear of any slide on cases.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   So that's why you can--
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.480]   The proof of this is that you couldn't buy a slide on.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.440]   You still to this day--
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.160]   You can't buy a slide on case.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.600]   You can't buy a slide on case just for the full--
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.120]   Not from Apple.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.960]   You can buy them.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.200]   And they're out there.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.080]   And I'm sure that this concerns them.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   But you cannot buy a slide on case right now from Apple.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.200]   Now, I guess the online store is selling it.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.400]   Is the online store selling some?
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.320]   The online store just this week, I think,
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.640]   actually the day before I published this story,
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.440]   just put their cases back online.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.520]   And the funny thing about this story is that I had the story--
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.040]   I've been sitting on it for a couple of weeks.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.400]   And I've been talking to people and trying
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.760]   to build the evidence I thought that was necessary to publish
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.720]   this with the requisite credibility,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.600]   because Apple's stories are obviously
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.440]   subject to a lot of scrutiny.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.360]   And I reached out to Apple and asked for a comment.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.880]   And again, their store had had zero cases, no iPhone cases,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.000]   for weeks.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.400]   And then in the time that I did that,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.920]   and about 36 hours later, when I published the story,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.920]   a bunch of iPhone cases went back up on the site.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.800]   You think this is a response to you?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.600]   I don't necessarily think that it's in response.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:39.480]   But it was pretty funny timing, because I happen to have reached out.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   And granted, I reached out in early October.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.400]   I mean, I had expected them to put some of these cases back
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.680]   online anyway, because the free case program ended on September 30.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.800]   But it was just very, very bizarre timing.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.720]   And actually, I think kind of worked in my favor,
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.440]   because like you said, you go to look at the accessories
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:58.920]   that they sell.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.040]   There's no slide on cases.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.320]   And there are slide on cases for the iPhone 3G and 3GS.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.000]   And there are all kinds of slide on accessories
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   for those phones.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.560]   And we also know, of course, that you
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.320]   can buy slide on accessories for the iPhone 4.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.920]   But Apple is not selling any of them.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.960]   They're completely off the site.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.200]   Well, why would they put it back on the website?
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.760]   Is it-- I mean, if they're dangerous,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.800]   why are they selling this spec case?
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.000]   Well, so the cases that they are selling on the site
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   right now are not slide ons.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.200]   They are the snap off.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.800]   OK.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.440]   So the core of the issue is that--
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.560]   You still can't buy a slide on case anywhere from Apple.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.120]   Exactly.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.400]   The core of the issue is if there's
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.000]   like some grit on the back of the phone or inside the case,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.240]   which definitely have--
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.760]   Scratching.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.880]   --that it's the sliding motion that scratches it
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.120]   and begins the fracture.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.400]   So you published this in GDGT a few days ago.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.800]   What's the response been from your readers?
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.040]   Have they confirmed this?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.880]   Or is this not very likely?
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.000]   Well, one of the things that I put out there--
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.960]   and I tried to be really clear about this--
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.320]   is that it's preemptive.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.440]   I don't think that this is a massive epidemic issue right
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.400]   now.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.760]   And I think that most people probably agree with that.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.480]   And I think that that's in large part to Apple
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.200]   trying to contain this as quickly and as early as possible.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.760]   I think that if everybody out there was getting--
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.560]   and you also noticed that in the free case program,
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.600]   there were no slide on cases.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.680]   They were all snap on cases.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.000]   I think that if there were tens or hundreds of thousands
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.080]   of slide on cases out there, that this might be a bigger deal.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   But Apple, I think, is doing everything they can
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.960]   to prevent that from happening.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.120]   So I think they're doing their job.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.480]   I mean, they're doing a good job at containing this.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:49.960]   And my goal here was not to try to scare people into buying
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.520]   cases or something like that or not buying cases, but really
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.000]   just to inform people as to what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.800]   Very interesting.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.280]   So if you have a slide on case, which I do,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.040]   is your recommendation to retire it?
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.920]   You know what I actually did?
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.320]   I have a slide on case that I've been using for a little while.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.000]   I haven't had any problems with it yet.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.760]   What I would recommend is if you have a screen protector,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.360]   put the screen protector on the back of the phone
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   in between the phone and the slide on case.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.720]   And that should help.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.080]   OK.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.600]   That would be my first recommendation.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.800]   gdgt.com.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.920]   If you want to read more on this story,
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.040]   and there's about 84 comments in there,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.800]   some people have had this problem.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.280]   Some have not.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.320]   The fact that anybody has seems like, you're right.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.520]   You put a case on it to protect it.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.480]   If it's going to scratch it, that's not such a good thing.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.920]   And if it's going to fracture it, that's really not a good thing.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.400]   Thank you, Ryan.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:38.800]   Thanks.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.040]   Ryan Block, gdgt.com.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.880]   We're going to take a little break, come back with more
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.560]   John C. Devorex here, Tom Merritt.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.680]   And John Graham, coming.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   We're going to talk a little bit about the analytic engine
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.400]   of Charles Babbage, a big anniversary today.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.560]   Before we do that, though, I'd like
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.920]   to mention our friends at Citrix who do the fabulous go-to meeting,
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.240]   go-to meeting, reduces costs, improves efficiencies,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.280]   makes your meetings come alive.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.840]   It's the best web conferencing solution by far.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.080]   And if you haven't tried it yet, I
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:18.240]   want to give you a free 30 days to try it at go-to meeting.com/twit.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.560]   It's the easiest to use, easiest to install.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.120]   Your attendees don't even have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.960]   This is one of the things Citrix does so well.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.160]   You send them a link in an email, or you can even
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.280]   be on a conference call and say, hey, this is ridiculous.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.600]   Why don't I just show you what I'm talking about?
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.640]   You tell your conferees to go-to meeting.com.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.960]   You give them the meeting ID, they enter that.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.840]   There's a little download, a little stub of a download.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.120]   It's got to take about 30 seconds.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.040]   And boom, they are now seeing your computer screen
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.600]   on their computer.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.000]   They can share their screen with you.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.800]   You can have up to 15 attendees.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.080]   It's great for product reviews, for sales presentations,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.600]   training sessions, collaboration.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.480]   Just taking a conference call from a boring old phone
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.640]   call to something exciting and visual.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.240]   We use it all the time here at the Twit.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.840]   We have several accounts, because we're constantly using this.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.760]   I want you to try it free.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.040]   30 days, go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.840]   We thank the folks at Citrix for their support of this week
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.440]   in tech.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.200]   John, John, John, John, I don't know why John does that,
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.920]   but he likes to cover up the screen when
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320]   we're doing a commercial.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.240]   Are you embarrassed to be associated with a money-making
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:28.720]   enterprise?
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.520]   Is that it, John?
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.040]   If I leave to go based my meat, I don't want people
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.280]   spying on the room.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.640]   Who knows what they might see?
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.400]   I'm sorry, Rycon, stick around, because there's actually
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.080]   some really interesting stuff going on this week.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.200]   Boy, couldn't he stick around?
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.080]   He could have stuck around.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.520]   No, he can't.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.400]   He couldn't.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.560]   But I thought--
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.400]   I don't know.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.280]   He had to base his meat.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:52.960]   I don't know.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.360]   But he had something else to do.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.160]   He very kindly agreed to come on--
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.760]   well, actually, before we move on, I guess,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.560]   I take it just watching the chatroom.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.240]   You had some skepticism about this whole thing.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.320]   No, I just think-- no, I didn't.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.480]   But let me just say this.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.640]   I think you should have at least invited him to stay.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.160]   No, I did.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.600]   We invited him to stay before the show.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.960]   And he said he couldn't.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.080]   And I said, can you please come on for five minutes
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.200]   and at least talk about this?
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.480]   Because it was a big story.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.160]   So he agreed to take some time.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.000]   It's Sunday.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.120]   He's probably watching the ball game.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.480]   By the way, what you want to watch--
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.680]   you don't want to watch any ball games.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.120]   You want to watch the red show.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.560]   Red zone, I know.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.600]   This is the direct TV thing, huh?
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.360]   No, no, it sounds dish network, too.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.600]   Dish has a two.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.880]   I have to say, I'm tempted to get a dish--
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.200]   a dish dish because of this Google TV.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.440]   Because it's the only DVR that works with the Google TV.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.920]   The dish network dish?
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.840]   Yeah, the TV--
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.040]   They're building it into the set top box.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.840]   In other words.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.040]   So the DVR that comes with a dish dish
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.600]   is supported on the Logitech review.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.280]   Oh, cool.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:04.720]   So you--
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.840]   So if you have-- you can say in your Android phone,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.640]   your iPhone, you can say Hawaii 5.0.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.120]   And it will not only find Hawaii 5.0 on your program
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.960]   guide on the internet, if you can watch it on the internet.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.680]   On various stores.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.480]   But it will also, if you have DVR recordings of Hawaii 5.0,
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.920]   we'll find it there as well.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.960]   But that's not a feature.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.720]   That's not a feature.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   Have you ever seen that show?
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.840]   Yes.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   John has a point.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.880]   John has a point.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.920]   Why would you want that?
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   All right.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.440]   All righty.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.120]   All righty.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.440]   All righty.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.200]   Should we move on to another story?
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.920]   Or should we go on about this?
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.760]   Anybody have anything to say about this iPhone case thing?
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.160]   Well, I was in the chat room.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.280]   And the chat room was going crazy about how this was not
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.040]   a story.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.560]   I think the blogosphere has echoed it a little stronger
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.480]   than it probably deserves.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.600]   But I think it's worth paying attention to.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.520]   If you have one of these cases like you do, Leo,
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.040]   you should know.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.880]   Like, hey, there's a risk of breaking in there.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.720]   I do agree that I don't think it's a big controversy
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.960]   that Apple is going to have to come out with another press
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.720]   conference, and it's going to kill iPhone sales
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.560]   or anything like that.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.360]   I think it's just kind of more of a consumer awareness issue.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.960]   Yes.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.440]   Well, we certainly gave it all-- we led with it.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.360]   So maybe their problem is--
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.600]   And I only led with it because--
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.280]   Because you couldn't keep Ryan on the whole show.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.360]   Ryan had to go.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.520]   No.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.880]   No.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.120]   He's good on this regular show.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.200]   I love Ryan.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.760]   Ryan's great.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.480]   He does a show on GDGT.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.200]   And I would have loved to have kept him.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.720]   He'll be back.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.080]   Well, he'll have him back next week or next time he's available.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.680]   Next time there's not a big game or he's not
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.080]   watching the Red Zone or whatever.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.880]   The Red Zone is all the--
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.480]   I read somewhere that if you actually time it out,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.400]   there's only about four minutes of action in an NFL game.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:58.880]   Literally.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.080]   That's why the Red Zone's so good.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.880]   And it's not even all the action, just the stuff
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.360]   within the 20 yards of the end zone.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   Is that it?
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.200]   John Graham, coming.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.800]   Are you very confused, Riley?
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.120]   That's the main idea, is that they just show you
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   what's going on in the Red Zone on all the games
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.320]   at the same time.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.000]   But they'll show you other stuff.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Like if somebody throws a long bomb or something,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.760]   it doesn't make it to the Red Zone, they'll still show it.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.800]   John, in the UK, do they have something similar for cricket
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.840]   matches or anything?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.120]   Actually, I was thinking exactly that, which is the cricket,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.600]   of course, is completely the opposite.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.200]   It takes about three weeks to play.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.520]   It involves having cups of tea every few hours.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.400]   So the controls couldn't be great yet.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.320]   I don't even know how they score.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.480]   It's six ups and four outs and 10 runs.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.160]   And in fact, there's a variety of numbers.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.400]   And I don't know what number has to be the highest for you
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.320]   to actually win a game.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.400]   Well, actually, almost nobody knows that.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.560]   You know, I think what actually happens is at the end of it,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.000]   they decide who had the best tea.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.760]   And then they, that's the one who wins the game.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.720]   I don't understand.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.400]   It's like that game in the Fantastic Mr. Fox whack bat,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.000]   which actually reminds me a lot of cricket.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.880]   So I have a question, Leo.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.760]   Yes, John.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.360]   Are we going to get to any news stories today?
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   We're just wondering, it's not like I'm complaining.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.160]   Who brought up the red zone?
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.280]   Thank you, Tom Merritt, defending me, defending my honor.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.240]   Too shame, Mr. Merritt.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.600]   Ew.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.400]   So you want to talk about Google Cars?
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   Google's-- Oh, yeah, these self-driving cars are pretty cool.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.880]   Autonomous vehicles, the article in The New York Times.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.800]   Google Cars drive themselves in traffic.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.280]   I wonder if there's an ice cream truck with the Eric Schmidt
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.320]   not driving.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.800]   The idea behind this, Dimitri Dolgoff,
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.400]   is a Google engineer.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.080]   I just do it because I can do a Russian accent.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.000]   Google Goff.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.400]   He's a Google Goff.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.520]   Is it driving?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.200]   Well, no, I guess they put an engineer in there
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.320]   just in case it crashes.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.280]   Well, to make it legal, to make it strictly legal,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.960]   that would be funnier.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   Just put a dog behind the wheel.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.800]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.680]   Have an engineer.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.840]   So if you're driving-- now, see, I've driven highway one
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.800]   between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.680]   It is a twisty, crazy, scary road.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.080]   And if I were to see a Toyota Prius with a curious funnel
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.920]   like cylinder on the roof and no one at the wheel,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.880]   I think I would freak out.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.520]   Well, they have to put somebody at the wheel.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.920]   So that's why nobody was freaking out,
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.600]   because I couldn't tell he wasn't driving it.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.000]   But to actually make it street legal,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.760]   they did some look at the rules of the road in California
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   and found out that you can have automatic systems as long
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.520]   as there's somebody there monitoring them.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.840]   So they had an engineer who could turn off
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.680]   the automatic driving by hitting the brake pedal
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.560]   by speaking a word in one other way.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.760]   And they said they only had to actually do that half a dozen
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.520]   times on this long trip.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.720]   1,000 miles these cars have driven without a driver.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.280]   The rotating cone on the top is called LiDAR.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.760]   It's a sensor on the roof that scans more than 200 feet
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.120]   in all directions to generate--
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   For lies.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.720]   For lying radar.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.920]   To generate a precise three dimensional map
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.960]   of the car's surroundings, it then
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.760]   has four automotive radar sensors, three in front and one
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.720]   in the back, to determine the positions of distant objects.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.600]   It has a position estimator, a sensor on the left rear wheel,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.320]   which measures movements made by the car.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.120]   I guess it's giving you kind of a dead reckoning.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.200]   There's also a video camera in the front windshield
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.400]   near the rear view mirror that's detecting traffic lights.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   And then there's computers.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.880]   And all this for less than a quarter of a million dollars.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.120]   I want one.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.720]   It says seven test cars have driven 1,000 miles
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.880]   without human intervention and more than 140,000 miles
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.000]   with only occasional human control.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.840]   They even went down Lombard Street,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.040]   which is the twistiest street in the world in San Francisco.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.960]   The only accident was when one car was rear ended
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.200]   while stopped at a traffic light.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.600]   It wasn't even the car's fault.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.040]   And they also said a lot of the time
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   when they had to go ahead time.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.520]   I say a couple of times when they had to take control
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.400]   was because a bicyclist actually ran a red light
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.200]   in front of them and it was harder for the car to see that.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.560]   Which reminds me.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:23.960]   Yes.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.720]   Bicyclists are doing this all the time.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.040]   Why aren't they stopped and sighted?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.680]   They would be if the cop is all them.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.720]   At least in California, bicyclists
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.640]   has to obey the same rules of the road that a car does,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.160]   including stop signs and red lights.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.440]   Never seen it.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.240]   Well, it'll be solved by the Google cars,
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.400]   which will just run straight into them and kill them all.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.920]   That's right.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.480]   It's Darwinian.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.600]   So what were you going to say, John, about these Google cars?
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.840]   I was wondering if they can drive on the left.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.200]   Oh, you know, it's that kind of thing you're right.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.760]   Probably nobody's really thought about.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.080]   I actually have a funny story about this,
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.640]   which is I met the guy who ran one of the DARPA challenge
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.920]   projects, the Stanford Racing one that won it
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.840]   through the desert at Nevada,
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.520]   called Sven Stroband.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.600]   And he told me that the way they ensured software quality
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.160]   was when a software engineer said, my module is ready,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.040]   he said, great, we'll put you in the car.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.480]   And basically, they had to go in the car for a few hours.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.440]   How ready are you?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.560]   And he said, no one ever failed to say,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.120]   you know, I could do it an extra week.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   We'll strap you to the bumper of the car.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.360]   How about that?
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.640]   So this is-- you know, look.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.320]   This is not technology that's going
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.600]   to be on the roads of the US in the next few years.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.480]   But it's something we've been talking about for a long time.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.520]   And in the theory of autonomous vehicles,
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:52.400]   they would be safer because a lot of accidents are human error.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.320]   Yes?
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.800]   It's funny you brought up Stanford, John,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.920]   because one of the guys that oversaw Stanley,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.040]   the DARPA car that did this, is one of the guys
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.640]   that's doing this for Google on contract.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.520]   And it's kind of a surprising leap to hear
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.400]   that we went from a total failure, the first DARPA grand
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:20.320]   challenge, to a successful, yet very restricted, test,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.080]   to somebody taking a car just out on the public street
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.240]   and having it drive itself.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.360]   I mean, it's expensive.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.960]   It's far ahead.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.720]   But this could save thousands and thousands of lives
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.360]   and save a bunch of time, too, if it actually works.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.800]   I remember talking-- I wish I could remember
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.640]   to his name-- to a researcher in this autonomous car
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:40.960]   thing.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.520]   And he had this amazing kind of vision,
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.720]   not only of a safety, but of efficiency.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.960]   Imagine, he said, that no one owns a car.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.280]   But that it's kind of like the zip car idea,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.200]   that when you need a car, one arrives.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.520]   And that, for instance, you order a car.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.160]   Car arrives.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.600]   Takes you to where you're going and then disappears.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.760]   And let's say you need an RV.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.280]   Instead of buying an RV, you take the car to where you're
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.800]   going, and RV is already waiting for you there.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.240]   You get in the RV, you sleep, you spend the night, whatever.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.880]   And then you go on.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.920]   In other words, it's just in time cars.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.120]   And he said this would save us a lot of fuel, of time,
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.040]   of efficiency.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.920]   So Leo, you're telling me you lost your Ford sponsorship?
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   No, no, no.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.520]   I think Ford--
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.000]   Well, then why are you promoting such an idea?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.800]   Ford is right in the forefront of this, as a matter of fact.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.200]   You saw the YouTube video of me crashing my explorer.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   I did--
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.560]   Good work.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.200]   No, actually it was a flex.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.080]   I was in a Ford Flex.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.160]   It was on the Ford test track.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.360]   I think I was wearing a helmet at the time.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.400]   And they want to show me the auto park feature, which is--
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.080]   I asked these guys.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.000]   I said, of course, we can do this in a much grander scale.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.680]   But in fact, I asked Alan Malawi, the CEO of Ford,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.600]   he says, people like to drive.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.400]   So we're not going to take the wheel out of their hands.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.160]   I think so.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.960]   And by the way, I want to tell people out there,
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.520]   because I don't think a lot of people know this.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.280]   But Leo actually drives around all the time with a helmet.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.720]   It's weird.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.680]   Required to by state law.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.840]   He walks around with it, too.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.120]   Well, that was after the injury I had to, because I have--
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.000]   this is not commonly known, but the fontanel that
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.200]   normally children have, babies have,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.560]   where there's a soft spot where their brain is exposed.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.480]   And it closes up as you grow mine never did.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:27.920]   So--
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.640]   No one away.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.000]   If I were to be struck right here on my head--
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.600]   don't push.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.040]   Or even to push, I would blackout.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.720]   And if you struck me hard enough, my brain would turn to jelly.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.360]   It's like a killies heel in your head.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.520]   Exactly.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.360]   You just gave Roy your cryptonite right there.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.200]   That is my cryptonite.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.640]   It's the only way I can be stocked.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.320]   Jason Calicanis is making notes right now.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.560]   He's drilling a hole in his head, as a matter of fact.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.080]   So this is the 173rd annual anniversary
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.440]   of the invention of the analytical machine.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.120]   And this man knows a little bit about it,
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.040]   because he wrote the geek atlas, which includes places
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.000]   to go for geeks around the world, including the babbages.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.320]   What is it?
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.880]   Has house, the analytical machine itself?
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.080]   What can we see?
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.000]   So let me set you right on one thing.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.160]   It's not a very wonderful anniversary today.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.080]   The real point is that no one built Babbage's computer.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   There is no analytical machine.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.520]   It was never made.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.960]   It was never made, although bits have all made.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.400]   And so what I'm trying to do is build it, which
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   is quite a large machine.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.080]   It's about the size of a small truck.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.320]   And so I started a project to do the research necessary
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.120]   to finish it.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.360]   And it'll have about 1.7 k of memory made out of brass,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.720]   essentially, and powered by a steam engine.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.360]   Now, what is the difference between the analytical engine
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.240]   and the different sensors?
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.560]   Is that just two words for the same thing,
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.360]   or are they two different things?
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.400]   So the difference engine, just basically what it does
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.320]   is it calculates polynomials.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.120]   So it's a calculator.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.840]   It does one thing.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.800]   The analytical engine is a programmable computer.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   It had memory, actually quite expandable memory.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.040]   At some points, Babbage thought you
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.400]   might need up to 20k of memory.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.440]   It has a CPU, which is separate from the memory.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.080]   Whereas the difference engine, it's all mixed together.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.880]   And it was programmed using punch cards.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.120]   So it was very similar.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   And it even has microcode like in a modern microprocessor.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.600]   Wow.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.080]   And even, actually, most amazingly,
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.440]   it has instruction pipelining like in a risk processor.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.640]   Just the whole thing is completely mechanical.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.240]   And that's a lot of plans.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.320]   This is a good kind of fascinates me.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.160]   By the way, and I hope you actually do this.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.880]   But have you thought about the history in so far
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.160]   is why nobody has actually tried to build one of these before?
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.360]   Because we have a lot of billionaires that are techy nerds
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.000]   out there that have got more than enough money to finance
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.200]   something like this.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.240]   And they could have done it 20 years ago.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.520]   And is there been any attempts?
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.720]   Or is there a history behind this?
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.840]   Because it's always baffled me that nobody's tried to--
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.720]   or has actually built one by now.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.760]   So I hope the billionaires are listening.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.360]   Because I need about a million dollars.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.240]   Is that expensive?
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.640]   Wow.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.840]   Well, it'll be expensive for one really big reason, which
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.800]   is we built Babbage's different engine.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.920]   There's a copy in the Computer History Museum Mountain View.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.000]   Because Babbage laid out complete plans.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.040]   So it was possible to just go get the plans out
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.360]   of the Science Museum in London and essentially build it.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.080]   The analytical engine, much like with any other computer,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.000]   he kept improving it.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.600]   So there's a whole load of plans.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.200]   And every now and then he optimizes some bit of it,
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.600]   making multiplication faster, or addition pipe lining,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.840]   all these things.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.160]   So there's not one definitive set.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.600]   And I think the big reason people haven't built it yet
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.240]   is there's actually a research project to do, which is to say,
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.400]   all right, look, what are these plans actually
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.160]   constitutes the analytical engine?
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.360]   And once you do that, then you can decide to build it.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.160]   So this is the different engine.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   And this was the source of my confusion.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.400]   I didn't realize it was a difference.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.280]   I've seen this.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   This is local.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.880]   So basically in the late '80s, the Science Museum in London
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.800]   built the difference engine.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.920]   And it's all cogs and brass wheels.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.800]   I mean, it's beautiful.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.600]   Yes.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.880]   It's absolutely beautiful.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.920]   And the point of doing that was to show that, first of all,
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.320]   Babaj's machines would have worked.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.040]   And also that the technology available to the Victorians
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.240]   was good enough, because they built this to the tolerances
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.480]   that were available in Victorians,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.560]   but with alloys that were available.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.720]   So the point is that took away all of the uncertainty
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.480]   about whether Babaj's machines could have been built.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.440]   And so now what we want to do is say, OK,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.360]   let's decide what the analytical engine was,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.040]   and let's build it, and then let's program it.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.320]   So this is a big-- this is just a big calculator.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.600]   You're talking about building the first computer, really.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.120]   Yes.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.800]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.080]   It is a general purpose, Turing complete.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.120]   It has loops.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.280]   It has all the things you recognize in a computer.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.600]   It has a printer.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.160]   And for graphical output, it has a plotter.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.840]   Wow.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.240]   And it runs on crank, then.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.160]   Same as the--
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.680]   Steam.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.080]   Steam.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.680]   Yeah, OK.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.400]   But it is in other words, it's--
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.720]   There's no electricity in it.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.320]   It's--
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   No.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.520]   No, there's no evidence, actually, that Babaj ever
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.120]   considered using electricity for any of his computers.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.760]   He was a contemporary of Faraday,
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.440]   so there was work going on with electricity at the time.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.120]   But he was completely thinking about mechanical devices,
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.360]   powered by Steam.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.880]   The most fascinating thing for me is he believed
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.560]   in his lifetime it wouldn't be built,
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.000]   because essentially he was working alone.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.920]   And he nevertheless wrote that one day someone's
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.360]   going to build one of these analytical engines,
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   I a computer.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.880]   And it's going to shape the course of science forever.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.320]   And I think that's quite amazing.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.720]   He was sitting there in 1847, saying, once this is built,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.160]   it's all going to change.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.560]   I can see it coming.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.040]   Who was Charles Babaj?
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.520]   I mean, how did he get this vision?
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.120]   He was a mathematician.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.000]   He was fairly wealthy, because his father was a banker,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.200]   and he inherited a lot of money.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.280]   He was a minor aristocracy in Britain.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.040]   And so he was the case in Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.200]   He was a very good mathematician.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.600]   And he got the idea, because at the time,
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.720]   it was necessary to print books of tables, log tables,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.640]   some of your old enough to use in log tables.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.800]   And they were full of inaccuracies
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.520]   because people would make mistakes.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.640]   And Babaj said, "All this ought to be done by Steam.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.440]   Everything from the calculation to the printing."
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.880]   So there's no room for error.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.760]   And he built that.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.120]   That machine is the difference engine,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.960]   which you can see in Mountain View.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.800]   The printer even does text justification.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.520]   So I mean, go look at it, because it's stunning.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.560]   But while he was working on this, he said,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.880]   actually, I think there's more I can do
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.840]   if I can get feedback in the system.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.800]   And the feedback is what led him to the computer.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.240]   And that's what led him to the analytical engine.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.480]   How did Ada Loveless get involved in this?
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.960]   So she was, of course, Lord Byron's daughter.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.480]   Well, one of his children,
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.880]   the legitimate one, at least.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.800]   And she had some mathematical training.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.360]   Babaj, because he was a member of high society in Britain,
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.200]   had parties at his house, where he would demonstrate bits
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.000]   of the difference engine.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.240]   So he really was a nerd, in my opinion.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.720]   I'm kidding.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.520]   Can you imagine me inviting him out to his house
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.200]   with the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, Prince Albert?
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.560]   Let's turn this.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.040]   And in fact, the bit that he demonstrated
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.240]   is in the science museum in London.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.640]   And every time I go, look at it, I think,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.480]   this is what the guy showed up at parties.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.520]   Luckily, he was wealthy enough that people came.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.720]   Ada Loveless was one of those people.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.600]   She became fascinated by the analytical engine.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.120]   And she translated a paper, the only really good paper,
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.600]   that was published at the time, which was published in French.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.960]   She translated it into English.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.240]   And that's really where we get her name associated with it,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.520]   because she added to that paper pages of notes
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.760]   from her own thinking about the analytical engine.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.840]   So you're trying to raise £500,000 pounds,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.080]   about a million dollars, to build this?
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.160]   So, yes, I'm trying to raise about--
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.840]   I'm trying to get 50,000 people to say they'll put up $10
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.360]   pounds or euros, depending on what your currency is,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.240]   to kick it off.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.600]   It is going to probably need more.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.080]   We know from the cost of the difference engine,
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.320]   the difference engine cost about £400,000.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.600]   And this has got some research behind it.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.120]   But I think that one of the goals
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.600]   will be actually to digitize all the beverages papers,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.720]   because they're not available on the web.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.760]   And they're in the Science Museum in London.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.000]   And so this is really an educational thing,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.120]   as well as ultimately trying to build this computer
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.840]   and show that in 1837, Babbage had invented
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.080]   a general purpose digital computer with a printer,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.280]   a plotter, punch cards, microcode,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.680]   instruction pipeline, and you name it.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.720]   And it's kind of amazing that it's 100 years later,
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.800]   in 1937, that you had Alan Turing, who
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.480]   wrote his famous paper in which he laid out the Turing machine.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.720]   And so part of what I'm saying is there's 100 years
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.960]   here that were sort of lost.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.360]   And it's fascinating.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.920]   I was going to ask you one question.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.600]   After you finish doing this steam-powered computer,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.840]   are you going to go one more step and do a steam-powered internet?
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.760]   Wasn't that a Stevenson book kind of along those lines?
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.920]   Well, I can be actually.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.280]   I have the Victorian internet somewhere here.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.840]   I mean, that actually is a whole other interesting thing,
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.480]   which is the telegraph and how that operated in this era.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   So the era that Babbage was working,
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.560]   not long after that, because the British Empire was very big,
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.880]   and you keep the British Empire in control with telegraph.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.080]   It was possible to telegraph a message from London to Bombay
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.760]   in the middle of the 1800s in eight minutes, which
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   makes you think the internet now.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.200]   I mean, it's only a little bit faster than that.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:18.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.000]   A little bit.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.040]   I think it's interesting that the Turing machine was never built
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.320]   either.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.960]   A lot of these were kind of mental exercises more than--
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.560]   although I guess Babbage expected it to be built at some point.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.880]   Now, there's a huge distinction, right,
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.160]   which is that Babbage was building something practical.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.000]   He saw real use of it.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.800]   Turing was laying down the fundamentals of computer science.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.160]   So for me, Babbage is a computer pioneer
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   and Turing a computer science pioneer.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.480]   So they're doing slightly different things.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:45.960]   That makes sense.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.440]   Of course, the interesting thing is, looking back,
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.320]   Babbage's machine was Turing completely.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.240]   It was a computer that we would recognize.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.120]   He'd already done that thinking, hadn't he?
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.960]   He hadn't realized that there was only one Turing-ness.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   But yeah, he'd built it.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.360]   Wow.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.000]   Now, this is the ultimate steampunk project.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.120]   I mean, there's nothing not steampunk about it.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.480]   It's pure awesome.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.800]   This is the ultimate steampunk project.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.400]   And I will probably have to start dressing up in Victorian clothing
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.000]   if I get the--
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.520]   You will.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   It's a sad fact.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.320]   But yeah, you will.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.640]   The top patent goggles are on their way.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.920]   If people want to pledge--
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.640]   now, you've only got 101 pledges.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.160]   I'm going to pledge some money into this as well.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.040]   In fact, I'll tell you what.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.640]   You've got 101 people donating $10.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.960]   Why don't I just double that and put it
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.920]   another $10 in there?
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.360]   At least you'll be a little bit closer.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.880]   You need 50,000 people to make this happen.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.400]   So I may be throwing--
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.120]   well, I guess I don't pay anything unless you get the 50,000.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.880]   Are you using Kickstarter for this or something else?
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.720]   Actually, I'm not using Kickstarter because Kickstarter only
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.800]   accepts if you have a US bank account.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.600]   I'm using a thing called Pledge Bank, which
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.520]   is very similar and it operates worldwide.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.960]   It's a very similar idea.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.560]   The only difference is you don't actually
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.640]   have to give you a credit card number or anything.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.360]   It's just literally a, I'm willing to do this.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.760]   And the reason I picked 50,000 is that when I did the Alan
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.600]   Turing apology petition last year--
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.720]   Which you succeeded in.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.480]   Yes, I did.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.040]   Yes.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.400]   I got 35,000 people in Britain to sign that.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.160]   So this project is worldwide.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.360]   So I'm betting that I have a good chance of getting 50,000
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.400]   people to say, yes, $10 is enough to go and see a truck
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.080]   size steam powered brass computer.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.720]   Well, if we have enough people listening that if only say 20%
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.880]   of the people listening donated, I think you'd be there.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.320]   So everybody get out and do it.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.120]   That sounds fantastic.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:49.800]   Go to a John site, which is jgc.org.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.240]   Donorg.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:50.880]   It is.org.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.320]   And you can see under my blog, there's a link on the right
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.160]   hand side there where it says Pledge.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.880]   It's in a hideous purple color.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.720]   You can't miss it under the blogs.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.280]   And then I just signed up at Pledge Bank.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.800]   And I guess Pledge Bank doesn't give you an opportunity
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.640]   to say how much you're pledging.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.240]   What you can do if you want to be public and say, hey, I'm
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.120]   willing to give more.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   Because somebody has said that.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.760]   There's actually a comment section where you can say, I'll
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.960]   give you $100 or whatever you feel like so.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.120]   So I'm going to put a thousand in.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.880]   Because I really want you to do this.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.200]   But I have one request is that we get to cover live the
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.800]   switch flip.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.000]   Well, I want to--
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.240]   here's what I've been thinking about.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.120]   I wonder what this thing sounds like when it boots.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.680]   Oh, can you imagine?
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.400]   Why would it sound like when it crashes?
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.520]   When it crashes.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.400]   It literally exactly crashes.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.080]   No, we'll put a thousand in and it will raise money.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:45.960]   I want to get this going.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.480]   I think this is a great project.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.360]   It's perfect for the 173 of the batch analytical machine.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.600]   I mean, what better time to do it?
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.680]   And I'm glad to put some money in.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.200]   And we would love to cover the process of building
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.800]   and I know it's all the way in London.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.880]   But I think this is great.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.800]   And if there are any millionaires listening, you could just
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.400]   cut to the chase right now.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.760]   Yeah, we'll just get it done tomorrow.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.560]   Get on with it.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.520]   So just imagine what a great museum piece this would make.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.600]   And also the important side of it, there's also this very
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.360]   much research educational side to it.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.760]   It's not just a folly of let's build a massive brass machine.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.120]   I do want to do that bit.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.920]   But we have to understand what Babid really was saying and do
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.520]   the research.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.160]   So I'm looking forward to it.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:27.160]   Good.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.280]   Nothing to knock folly.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.480]   Let me tell you.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.360]   I would never discourage anyone's folly.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.600]   So go to JGC.org and follow the link, the purple link
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.400]   to the pledge bank and pledge.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.520]   I bet we can get 10,000 people.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.960]   Just by the end of the show.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.440]   By the end of the show.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.720]   Just because you really wanted to do this.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.360]   You know, 10 bucks.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:50.920]   What does that cost?
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.480]   10 bucks.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.560]   It's well worth it.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.080]   You can stop your donation and no agenda for a few weeks.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:58.640]   Hey.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.480]   I thought I would get right.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.160]   Don't take the money out of our pockets.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.800]   For the price of a week of no agenda,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.160]   you can help build the analytical engine.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   How about a week of no-no agenda?
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.560]   How much do you ask people on no agenda for?
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.120]   How much?
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.040]   Do you like have a set donation?
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:18.920]   No, no.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.720]   You go to no agenda.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.200]   Show.com or devork.org/nay.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.880]   And there's a huge variety of opportunities.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   But and you can and you get different things
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.440]   if you donate different amounts.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.120]   Yeah, you can become a knight, which I'm sure our British friend would appreciate.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.640]   Yes.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.920]   A good night.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.240]   Not if I, you know, buying a knight to it is probably the wrong thing to do over here.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.560]   See, if I had given you a thousand bucks instead of this baggage thing,
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.040]   I could have been a knight of the no agenda round table.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.840]   Sir Leo.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   Sir Leo.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.640]   Oh, there's a.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.880]   Leo, if you want to get there's a night layaway plan.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   Layaway.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:01.520]   That's the 20, 20 month program with $50 for 20 months.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.960]   You know, about three months into that $50 a month thing.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.080]   I have a feeling people might have second thoughts.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.520]   I don't know.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.720]   I'm just guessing.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:13.960]   And then there's the $33.33 mothership boarding pass.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.440]   So you can be on the mothership when that Adam tells us is coming.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.760]   But there's other other things.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.080]   There's the $5 a month subscription.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.160]   There's the lucky $30 mo sub.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.440]   You're very clever in this.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.240]   It never ends.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.680]   It's very clever.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.080]   Why is it lucky to give $30 a month?
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.840]   We don't know.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.360]   We just know it is.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.440]   It's just all empirical feedback.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.600]   We just know it's lucky.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.040]   It's very lucky.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.040]   Oh, Lord.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:45.320]   All right.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.120]   Let's take a break.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.880]   And because I got to make some money.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.080]   So I can give this $1,000 to a truly good cause, the Baba
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.040]   Janilidical machine.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.160]   I just think it's so cool that he essentially
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.520]   came up with the principles of computer science 173 years
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.880]   ago in the 1840s.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.000]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.520]   Truly.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.760]   He missed a couple of things, but not much.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.920]   What did he miss?
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.520]   Well, the program wasn't stored inside the computer.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.880]   So it was on the cards.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.120]   It wasn't loaded into memory.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.120]   He didn't have RAM.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.200]   Well, he had RAM, but he was only four.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.360]   The RAM was made of brass.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.040]   But it was only for storage of numbers, basically,
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.160]   not for the program.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.720]   Interesting.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.200]   And the other thing he didn't do
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.440]   is he didn't let the program address memory.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.040]   It was fixed memory location.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.840]   So he couldn't do things like arrays.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.400]   But he had enough power in there.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.560]   He would have no doubt figured it out.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.080]   How do you do it?
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.240]   I want you to design that thing so it can run APL.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.280]   Then you have to have a special keyboard.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.360]   Was there a keyboard?
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.600]   Was there any user entry?
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.440]   There was a special whack job keyboard.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.400]   No, not for APL for the bad, but generally.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.400]   APL.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   Well, no, I see.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.480]   You had to punch cards.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.160]   And then you fed everything in on cards.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.560]   So you put in your program, your numbers, everything.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.720]   And it would punch cards out.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   I love it.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.800]   What a great idea.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.160]   Hey, before we go on, I do want to mention Ford.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.680]   We were talking about autonomous cars.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.560]   I had a great time driving that.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.720]   Ford flexed with it.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.200]   It was actually really cool.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.240]   I didn't do it right.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.640]   So you're looking for parking space.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.480]   No, it's a fairly big car because it seats like eight or something.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.120]   So you press the button that says, find me a parking space.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   And you're driving along.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   And it sees.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.320]   It spots a space that's big enough.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.240]   And the little light goes on.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.720]   And then it says, pull forward.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.080]   So you pull forward, pull forward, pull forward, pull forward.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   And this says, OK, stop.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.520]   And it says, now, park.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.840]   And you press the button.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.880]   And the wheel goes, woo, woo, woo.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.040]   And it parallel parks you automatically.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.000]   Now, my mistake was--
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.440]   I should have thought about this--
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.560]   that I took my hands off the wheel,
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.240]   but I also took my feet off the brake.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.360]   They didn't mention to me that, well, actually,
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.200]   once you're parked, you probably should put your foot on the brake
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.920]   because the car is idling.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.600]   It will continue to back up.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.640]   So I'm just like, whoa, this is cool.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.080]   And I'm with my hands and feet in the air.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.360]   And of course, the car parks perfectly,
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.800]   and then continues to back up into the fiesta behind me.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.600]   Now, the good news is I was wearing a helmet.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.560]   So I was uninjured, and neither the flex nor the fiesta
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.720]   took even a ding.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.360]   I mean, they looked fantastic.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.200]   I think we were going-- by the time we hit the fiesta--
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.920]   because it was a bit of a ways-- we were going eight or nine
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.440]   miles an hour.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.920]   We were-- it jerked me.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.360]   Anyway, they're working on this stuff, this bliss stuff that
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.680]   lets you know if there's a car in your blind spot,
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.320]   and there's some really cool stuff in there.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.120]   But the technology that you know I love the best
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.360]   in my Ford Mustang, they call it Ford Sync.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.720]   Now, they call it my Ford Touch.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:49.160]   It's the amazing turn-by-turn directions, voice-activated,
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:54.360]   music search, traffic alerts, audible text messages, 911
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.840]   assist in the Ford Sync, my Ford Touch.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.200]   It's amazing.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.840]   It's amazing.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.440]   It's actually Ford made a very clever decision.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.800]   They said, we're going to build this capability into the car,
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.600]   but it will use the capability of the phone,
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.280]   because these phones are getting upgraded all the time.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.360]   So as the phone capabilities improve,
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.040]   automatically, my Ford Touch gets smarter.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.720]   So for instance, I have the new Android Droid X.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.360]   Well, when a text message comes in--
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.960]   and you could turn this off, but I haven't said so that my
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.560]   Ford Touch says, being-- there's a text message, I could say,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.200]   read it to me.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.520]   It reads me the message that gives me a set of canned
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.600]   responses I could send back, all without taking my eyes off
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.000]   the road or my hands off the wheel.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.320]   I mean, it's just fantastic.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.760]   Of course, if you've got an iPod or an iPhone with Bluetooth,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.080]   or it's got an iPod USB connector, so you can connect any
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.520]   device via USB, it'll play the USB--
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.400]   the songs, of course.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.080]   But it also, you can command a song.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.720]   You can say, play U2, and it'll play U2.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.680]   You can say, play next.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.320]   Play more like that.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.840]   You can say, call John, and it'll call John.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.120]   I mean, it is so fantastic.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.300]   Works with your Bluetooth enabled phone on most
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.120]   phones, not only can you make calls, but you can also listen
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:09.920]   to music.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.040]   You get turn-by-turn directions without buying a more
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.080]   expensive GPS device with a big screen.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.680]   You get personalized traffic alerts.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.480]   It knows your route, and it'll send you traffic alerts as you
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.880]   go, and it'll even reroute you with turn-by-turn directions.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.680]   It is hands-free calling at its best.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.560]   I want you to try it.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.880]   Go to any Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealer, say, I want to
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   see the sync, the My Ford Touch, or you can go to syncmyridepodcast.com
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.480]   to find out more.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.300]   They've got lots of videos and demos and so forth.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:40.500]   And next week, I think I'm going to talk about the Ford Edge,
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.740]   because this is their highest tech vehicle.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:48.220]   This car has every wonderful feature in there.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.900]   I'm just really excited about it.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.220]   Ford is taking the state-of-the-art to the next level.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.020]   My Ford Touch, at your Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury dealer,
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:03.220]   or visit syncmyridepodcast.com.
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:07.960]   John Graham coming is here from JGC.org.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.120]   He is a computer scientist.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.820]   I mean, you work in the computer business.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:13.860]   I am a nerd.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.020]   He's a nerd.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.300]   Also the author of The Geek Atlas, which is a wonderful,
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.980]   beautiful book with 128.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.900]   Is that how many it is?
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.980]   Beautiful geek sites that you should see.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.140]   80 is 128 places, yes.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.180]   All the places you should get to.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.540]   I want to go.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.060]   You should--
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:29.900]   So this is a rough topic.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.780]   I want to show you something.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.180]   All right.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:32.980]   How do we get off topic?
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.380]   We just came out of the ad.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.860]   Look, don't deny John.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.420]   Is that an avocado?
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.940]   This is an avocado.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.300]   Wow, that is a huge avocado.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:40.900]   You have that, John.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.900]   That's an alligator pear.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.460]   It's a hoss.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.340]   No.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.420]   It doesn't have any of those little bumps on it.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.940]   Oh, what is that, then?
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.500]   It's a Mexican avocado.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.300]   OK.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:51.820]   You know what they say?
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.900]   The bigger the avocado.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   I'll tell you something.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.420]   I'll bet you this thing tastes like crap.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.860]   Well, thanks for sharing it with us, John.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.300]   You go make some guacamole.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:03.940]   I can't understand.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.140]   I'm watching the baseball playoffs.
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.580]   And TBS has ads for avocado.
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.380]   Like not like a brand.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.980]   Just avocado.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.260]   Like who pays for that?
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.420]   The avocado country.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.100]   Or the Haas Company, which is not the same as the avocado.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.700]   It's the name of some distributor.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:24.300]   I don't even understand it because I grew avocados.
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.300]   We sold them in the store.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.980]   I mean, aren't there a million different avocado growers?
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.660]   Is there somebody who's so big that it's
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.220]   worth buying the baseball playoffs?
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.540]   The four e-savocados outside of California.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.780]   Oh, maybe that's the issue.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:38.780]   They're trying to get--
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.420]   Are you kidding me?
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.540]   All over the place.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.020]   Really?
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:41.780]   Everybody may ever say--
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.580]   Everybody's in a guacamole.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.060]   --acado in New York.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:44.740]   Guacamole.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:45.740]   That's what's changed, John.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:49.180]   Well, there are other places besides New York in the world.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:49.540]   Really?
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.260]   All of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona--
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.820]   Yeah, yeah, guacamole.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.420]   --and New Mexico.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.540]   In Austin, they love the guac, don't they?
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.020]   You can't find a good avocado in Wyoming.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.020]   Maybe that--
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.380]   I don't know.
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.180]   I've never looked for one.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:02.780]   You may be right.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.500]   That's why they're buying the ads because they
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.060]   want the world to know.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.260]   And I'm looking at the chat room.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:13.900]   And here's a guy Lenin in 2010 says guacamole is nasty.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.380]   See?
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.340]   I mean, come on.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.140]   How can that be?
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.700]   Well, you were the one who said your avocado probably
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.540]   doesn't taste very good.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.500]   No, that avocado has got to be a dog.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.300]   Come on.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:22.700]   Hey, you know.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.540]   Watery, faceless.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.260]   No, that looks good.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.700]   Not all avocados are bumpy.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.900]   I know, but very few of them, besides the Haas variety,
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.260]   they have that intense avocado flavor.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.620]   By the way, Woz is going to join me and Tom this week,
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.500]   Wednesday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.460]   for a one-on-one discussion.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.380]   I guess it'd be a two-on-one discussion.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.420]   That's right.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.220]   It's kind of like that triangulate thing, John,
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.980]   that we were going to do.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.820]   We're going to start bringing in some big names.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.540]   We've got John Parry Barlow next week.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:16.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   We're going to bring in some big names.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.980]   What do you think of these Facebook groups?
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.980]   I've used them a couple of times.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.980]   In fact, I invited John.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.980]   You're in the Twitter host group.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.980]   That's a private group.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:31.980]   I thought you quit Facebook, Leo.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.980]   I had to go back because I couldn't cover the damn story, John.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.980]   Right?
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.980]   I had to go back.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.980]   You know when I went back, John,
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.980]   is when they introduced places.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.980]   I said, "Well, I can't talk about places
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.980]   because I don't have places."
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.980]   I'm keeping my eyes on them.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.980]   So I know what they're up to.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:54.980]   That's all.
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:55.980]   No, I admit.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.980]   It's kind of my tale between my legs.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.980]   I have to say, "Praise for Facebook."
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:01.980]   I'll be the first to praise them
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.980]   for one of the things they did this week,
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.980]   which was they announced that you can now download
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.980]   all of your Facebook content as a big old zip file.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   It's an HTML file with all the pictures.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.980]   Not only all the biggest mistake they've ever made.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   I know.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.980]   They opened the door, didn't they?
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:17.980]   All the pictures.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.980]   Not only that, but all the pictures other people have taken
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.980]   than tagged you in.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.980]   Why is that a mistake, John?
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.980]   Well, obviously you have that other movement going on,
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.980]   the open source Facebook,
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.980]   and any competitor that comes along now,
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.980]   obviously they got this from the bloggers,
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.980]   the idea of the bloggers.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.980]   If you run type of a pad, you can export it to WordPress.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   Squarespace, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   You can do all these kind of cool things,
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.980]   but they essentially had a captive audience
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.980]   and now they're saying, "Yeah, you can go wherever you want.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.980]   Now you can quit our system when something better comes along."
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.980]   What kind of marketing idea is this?
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.980]   I think it's good marketing.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.980]   This is called responsible marketing instead of trying to trap
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.980]   people in your roach motel.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.980]   You already had them trapped, though.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.980]   It's not like you're trying to do anything sneaky.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:03.980]   That's true.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.980]   They're already trapped.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.980]   They could have just ignored the idea.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.980]   So, John, you're saying you've got them.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:09.980]   Why let them out?
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.980]   Sorry.
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.980]   Well, Myspace didn't stop,
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.980]   didn't allow people to take their data with them,
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.980]   and everybody left them anyway.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:21.980]   And I don't think most people are going to go to the trouble
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.980]   to export all of this data necessarily.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.980]   Let me write the data this down.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.980]   Hold on a second, Tom.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.980]   I need to write the date down.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.980]   You've just predicted that nothing's going to come up.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:33.980]   It's 1010.
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:37.980]   But John, in England, you'd probably write it 1010.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.980]   Right.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:39.980]   That's correct.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.980]   Yes, luckily today is one of those few days
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.980]   where we can agree on what the date is.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.980]   And I suppose we should commemorate it because,
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   although this, I think, is stretching it considerably,
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   1010.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.980]   1010 is binary for the number 42,
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.980]   which is everyone knows is the answer to the question of life,
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.980]   the universe, and everything.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:59.980]   I don't think I'm stretching it to that.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.980]   I think we're coming to that answer today.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.980]   You know, like next year, 11, 11, 11, well, that's binary,
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.980]   what, 128.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   Ooh.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.980]   Well, 128.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.980]   128.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   That's the first memory that you got in an original Macintosh.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:20.980]   See, you see, you see, you see, and then 12, 12, 12.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980]   That's nothing.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.980]   It's not 128, Leo.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.980]   It's 127.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.980]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:25.980]   Oh, well.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:26.980]   Sorry.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.980]   Sorry to rain on your parade.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:29.980]   That's 27.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   No, wait a minute.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   No, wait a minute, John.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   Did you enter that into a calculator?
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.980]   You just knew that off the top of your head.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.980]   I knew that off the top of my head.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:37.980]   All right.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:38.980]   He's a geek.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.980]   That was a good idea.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.980]   Seven ones, eight ones is 256.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.980]   So seven ones, but eight ones is not 256.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:47.980]   It's 255.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   Well, somebody says it's actually 63.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:53.980]   Is eight one?
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:54.980]   Oh, yeah, because we're trying to see.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:55.980]   It's 63.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   It's 63.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   It's 63.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   It's 63.
[00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.980]   So it's half of 128.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:07.980]   So we'd like to find out what's going on.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.980]   So we'd like to find anyone who's 63 years old on that day.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.980]   That would be interesting.
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:16.980]   Yeah, if you're 63 years old today on 10, 10, 10.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:17.980]   Happy birthday.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.980]   That's all.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.980]   12, 12, 12 and base two is nothing.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.980]   It doesn't mean anything because there's no two.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:24.980]   It's too.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.980]   Keith's in here.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.980]   Keith, Keith, what birthday is this for you today today?
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.980]   He's 55.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.980]   So if you're 55 on 10, 10, 10, 10, nothing, you don't get any
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.980]   prize or anything.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   But it is his birthday.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.980]   So let's go to a couple of new stories that fascinate me.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.980]   What fascinates you today, John C.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.980]   Google responds to Oracle's Android patent lawsuit suit.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.980]   Did you like the response?
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980]   Or was it?
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.980]   Well, this is Gizmodo.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   Oh, no, I'm in gadget writing.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.980]   We break it down.
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:01:00.980]   And basically they broke it down into this one sentence.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   Google says Android doesn't infringe on any of Oracle's patents.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.980]   And even if it does, those patents are invalid and/or
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.980]   unenforceable for a variety of reasons anyway.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   So you know, shove it.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.980]   We don't violate any of your patents.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.980]   And even if we did, your patents suck.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.980]   So there.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.980]   Let's take your bad.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   Just how?
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:27.980]   Oracle and Son of...
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.980]   So just how patent works.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.980]   That's how patents work, right?
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   I mean, you just say no.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.980]   And even if I did no, and even if I did no.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   Right.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.980]   And then let's sort it out.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.980]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:42.980]   So, okay.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   So do we...
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:44.980]   Moving on.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:45.980]   So that's it on that one, huh?
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.980]   You're done with that one now.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.980]   Do you know anything about thimble.net?
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.980]   No, what is that?
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.980]   It's a decentralized Twitter.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   Well, is anybody heard of this?
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.980]   Is there an E in it or is it thi-in-b-l?
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980]   Yep.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980]   Yep.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.980]   Dotnet.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.980]   Thimble with no-e.net.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.980]   And the idea is it's a manifesto.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.980]   So it's not actually doing anything.
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.980]   For the open web written in code.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.980]   Oh, well, maybe it is doing something.
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.980]   It's not the birchcroft fine-bone China site then.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.980]   You have to drop the E out of thimble.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.980]   Ah, you see, you put a thimble in there.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.980]   The most significant challenge, the open web will...
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.980]   I don't know why everything is underlined on here.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:24.980]   This is a bad sign.
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:54.980]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.980]   It's not a bad sign.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:57.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.980]   It's a bad sign.

[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.980]   It's a bad sign.

[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:08.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:22.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:27.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:32.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:37.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:42.980]   It's a bad sign.

[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:06.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:11.980]   I don't know if it's unaudible,
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   but this is the book I recommend.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   It's not a theory.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   It's the 10th Amendment.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.980]   It is unaudible.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.980]   It's all there.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:45.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:50.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:55.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:14:00.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.980]   It's a bad sign.

[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:16.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:21.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:26.980]   It's a bad sign.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   It's a bad sign.

[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:02.980]   Give it a try.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:07.980]   I think you will like it.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:12.980]   All kinds of books.
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   There's books for teens and young adults.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.980]   There's books for little kids too.

[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:30.980]   As John, I hear the analytic engine running in the basement.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   It's the washing machine.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:39.980]   If you're in the UK, there is Audible UK, but the books are different and so forth.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:42.980]   Some of the offers may be different, but it's worth a try.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   Books are all in English too.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.980]   That's one of the things I like about the Audible UK folks.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.980]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.980]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.980]   Mark Zuckerberg said, "I'm not going to go see the social network."
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   He said, "I'll never see that at all."
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   Yeah, big talk.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   Well, it was a big talk.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:04.980]   Apparently, he shut down the Facebook offices, bought out of theater, so they wouldn't see him cry.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   And took the entire Facebook staff of four or five hundred people to see the movie.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.980]   I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.980]   Apparently...
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:16.980]   Did he boo?
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.980]   Well, here's...
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:23.980]   We don't know because there's no spy in there, but this is an article published by Lucy McDonald's
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.980]   and she says, "No biz correspondent for Sky News."
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:32.980]   She says, "Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Mark in the film, has a cousin who's a senior Stafford
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.980]   Facebook of all things."
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:35.980]   And is close to Mark.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:41.980]   Afterwards, he emailed Jesse to say, "Mark, really liked the parts of the movie he agreed with."
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   This is a quote...
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   This is actually Aaron Sorkin talking.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.980]   So we don't know.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:49.980]   We don't know what he agreed with.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:55.980]   And I think everybody knows that there are things in the movie that never happened.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:00.980]   Do you know that movie was sped up to meet time requirements?
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   Really?
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   How do you know that?
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:03.980]   The whole movie.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:04.980]   They used two technologies.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.980]   They used both the fact that you know where you changed the frame rate and you keep the voices
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.980]   exactly the same so it sounds natural.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.980]   And then they also...
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   They pull frames out to give it kind of a more hectic quality.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:17.980]   You know, it's funny.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:18.980]   You're saying that...
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.980]   It's actually a three hour movie.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   It's funny you should say that because it felt that way to me.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.980]   And I thought I was just Aaron Sorkin's bum bum bum writing.
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:26.980]   It felt...
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   They should know.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   It felt hectic to me.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:29.980]   It felt sped up to me.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.980]   It felt...
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:31.980]   It was anxious.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:32.980]   It was anxious.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:33.980]   It was untackling fast.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.980]   You know, we had Dana Brunetti, the producer of the film from Trigger Street on Net at Night last week.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.980]   I should have asked him about that.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:40.980]   That's fascinating.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   I have no idea.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   I'll send him an email and ask him to confirm or deny it.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.980]   It was...
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:46.980]   It seems like they...
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.980]   It should have been a longer movie.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.980]   It seemed a little frantic.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:54.980]   Apparently the producer, whoever was at the top of the studio, said, "Hey, this movie, we can't have it that long."
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.980]   So they said, "I have an idea.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:57.980]   Let's just speed it up."
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.980]   Have you all seen it?
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:00.980]   You liked it?
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.980]   I saw it.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:03.980]   What do you think, Tom?
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.980]   I thought it was a great movie.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:11.980]   If you don't care anything about the Facebook story or social networking, you're not in social media, you're not inside the bubble.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.980]   Great movie, well written, well shot.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:14.980]   All that.
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.980]   Very nice story.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:23.980]   If you were going to it wanting to see the story of Facebook, well like many Hollywood movies, you're not really going to see that.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.980]   There's a lot of gaping holes in it.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.980]   And Sorkin modified things to make a good story.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   And he made a good story.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:32.980]   But it's not a biography.
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   It's not as true to the Facebook situation as...
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   You know, I put it on Twitter.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.980]   It's like as the lion in winter is to Henry II.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.980]   The social network is to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.980]   This is why I follow Tom on Twitter.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.980]   It's a obscrew solutions like that.
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:53.980]   Let's bring his Twitter feed the life.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:57.980]   Somebody in the chat rooms asked the rhetorical question.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.980]   Chat Roulette in 3D.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:03.980]   I don't know what to say about that.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:04.980]   No.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:05.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   I just thought it was funny.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   Facebook did it.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.980]   We started talking about it.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.980]   I mentioned that the download thing.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.980]   But they also added Facebook groups.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.980]   We've been using groups as I said.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   But there is a flaw in groups which a number of people have pointed out is that anybody can add you to a group.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.980]   Well, not anybody.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.980]   Any of your friends can add you to a group.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.980]   Somebody added Jason Callicannes to a group called Nambla.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.980]   Not the same Nambla.
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   That's why I'm here for the purpose of embarrassing people.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:42.980]   Now, this is a problem because Jason added, I think he was like me with Facebook originally.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.980]   He added anybody who has to be a friend.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.980]   So he has the 5,000 friends, the limit.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:47.980]   Obviously, they're not really friends.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:54.980]   Facebook's point of view is, look, if you make somebody your friend, that means you trust them enough to not add you to groups you shouldn't be added to.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.980]   And they're in Lice the Rub.
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.980]   Not only that, once you get added to a group, you get a ton of email from that group.
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:03.980]   Are you on Facebook, John?
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.980]   Because I tried to find you so I could add you to a group.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:07.980]   Sorry, no.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:08.980]   Damn.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.980]   For that reason alone.
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.980]   I had some good groups.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.980]   I was going to subscribe you to.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.980]   Tom, I'm sure you've had this happen now.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:18.980]   People have added you to groups.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   Have you noticed the sudden flood of email?
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:21.980]   It's the only notice you get.
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.980]   The only groups I've been added to were by you.
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:25.980]   So you didn't get it?
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.980]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:32.980]   No, because about a year or so ago, I changed how I use Facebook.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:36.980]   Because I saw them starting to integrate this data into more and more places.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:41.980]   I said, I can't use this as an open, like, I'll let anyone follow me.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.980]   I'll follow anyone sort of situation.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:48.980]   It's becoming too personal, not by my own choice, but by the way, Facebook is saying,
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.980]   we're going to use your contact list.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:52.980]   We're going to make it integrated into this and that.
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.980]   And I'm like, well, wait a minute.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.980]   I don't want that.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:23:01.980]   So I went through and I purged my friend list of anyone that I didn't actually know.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:04.980]   And most people understood it.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.980]   A few people got their nose bent out of shape.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.980]   But after I explained, like, hey, it's nothing against you.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:11.980]   I'm just the way Facebook is using this data now.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.980]   I need to make sure I protect it.
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:21.980]   And I'm glad I did that because now with this groups thing, I haven't been added to any groups because I don't.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:28.980]   I'm not like Calcanis where he's got everybody that he can possibly up to the 5,000 person max follow.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:33.980]   And so far, my friends have not been that funny.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.980]   Yeah, I...
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   Well, that killed the show.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   Well, no, I'm just thinking about this whole idea.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980]   You know, this is...
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.980]   I think the reason Facebook does this is because there's a lot more...
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   Well, first of all, remember that Google presentation they did in Europe where I said,
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.980]   here's the problem with friends is that there isn't just one monolithic group of friends.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:53.980]   There's different kinds of friends.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:54.980]   There's coworkers.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.980]   There's people you went to school with.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:59.980]   There's people you hang out at the bars with.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:00.980]   There's different kinds of friends.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:05.980]   And perhaps these groups shouldn't really overlap.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   If you're a school teacher, for instance, and you have some of your students or friends because you want to mentor them,
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:16.980]   you may not want to have pictures of you at the bar sent to them.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:23.980]   So I think Facebook, realizing that they needed to address this issue because the way it is on Facebook up to now has been,
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:25.980]   you're either a friend or not, right?
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.980]   There's no...
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   So they made friends list, but then Mark Zuckerberg rightly realized nobody ever wants to make lists.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:32.980]   That's a pain in the ass.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.980]   So they created these groups.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:37.980]   And I think the groups actually do exactly what they wanted because you don't have to do all the work.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.980]   Your friends can help add people to the groups.
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.980]   The groups kind of formed themselves naturally.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:49.980]   And now you can have a group of school chums that sees pictures that are different from the group of bar mates.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:50.980]   And I think that's a good way to do it.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:56.980]   I just think that they have to tweak it a little bit because it is sending a lot of email and maybe a little bit of a surprise.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   Well, and not everybody's been using Facebook the way Mark's the real problem.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.980]   Well, that's the real problem.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.980]   That's the real problem, isn't it?
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.980]   I mean, I dealt with this a while ago.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:11.980]   I did a very similar thing, which is I deleted everybody who wasn't an actual friend or family from Facebook.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.980]   And that was most of my friends were colleagues.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:20.980]   And I decided I'd put people who were colleagues on LinkedIn to make it see for me there.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   And anybody wanted to deal with me in public on Twitter.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.980]   So I just used three different services.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   And on Facebook, it's totally friends and family.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.980]   Because I think this dividing into groups is just way too complicated.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   I'm bound to accidentally send a picture of me completely drunk to all my coworkers.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:41.980]   Well, we don't have to ask what Facebook's motivation is.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   It's just more information about your social graph, who you know, who you don't know, and how you're related to them.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.980]   And the more they get of that, the more valuable that information is.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:49.980]   Okay.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.980]   Can you opt out of groups?
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.980]   I don't believe you can.
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   Or yes, you can't.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.980]   I think I take that back.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.980]   I think there is a button that says I will not be part of groups.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.980]   Let me see.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:01.980]   No, I think it's all of them at once, not.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:02.980]   Right.
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:04.980]   It's an all or nothing proposition.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.980]   Well, you can quit a group.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   You can quit a group, but you can, I think you can block and say, don't ever add me to a group.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:15.980]   But you can't say, make me, allow me to approve every group before I'm added to it.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.980]   If you're added to a group by a friend, you're out.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:18.980]   I wish you could do that.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:20.980]   They really need a setting for that.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.980]   We've been through that with email.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:23.980]   Right.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.980]   With email lists, getting added to them or actually opting into them.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:30.980]   I think Facebook probably ought to make this an opt-in thing where you say, do you want to be part of this group?
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.980]   And you confirm it.
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.980]   You know, already there's kind of an interesting use of this.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   There is a, Robert Scobel started a couple of groups, one called Tech Leaders and Influencers,
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   and one called Tech News Bloggers.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:49.980]   And Facebook responded to these criticisms within the Tech News Bloggers.
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:53.980]   I mean, what a great way for Facebook to go right to the people who are talking about this issue.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   Were they members or were they just spying on the group?
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.980]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:58.980]   I presume they were.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.980]   That's a very good question.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.980]   I'm going to presume that they didn't violate any rules when they actually were asked to join the group.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:09.980]   Maybe they asked Robert, hey, can you add me to the group so I can respond to it?
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.980]   But it was actually, they said, well, you know, here's our thinking.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.980]   Here's, this is something we've never heard from Facebook before.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.980]   Here's why we implemented it this way.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:25.980]   And they said, we think it's kind of like an email list where, or email, you don't ask to be added to email.
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.980]   You just, you know, you get an email, somebody, you know, an email thread, and somebody adds you to the thread.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:33.980]   You see seed, and then you're part of that thread.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   I'm not sure I agree with their logic, but what I found interesting was that they had thought about this quite a bit
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.980]   and tried to figure out what's the best way to implement it.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:45.980]   And you can imagine how difficult it is to implement something like this.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:50.980]   I've got to, I don't want to just jump into a new topic.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:51.980]   Go ahead.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:52.980]   We're done with this one.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.980]   New topic.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.980]   Adobe Microsoft.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.980]   Anybody have any thoughts on this?
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   I think it's bogus.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:04.980]   Tom, you covered this when it was breaking news that Adobe, that Microsoft might be acquiring Adobe.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:05.980]   They have been meeting with Adobe.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:12.980]   Well, that's the actual story is that Steve Balmer and the CEO of Adobe had a closed-door meeting.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   It's reported that they talked about ways of partnering, and then somebody somewhere speculated that maybe they talked about buying,
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.980]   because, well, there's one way of partnering is Microsoft buys Adobe.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.980]   And then it just all went off from Microsoft.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.980]   My understanding of the story was Balmer made some allusion to it.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:32.980]   I never saw a quote.
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.980]   And maybe I missed it, but I never saw it.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.980]   Well, first of all, this would be a huge purchase.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:37.980]   I mean, how much is Adobe worth?
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.980]   I mean, we're talking a big, big purchase.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:40.980]   Not that Microsoft could do it.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:41.980]   Not as much as Yahoo.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:42.980]   20 billion.
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:43.980]   20 billion.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:50.980]   So it's not an easy acquisition, especially from a company that hasn't acquired publicly any company this year.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:57.980]   They've done some small acquisitions that they haven't made a big deal about, but there hasn't been anything newsworthy that they've acquired all year long.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:58.980]   So they're saving up for Adobe.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:28:59.980]   I don't know.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:05.980]   Well, the reason for that, Thomas, because they're still wiping their brows saying, "Wow, we just dodged a bullet with that Yahoo."
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.980]   We almost bought Yahoo.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.980]   They woke up with their hangover, and we're like, "What did I buy?"
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.980]   Yahoo.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.980]   Shh.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:13.980]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:19.980]   I think it would be a good thing, actually, if Microsoft bought Adobe, because it would concentrate all the really bad security vulnerabilities in one company.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.980]   That's what we need to do.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.980]   It would sure help users.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   It would be bad for Apple, though.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:31.980]   It would be really quite a challenge to Apple, because Adobe publishes some of the most, well, between Adobe and Microsoft,
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.980]   probably three quarters of the Apple software marketplace between Office and Photoshop.
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:41.980]   But it brings us to the real point here, which is Microsoft trying to shove phone seven down everyone's throat.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.980]   Anybody think of, have any thoughts on where that's headed?
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:49.980]   We're going to cover, we've decided to cover, even though I have to get up very early in the morning to do it, because it's 6.30.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.980]   In New York?
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:54.980]   Yeah, it's 6.30 Pacific time, 9.30 Eastern tomorrow morning.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.980]   Microsoft will stream this live.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.980]   Tom, you want to come in early?
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   You don't have to.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:01.980]   I'll be sitting here.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   I'll be sitting here, my jammies.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   Microsoft, wait, let me get this straight, Leo.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   Microsoft's going to be streaming it live to the west coast at 6.30 in the morning.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.980]   This is their idea of good marketing.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   They hadn't really thought about it. They said, well, it's 9.30 in New York.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:17.980]   They hadn't really thought about it, obviously.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.980]   It's a Seattle company.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.980]   There's people that even work at Microsoft won't be seeing it.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:29.980]   Well, I mean, yeah, it does seem odd, but we'll be here.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   I'll turn on the cameras.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:31.980]   We'll stream.
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   I may not look to clean shaven, but we'll stream it live, and I'll do what we do traditionally with this kind of breaking news, which is commentary.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   All the rot will be there, and so we will get him on after the event, and ask his opinion.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   He's written the book on Windows Phone 7.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.980]   You know, John, everybody, I know who's seen Windows Phone 7 kind of likes it.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.980]   You know, I believe it's probably a good product, but that doesn't mean anything.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:54.980]   It's too late.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.980]   It's a little too little, too late.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:01.980]   It's still probably not going to have the display the Apple has.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:07.980]   And, you know, they're so far behind on the curve, even though they invented the entire market, which is the irony here.
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:18.980]   They're so far behind on the curve with the new, you know, the new paradigm for these things that I don't see how they can catch up, and I think it's already too late.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.980]   You know, I think they're locked out.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.980]   You know, it really doesn't like Microsoft right now.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   The folks who do Angry Birds, Rovio, Rovio Mobile, which is a Finnish company, observed in Microsoft ad, went online ad copy, where they were showing, I think they were showing, I think they were going to be a little bit more.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   Icons for apps, the Angry Birds icon.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:44.980]   Rovio said, "Hey, they didn't ask our permission.
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:46.980]   We aren't currently developing for Windows Phone 7.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.980]   We don't know if we will develop for Windows Phone 7.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:54.980]   We think it's foul play to show the Angry Birds icon in an ad for Windows Phone 7."
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:55.980]   I kind of agree.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:00.980]   This is the hottest app on iPhone, on iPad, and now on Android.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:05.980]   And this is obviously Microsoft saying, "Hey, we got that too, but they don't!"
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:15.980]   They tweeted, "They are not presently committed to bringing the game to Windows Phone, and the icon is being used in Microsoft marketing completely without permission."
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:16.980]   Whoops!
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.980]   Well, there you have it.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:19.980]   Whoops!
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.980]   In a nutshell.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:24.980]   That's a good way to piss off the number one developer for games.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:34.980]   Microsoft sent a note to Engadget saying, "It appears information was mistakenly posted to Microsoft's website and has been removed."
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.980]   And of course, the offending logo is now gone.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:41.980]   But thanks to Engadget, we have a screen capture that will live forever.
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.980]   Microsoft do that out of arrogance, you think?
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:45.980]   Ah, they won't care.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:47.980]   They'll love the free publicity.
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:48.980]   That's great.
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.980]   They're not common to Microsoft, yes.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   They probably assume, "Hey, we're going to be a huge platform."
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:54.980]   Of course, they're going to develop for us.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:58.980]   Well, there is a story that goes along with that, if you want to hear it.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:32:59.980]   Yes, I do.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:11.980]   So when we licensed PC Magazine to Brazil for the first time, I went down there and hung out with the guy who was the publisher, who apparently was a world-class surfboarder.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.980]   Whatever you do when you have this surfboard, you're not-no-anyway.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.980]   Surfer, we call it.
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:17.980]   You win Surfer?
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.980]   You win Surfer world class.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:24.980]   So anyway, he brings up the story about Microsoft because he's getting advertisements for the first few issues.
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:28.980]   And the Microsoft guy comes in and he says, "Here's what he has I want to put in.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.980]   I want this ad, this ad, and this ad I want on page four.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   I want to do that."
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.980]   And so the guy says, "Okay, well, this is going to-no, no, no.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   We're not going to pay for these ads."
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.980]   He says, "What do you mean you're not going to pay for these ads?"
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:45.980]   He says, "No, you have to put these ads in because no one's going to think you're a credible magazine unless you have Microsoft ads in your magazine."
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:47.980]   Fair, fair, fair try.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.980]   Did he do it?
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:51.980]   No, he told them to screw themselves and slam the door on him.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:55.980]   And did people believe that he was a credible magazine without Microsoft?
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.980]   He stuck around for a number of years and then now he's done.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:01.980]   I would be incensed by such arrogance.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:02.980]   He was incensed.
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.980]   That's why he told me this story, knowing I'd repeat it.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:05.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:07.980]   I mean, that is fairly arrogant.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.980]   Although it's a reasonable try.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.980]   Yeah, I guess he could give it a shot.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.980]   He could give it a shot.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.980]   It didn't pan out, but you know, you can't fault him for-
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.980]   You can't fault the guys for trying.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.980]   Try and give us a free ad.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:23.980]   Look, you don't have-
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.980]   Don't ask.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:25.980]   Yeah, like they needed.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:26.980]   You don't ask.
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:27.980]   You don't get, right?
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   It's just that simple.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:32.980]   This was a crazy day on Wednesday.
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:35.980]   So Google TV announcement from Logitech.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:39.980]   Facebook announces groups and this download thing.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.980]   And then Cisco, same day, same time.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:47.980]   And all of this, by the way, happening in San Francisco, has a press conference announcing
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:48.980]   Yumi.
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:52.980]   Perhaps the worst name I've ever heard.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:54.980]   And it's not even you and me, right?
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.980]   It's you and I.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   You and I.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.980]   So everybody's saying, "Umi, Umi?"
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:34:59.980]   Umi?
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:00.980]   Oprah?
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:01.980]   Oprah?
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:02.980]   Well, if you look at the advertising-
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.980]   Isn't this some sort of fish row that's kind of gooey?
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:06.980]   Yeah, that's what-
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.980]   Who said that that sounded like it's a bad sushi?
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.980]   I think Molly would.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:11.980]   It's got a-
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:15.980]   It's got one of those bars over the use, so you know you're pronouncing that long, so that's
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:16.980]   you.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.980]   Well, yeah, all Americans know that.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:19.980]   But they-
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   Well, they do because of Molly Crew.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:21.980]   Right.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.980]   Crew.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.980]   No, it's not an oom-loud, it's a-
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:25.980]   Well, it's not an oom-loud, it's a long, long-
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:26.980]   Oh, it's a-
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:27.980]   And you know, they-
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:29.980]   They neglected to tell us how to pronounce the "I."
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:32.980]   So really, they've left it up to us, whether it's-
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.980]   Yumi, Umi, could be either.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.980]   I'd say Umi, looking at that.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:39.980]   I would say Umi.
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   Well, you'd be wrong.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:43.980]   See, that long bar over the "U" means it's a long U.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:44.980]   It's Yumi.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:45.980]   When I went grammar school, I was taught that means-
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.980]   Why do you do that while you?
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.980]   You were taught that means "U?"
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:51.980]   And then a smiley face above it means "U."
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:54.980]   That's a short U is the smiley face, and they-
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:56.980]   Bar is a long U, which is U.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:57.980]   Is U?
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.980]   Long U is U?
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:01.980]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.980]   I think Tom's right.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.980]   Well, then they're really screwed up.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   I would pronounce it Umi.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:09.980]   Okay, let me ask the chat room.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:13.980]   Are there any English teachers, six or fifth grade English teachers in the chat room?
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.980]   We have a native English speaker, we should ask him.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.980]   Are there any native English speakers in the chat room?
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.980]   In the chat room.
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:24.980]   What I'd say is $599 for a video conversation thing seems like a lot of money.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:26.980]   I guess we really won't have to learn the name at all.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:28.980]   We changed the name to "U-Gip."
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   Not only is it $599 to buy it, but you pay $30 a month to use it.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.980]   Oh, that's no good.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:36.980]   $26 a month to use it.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.980]   Can't you use Skype for free?
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:39.980]   Yes.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:40.980]   We're trying to get you right now.
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.980]   We don't need this device.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:47.980]   I think it sounds like they woke up in sort of 1985 and thought,
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:50.980]   "Wow, video conferencing is going to be the thing of the future."
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.980]   I didn't realize it would have been done.
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:58.980]   There's this mistaken belief, and this is in the Skype TV as well, that you want to use
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:04.980]   your television for calling people because your television has video on it.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.980]   Isn't that great?
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:06.980]   I'm going to call grandma.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:07.980]   No, you're not.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.980]   Tom, do you remember when there was a series?
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:11.980]   I said, Leo, you probably remember this.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:15.980]   There was a bunch of televisions that were brought out in the 70s that you'd run your
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:19.980]   TV through, and when the phone would ring, it would interrupt the TV show.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:23.980]   You didn't have video, but you would talk over the TV.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:24.980]   It was ridiculous.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:26.980]   That's like caller ID on your direct TV.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.980]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:30.980]   Now the murderer is ringing.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.980]   Ring, ring.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:32.980]   Hi, honey.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:33.980]   Are you doing anything?
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.980]   That was before DVRs, but you couldn't even rewind.
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:38.980]   Now, you can't call a Yumi from your PC.
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:40.980]   We've actually bought a Yumi in order to do it.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.980]   Well, just because we thought, well, maybe if it's like, maybe it's so good.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:44.980]   Oh, great.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.980]   This is what everybody wants to watch.
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:52.980]   You doing a limbo party with flying boxes and then they never miss a thing.
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.980]   Well, I didn't miss that.
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:58.980]   Cisco has got their heads up their ass when it comes to marketing.
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:02.980]   Their latest thing, the obviousy somebody has a, what's the name of that girl who was in
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.980]   Juneau, the actress?
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:06.980]   Oh, those are the worst ads I've ever seen.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:07.980]   Ellen Page.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:12.980]   All this says to me is there's somebody in the marketing department who's got a crush on
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:13.980]   the page.
[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:15.980]   And so they hired her to do these ads.
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:16.980]   It's idiotic.
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:18.980]   They're terrible ads.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:21.980]   Let's just watch one.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.980]   Just, just, knock down everything.
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:27.980]   Let's just watch one just so you get an idea of how awful these ads are.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.980]   This is Ellen Page.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:30.980]   Ellen Page.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.980]   Hey, Mayor Wade.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]   How you doing?
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:33.980]   Great.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:34.980]   Come on here.
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:35.980]   Would you like to see our new police department?
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   Yeah, all right.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.980]   It this way.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   Here it is.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:39.980]   Completely networked.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.980]   So anything happening, Sue's?
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.980]   She's all good.
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:44.980]   That's great.
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:45.980]   She's a big car.
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:49.980]   My local police are watching me.
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:50.980]   Spying.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:52.980]   Spying on me with a Cisco system.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.980]   And they're showing Ellen Page how it works.
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:56.980]   Come on, have Ellen.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:58.980]   You're right, exactly.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:00.980]   Look at, here's Leo's bedroom.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.980]   And the new community.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:02.980]   See it?
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:03.980]   Live it.
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:04.980]   That's not the new community.
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:05.980]   What the hell?
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:06.980]   What the hell?
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:08.980]   I don't want that.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:11.980]   Who's, by the way, who is that ad for?
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.980]   Is it for police departments?
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:14.980]   I'm glad I'm out for me.
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:16.980]   I'd hate to be an alpha.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:21.980]   So in Britain, we've got CCTV cameras everywhere.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:24.980]   And in fact, there's a plan that's been talked about
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:28.980]   where the actual citizens can watch the CCTV cameras
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.980]   and report crimes and get cash.
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:31.980]   Cash rewards.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.980]   Oh, that's great.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:37.980]   You know, if you want the bleeding edge of the big brother state,
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.980]   come to Britain.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:39.980]   Cash rewards.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:41.980]   Let me just check, by the way, and see.
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:42.980]   Cash rewards.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.980]   277 people have now pledged to Babbage.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.980]   We only need 49,723 more.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.980]   Please, please give generously.
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.980]   Give generously.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:54.980]   Give to Lito.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.980]   It's like the countdown to Bernie Madoff being left off.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:59.980]   I don't know what happened.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:01.980]   I've lost control of the switcher.
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.980]   I can't get rid of this picture.
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:07.980]   Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:09.980]   I don't know what's happened.
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:10.980]   I've pushed a button.
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.980]   You just have to watch this.
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:12.980]   You pushed the wrong button.
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:13.980]   I pushed the switch.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:14.980]   I...
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:15.980]   The tote board.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:16.980]   I can't.
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:17.980]   We're stuck on that page.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:18.980]   Tempotty.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.980]   I can't do anything.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.980]   It's a special page that sticks you.
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:23.980]   I don't know what I did.
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:25.980]   You need to put more coal.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:26.980]   Oh, there he is.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:27.980]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:30.980]   Oh, that was painful.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.980]   I don't know.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.980]   I clicked a button.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.980]   Well, now I know.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.980]   Now I know what that button does.
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:38.980]   Oh, you just pushed a random button just to see what it does?
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:39.980]   No, I accidentally clicked it.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.980]   Whatever you do, do not push that button.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   Okay, what do you got there, Lito, that you hung there?
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:46.980]   You didn't hang it there for not to get some attention.
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:47.980]   No, no.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   It's just a...
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:55.980]   Well, when we had a visitor from Kuala Lumpur, K.L., as he calls it, he's wanted you to go to Kuala Lumpur for some time.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.980]   And you refused.
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:02.980]   So he gave me this little handicraft wood placard that says...
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.980]   I refused what?
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.980]   Twit.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.980]   Well, he told me that he couldn't get you to K.L.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.980]   I've been to K.L.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:09.980]   Oh, there you go.
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:10.980]   I'd go back in a minute.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:11.980]   It's a fantastic place.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:13.980]   Daniel, he'd go back in a minute.
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:14.980]   I would.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.980]   He's the host of This Week in Asia, which is not an affiliate.
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:19.980]   Is that one of your shows?
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.980]   No, I don't know anything about it.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:25.980]   But see, I don't mind if Daniel does that show.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:26.980]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.980]   Let's see here.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:37.980]   North Korea, as long as we're in Asia, opens up the internet for a national anniversary.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:40.980]   Isn't that nice of them?
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:44.980]   North Korea appears to have made its first full connection to the internet.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:48.980]   The connection planning for which has been going on...
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:49.980]   Is this a steam connection?
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:50.980]   At least nine months.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.980]   It took them nine months.
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:57.980]   Came as the reclusive country prepares to mark the 65th anniversary of the founding of the
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:03.980]   ruling Workers' Party of Korea with a massive celebration and military parade.
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:06.980]   An analytical engine is powering the internet.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:13.980]   They have a total of, get this, 1024 internet addresses.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:16.980]   They've been reserved for North Korea, but never used.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:17.980]   What is that?
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.980]   A Class G?
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.980]   I think it's NK.
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:27.980]   I've got more addresses on my Cisco router.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:34.980]   Other North Korea-linked websites operate from locations outside the country via direct connections
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.980]   to the China internet.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:40.980]   But now the North Korean IT guys really know their stuff.
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:47.980]   Since Melissa Chan, of course, bought for Al Jazeera.
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:52.980]   I have access to Facebook, Twitter, and here I am able to Skype with you.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.980]   This press release reads like, this is from Computer World, but it reads like it was written
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:02.980]   by Kim Il-un, or whatever his name is, the new guy.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:03.980]   Kim Il-un.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:05.980]   Kim Jong-un is...
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:07.980]   Kim Jong-un.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:10.980]   Kim Jong-il is the current.
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:11.980]   His son is...
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.980]   His third son is been named...
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:15.980]   Unbelievable.
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:16.980]   Kim Jong-un.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:17.980]   Unbelievable.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:18.980]   Close to that.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.980]   It didn't happen in the US where the third son got named to be president.
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:24.980]   I could have sworn there were two questions.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:25.980]   We did the same thing, didn't we?
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.980]   Yeah, they're just imitating us.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:28.980]   Yeah, it's only the new ideas.
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:29.980]   Which doesn't get in.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.980]   Actually, this is an interesting thing about Korea, and then we'll get back to tech, is
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:39.980]   that Kim Jong-il's father is actually still the leader of the government, even though he's
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:40.980]   dead.
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:44.980]   It just sounds like a good way to go.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:48.980]   I think dead politicians running things is the way to go.
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:49.980]   Oh, you know, I'm wrong.
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.980]   Can't make any mistakes.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.980]   Can't nullify them.
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:44:05.180]   According to Reuters, Hulu is planning an IPO that may raise as much as $300 million.
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.980]   Would you buy stock in Hulu today?
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:10.980]   Yes.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:12.980]   John?
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.980]   Probably not.
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:18.980]   John too.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:21.980]   I don't know what John is trying to do.
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.980]   Well, so I can't contact it from here because they just say to you, you're not in the US,
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:27.980]   so you can't watch anything.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:28.980]   Go away.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:30.980]   So I'll buy stock too.
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.980]   So they've got $10 so far, Tom.
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:34.980]   Well, we can't.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.980]   I can't because I'm a technology.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.980]   Yeah, we don't.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:39.980]   But if I could, I probably would.
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:44.980]   I wouldn't actually.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:47.980]   I don't know if I'd buy stock in them.
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:50.980]   I don't know if I'd short it then.
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:51.980]   Short it.
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:53.980]   Well, I don't know if I short it either.
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.980]   It's one of those things where who knows what's going to happen.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.980]   Don't you think we're?
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:58.980]   I think, you know what?
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:02.980]   I am putting my faith in Hulu's leadership, not in their backers.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:03.980]   Yes.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:04.980]   That's the problem.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.980]   Because the guys who run Hulu actually know what they need to do.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:07.980]   And they're just chipping away at the folks who are actually backing them, trying to get them to cooperate and do it.
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:08.980]   Exactly.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.980]   That's why I think it's a bad idea to put any money in them.
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:12.980]   Yeah, maybe you're right.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:14.980]   If they were all united.
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:19.980]   There never will be too many old farts in the industry.
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:21.980]   Suits.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:22.980]   Suits.
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:23.980]   You know what I'm talking about, Leo?
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:24.980]   I do.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:25.980]   I'm talking about your Hawaiian shirts.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:26.980]   That's it.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:27.980]   Look at my suit now.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:29.980]   No Hawaiian here.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:31.980]   They beat me down.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:35.980]   So once again, tomorrow morning, 6.30 in the morning, I can't believe I've committed to this.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:40.980]   I'm going to be turning on the cameras.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:45.980]   We'll do live coverage at 6.30 in Pacific 9.30 eastern time of the Windows Phone 7 launch out of New York City with Microsoft.
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:48.980]   Paul Therat will co-anchor in New York City.
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:54.980]   Wednesday, Tom and I will be interviewing the WaaS, the founder of Apple Computer, co-founder of Apple Computer.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.980]   That'll be 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. eastern.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:59.980]   And of course, don't forget to watch Tom's show Monday through Friday.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:00.980]   Tech News today.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:05.980]   It's 6.50 eastern and then they get underway really by 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m. eastern time.
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:13.980]   And of course, you can subscribe and should subscribe to either the audio or the video or both if you should choose at twit.tv/tnt.
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:15.980]   Tom, it's great to have you on the show.
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.980]   Thank you for taking some time off your day off.
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:19.980]   Yeah, no, it's great.
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:25.980]   Twit is the perfect compliment to Tech News today because what we do every day is say, these are the stories that broke.
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:27.980]   Here's why they're important today.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:31.980]   Here's some stuff you need to know. Here's what you guys are saying about it and we're out.
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.980]   Whereas Twit, you get to analyze it a little more.
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:36.980]   We kind of put it in context. Talk about what it means.
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:39.980]   We chew it and we chew it till it's softened in our cud.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:42.980]   Yeah, it's like the saliva for Tech News.
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:43.980]   Exactly.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.980]   Think of us as the second stomach.
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:49.980]   You're the first stomach.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.980]   Tech News today is the teeth to Twit's saliva.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.980]   And then the stomach.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:01.980]   And by the way, you're going to stick around because coming up eats me Swiss in just a few minutes with Roger Chang.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:02.980]   Alright.
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:05.980]   John C. Devorak is the host of No Agenda.
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:11.980]   And by the way, Leo, I'm telling you right now, Twit is the perfect compliment to No Agenda.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:12.980]   And why is that, John?
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.980]   It's the saliva for political chat.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:21.980]   We are the sputum that spews forth from the mouth of No Agenda.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.980]   Or something.
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.980]   Sputum.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:28.980]   Channel Devorak.com. Check it out.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.980]   There it is.
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:34.980]   And don't forget to contribute to No Agenda because God knows they need your money.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.980]   How much to be an executive producer? $200, huh?
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:40.980]   Yeah, and you get an actual credit.
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:43.980]   Wouldn't it be funny if I were the executive producer of No Agenda?
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:44.980]   You could do it.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:45.980]   Actually, if you worked a lot.
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.980]   Actually, you got to hit 333.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:51.980]   That's associate executive producers, 333 and up you get the executive producers.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:54.980]   How many executive producers are there?
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:48:01.980]   Any given show like this last show we had probably four executive producers and three associates.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:02.980]   Wow.
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:03.980]   That ain't bad.
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:04.980]   What the hell?
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:05.980]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.980]   Let me do some quick math.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:09.980]   You're making thousands of dollars in episode.
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:11.980]   You had four a paid executive producer.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:12.980]   You had four a paid executive producer.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:13.980]   You had four a paid executive producer.
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:14.980]   You had four a paid executive producer.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:16.980]   You had to get the kind of money you're making Leo.
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:17.980]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:22.980]   You're saying that four people paid 333 dollars to be just for that?
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:24.980]   Actually, more than that.
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:27.980]   That's the minimum.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:30.980]   They're allowed to pay more?
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:34.980]   We have supporters and they pay us to be on the air.
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:40.980]   Like, you know, people that use advertisers.
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.980]   I clearly missed the button here somewhere.
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:44.980]   No, no, you believe me?
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:45.980]   You did not miss the boat.
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:46.980]   Wow.
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.980]   Well, anyway, John is a channeledevorac.com.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:53.980]   Give him 333 dollars and 33 cents.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:54.980]   Wow.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:56.980]   Your flabbergasted.
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:58.980]   I am stunned.
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:02.980]   What you're implying is that why would anybody see what I'm saying?
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:03.980]   Exactly what I'm saying.
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:07.980]   We asked for two dollars, 333 dollars.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.980]   And that only gets you one show, right?
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:11.980]   You're not like the associate producer forever.
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:13.980]   No, no, you get this show.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:16.980]   Now, the executive producer of that show.
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:18.980]   That's the way the executive producer business is.
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:22.980]   So I would have to give you 333 dollars and 33 cents every episode to be the executive
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.980]   producer of that episode forever.
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:25.980]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.980]   You can afford it.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:31.980]   It's well within your pocketbook.
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.980]   And Jason Callikenis thought this weekend was a good idea.
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:36.980]   Well, you have it.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.980]   John Graham coming is the author of the geek Atlas.
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:39.980]   And please help him.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:44.980]   Go to pledgebank.com and help him raise some money to build the Babbage Analytical Engine.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:45.980]   We want to see it.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:46.980]   We want to touch it.
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:49.980]   We want to hear its thrumming motors.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.980]   It's giant steam engine.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:55.980]   It's 1.73 kilobytes of memory.
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:57.980]   Great to have you on again, John.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:59.980]   Thanks for staying up late with us.
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:00.980]   Thank you.
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:02.980]   I think I'm going to go to bed now.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:04.980]   Nine night.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:05.980]   It's late.
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:06.980]   Nine night.
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:08.980]   Let's one o'clock in the morning.
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:11.980]   Let's bank.com/babbage.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.980]   Give him $33.33.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:15.980]   That's really neat.
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:16.980]   Hey, thank you all for being here.
