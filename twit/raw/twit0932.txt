[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.840]   favorite social network and Google?

[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech!
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   Show where we get together with the best people I can find on short notice on Father's Day
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   and talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   Alex Wilhelm, a new father, actually showed up.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   I really thought you might be.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   No, no, no, no. I thought I would and I'm here and I'm going to miss bedtime tonight.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   So this is kind of like a vacation for me.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840]   So we need to make sure we make it to at least 7.15.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   And then actually...
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   That's a good Father's Day gift. Why is it due bedtime?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   Well, you know, she's not excited about it. She's a little bit annoyed.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   Because whenever I go on Twitter, I just disappear for the back half of the day.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   And now that we have a kid, it's actually slightly annoying that I disappear.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   Six months old?
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   She's insane.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   Six months old?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840]   And you love it? How are you feeling? You must...
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   You're kind of coming out of the exhaustion zone at this point, yes?
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   Yeah, coming out of that. I mean, what's...
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   If you don't have a kid, you haven't seen this.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   But the amazing thing is you'll wake up on, like I said earlier in the morning
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   and your child will have learned a new thing.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Like the weekend, a discovered, she had a tongue.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   She just stuck her tongue out for the reason.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   It was glorious.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   Learned her blow-razzberries.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   At the same time, she was eating solid food for the first time.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.840]   [laughter]
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   Or did this not cover...
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   It's hilarious.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   Like it's hilarious.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   Things you never thought were going to happen keep happening.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   And it keeps you on your toes.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   And yeah, I'm tired as hell, but I'm good.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   Congratulations. It's great to see you.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Alex works for TechCrunch and a variety of capacities.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   You do the podcast still, right?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   We are 600-some episodes in on that.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   Amazingly enough.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   Wow.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   What's it called?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   It's called... Oh, it's called Equity.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   If you want to learn more about venture capital and startups,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   and if you don't like those two things, you will hate that show.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   Well, I'm going to get you take on Spes in a second.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   Yes.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   But first, let's say hello to Ashley Esquetha.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   Always a pleasure to see Ashley.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   And how old is...
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   Always a pleasure to be here.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   How old is your baby now?
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   40.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   No, he's four.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   He's four going on 18, it feels like.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   Honestly, he is...
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   It's amazing.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840]   He's four now.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.840]   I can't believe it.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   He's a delight.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   His birthday is in a couple of weeks and we hired...
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   He's really into Star Wars.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   He's really into lightsabers, very specifically.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   Everything is a sword right now.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840]   Yes.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   A sword or a weapon.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   Yes.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   Everything's a weapon.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   Yes.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   And so we hired a Jedi to come to his birthday party.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.840]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   And teach the kids how to do lightsaber combat.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   And then Darth Vader is going to show up in a half hour later
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.840]   and then they all get to fight Darth Vader.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   That's incredible.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   Yeah, it'll be waiting for my mom of the year award.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   I'm waiting for that.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   So that'll be a really nice December.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   My mom gave me a stick for birthday.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840]   That was it.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   It's a sword.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.840]   Congratulations.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.840]   You got a sword for your birthday.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   I jumped off a wall landed on it, broken to three pieces.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   That was the end of that.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   Then you had three swords.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   Ashley's been busy though.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   Since you left CNET, you wrote a book coming out soon, right?
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840]   I did.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.840]   This summer, the Art of Psychonauts 2.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   If you love Double Fine, the game studio, if you happen to cross
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   the 32-episode "Psychotacy" documentary, which was just recently
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   made eligible for the Emmys, which is really cool.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   I wrote the art book about it.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   So it's a real nice companion piece.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   It's massive.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   For 50 bucks, you get 400 pages of amazing Psychonauts art.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   It is a certain style, isn't it?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   That's like a good style.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   Beautiful.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   The spoke.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   Everything's bespoke, which is really incredible.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   It's hand painted.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   It's all hand painted.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   It's all hand painted.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   Well, the concept art team is just a machine.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   They're from their character designers to their 3D artists.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   It's just an amazing team of...
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   You could kind of tell.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.840]   I think that's one of the things that makes the Psychonauts such a
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   great game is you can kind of tell.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   Yeah, that's what it's...
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   Human made it.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   Yes.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   Well, there's a philosophy that they follow called the Psychonauts
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   "Wonk" in that specific game, which is really interesting.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.840]   We dive into that in the book.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   There are three very specific rules, and it makes the world
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   kind of what it looks like, which is pretty neat.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   Ashley has just launched a new business.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.840]   We'll talk about that too, in a little bit.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   Rowdy Skeleton.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   I love the name.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   But first, speaking of skeletons, let's talk about Reddit.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   [clears throat]
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   Holy cow.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   Holy cow.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   And I'm sad.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   You know, I kind of seen this happen with...
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   It's kind of slow motion with Twitter.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   And apparently Steve Huffman, who is the current CEO and one of
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   the original founders of Reddit, admires Elon Musk and is kind of
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   following along in the Elon Musk Playbook, which seems demented.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   That doesn't seem...
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   You know, I was just reading Casey's...
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   Casey Liss, a platformer?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.840]   Casey Newton's.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   Yeah, Casey Newton's bit about Twitter.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.840]   I was talking about...
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   This is actually like maybe one of the worst acquisitions in the history of Wall Street.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   And so I'm like, I don't know that that's anything that you would like to aspire to.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   Do you really want...
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   Like it seems like a bad idea.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   You want to emulate that.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   The latest Twitter news is they're getting kicked out of their offices in Colorado
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   because they're in Boulder because they didn't pay the rent, which they're not doing in every
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   other office as well, including San Francisco, the headquarters in England.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   Apparently the royal estate is suing them for rent.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.840]   I don't think you should really stiff the king, but maybe that's just me.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   And now they also have announced they're not going to pay their Google Cloud bills, which is kind of problematic.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   I'm going to correct myself here.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   This is actually from the thing that Casey posted at Xerp.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   And it was from a Puck News post.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   Puck is great.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   I subscribe.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   I pay for a Puck.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   Will Elon lose control of Twitter as the name of the article?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   It was very interesting.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   I pay for platformer Casey Newton's and I pay for a Puck.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   Oh yeah.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   I don't know.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   We got sidetracked from Reddit.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   We'll get back to it in a moment, folks.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Don't worry.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   We're not going to talk about Elon all day.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840]   We have.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.840]   But we've got new villains in town.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   I do think it looks like, although Elon at their latest upfront said ad sales are up 40%, but when I go to Twitter and I look at what they're selling ads to, if I have to see that stupid airplane ad one more time, I'm just going to plots.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   So I'm thinking that I block them.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   Oh, you block them.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   I buy it.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   You can block promoted.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   Yeah, I just block them.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   It's most of them.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   I'm just like, this is junk.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   It's all junk.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   It feels like I've seen on TV.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   It feels like I'm watching late night infomercials.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   That's what it is.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   It's all that crap.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   I don't think you should replace your weed wacker with a spinning steel blade.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   That seems like a bad idea.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   I don't.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   That's a real thing.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   That's a real thing.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   The steel wire cutter trimmer head never breaks.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   No, but you might.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   It will break you.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   It will break you.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   Why would you put a blade on something unshielded?
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.840]   That seems so dumb.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   Like, oh, yeah.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   Well, you know, it could do is you could put a chainsaw on it.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   That would really work.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   Why not just?
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.840]   Why not just put a chainsaw at the end?
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840]   It's just like Legend of Zelda.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   You just fuse a chainsaw with a stick.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   That's just, that's it.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   It just go forward and you can just do your own things.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.840]   Maybe that's where all of the New Silicon Valley ideas will come from tears of the kingdom.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   Oh, so you just can block those and you'll never see them again.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   I just block them.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   Like, there are some like larger companies that I haven't blocked because they're, you
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   know, they're still advertising.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   Like I have a block McDonald's because they have totally unhinged content sometimes.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   But yeah, like I most of I just small come.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   I just block them.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   So Burfi Mart, which is by the way, I don't know if that's inspired or a terrible name,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   but I can just say chat GPT wrote that name.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   I can block Burfi Mart.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   Chat GPT probably came up with the idea of putting a blade on a weed wacker, too.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   That sounds like exactly what a, what an evil computer program would say.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   Give me ideas from the low cost, low cost products with an element of danger.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   Give me 50 product ideas and Burfi Mart.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   So this is William Cohen, who actually has a lot of MNA experience, right?
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   Alex, he's a smart guy.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   Writing on Puck saying what seems likely is that the banks are just going to save.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   Okay.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   You're done.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   You've had your fun.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   You've had your fun.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   They have 13 billion dollars worth of debt.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   Elon apparently is making the interest payments, which we thought he might not even do.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   Next one's due in September.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   He made the first two that I saw, but I did a little math on the ad numbers that they had
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.000]   for, I think it was late 2022 and then the start of this year compared to their historical
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.120]   revenue results and then kind of figured out their debt payments.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.760]   The company might be making enough money to do that, but I think when you calculate it
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.320]   also in like cloud expenses and personnel and so forth, it's probably pretty far in the
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.640]   red still.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.440]   And I don't think it's going to change because I don't think it's becoming a better place
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:52.320]   to be and not to open up this particular kind of worms, but Twitter today was mostly Elon
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.680]   and Joe Rogan, bullying a pediatrician.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   Oh my God.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680]   Yes.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.680]   You know what?
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.280]   I actually said that's it.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.720]   I'm done because I was using Twitter read only.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.640]   And the fact that they can gang up on Peter Hotez who is, you know, this guy went to school
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.360]   and studied this stuff.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.480]   He's a he's an MD.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.640]   He's a immunologist.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.160]   He is a public health expert.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.640]   And for Joe Rogan and RFK Jr. and Elon Musk to say, oh no, we know better is in fear.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.640]   It's infuriating.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.800]   And now they're saying, well, if you really, if you're right, you should debate us on the
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.320]   Joe Rogan show to which Peter is wisely saying no.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.920]   Do you want to sit there for three hours with the guy who made people eat bugs on television
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.800]   and try to talk about your life's work?
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.320]   It's not the intellectual dark web.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.480]   It's the intellectual web of Dweeds like these people are pathetic and small minded.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.800]   And what's bad here isn't just that they apparently now just are the only personalities
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.160]   on Twitter that matter in terms of reach, but also they're going to get people killed.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.760]   And I'm not in favor of this information that leads to that's my point.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.840]   It's a celebrity's health outcome.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.960]   It's fine if biology wants to bet a million dollars that Bitcoin is going to get to a
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   million dollars.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   I bet what he lost.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.520]   I hope somebody collected on that.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.240]   But when you're talking about public health, this is not a play.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.760]   And the problem is a lot of people, I think, see this and believe it.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.760]   They don't.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.080]   Oh, 100%.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.720]   They take what he would Rogan says is gospel.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.320]   This is like a very, even though, you know, he'll say like, wow, I didn't know that.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   Hey, look that up on Google.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.600]   And it's like, oh, God, like no.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.160]   But yeah, I mean, I think I just, for me, can boil it down to what Mark Twain has said
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.280]   famously, which is never argue with a fool.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.160]   They'll simply bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:46.040]   So it's just you can't argue with people who come, you know, prepared with bad faith
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.080]   arguments and, you know, these sort of like, they just, there's no changing minds there.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.200]   And I think that it's just like, we just want you to come on and then and then crow to people
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.560]   that we owned you.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   Like it's, it's about winning.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   It's kind of an actual thing.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.000]   It's the Ben Shapiro method of debate, which is just try to just talk over people and then
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   claim that you want.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I like that.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.720]   Mark Twain quote though, I'm mortally with the, the porcine version, which is don't
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.760]   wrestle with the pig because you'll both get dirty and the pig will enjoy it.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   Yes.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.960]   Just a very similar kind of argument there.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   Indeed.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.640]   I think it was Lyndon Johnson actually said that.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.800]   Oh, thank you for the historical reference.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.560]   I want to go back to the, the Reddit Elon point that comes here because I think that when people
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.280]   are discussing in a business context, the, the desire to emulate Elon, what they mean
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.520]   more than how Elon has particularly run Twitter's ad business per se is more that run a much
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.160]   smaller company, but that's much leaner.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.760]   And with much less, I would say, employees say and how things are done.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.480]   I don't think Elon Musk is part of the, the pro union caucus, in other words.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.400]   And so if you can work your employees more and get more out of them for a less kind of
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.040]   overall costly cost basis, well, then why not?
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.480]   And I think Spaz is trying to get his company public.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   And I think he's struggling with that.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.240]   Let's go through the history.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   Well, that's right.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   Let's go through the backstory.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.360]   So, so we could talk about, by the way, there's a lot, there's a lot happening with
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   Reddit.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.840]   Like that has led us to this point of like, there's literal Reddit blackout in some of
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.000]   the more different stories.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.960]   By the way, not LBJ, GBS, George Bernard Shaw, Neville, wrestle with pigs.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.920]   You both get dirty and the pig likes it.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.840]   Oh, that's, that's you.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   I was close.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:30.120]   But yeah, even better mark between Mark Twain, George Bernard Shaw and Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.680]   We got it covered.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:38.840]   So it all started not so long ago, Twitter decided, not Twitter, Reddit decided they
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.360]   wanted to go public.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.520]   I'm sure you covered this Alex when it happened.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.720]   But what are their prospects for an IPO?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Good.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   What were their prospects?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   Well, they're filed privately.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   Okay.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   I'm just pulling that up now.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   I forgot.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   So December 16th, 2021.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   So they filed privately.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   That's a long time ago.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.120]   They can do.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.440]   But keep in mind, what was going on in late 2021?
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   It was the apex.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   It was the peak of the last asset in venture capital boom.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.080]   So they filed probably with great aspirations to go public right before everything changed
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.040]   and would kind of hell, frankly.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.080]   So I think they're probably dealing with some impatient bankers and backers.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.280]   They wanted to go public.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.560]   I think you also argue that wasn't, oh, sorry, Leo.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.760]   Don't you also argue that like, this is sort of a very similar problem that a lot of
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.600]   tech companies had, which was they saw this like meta is a really good example of this
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.680]   where they saw a huge boom in users during the time when everyone was staying home and
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.000]   locked down with nothing to do but be on the internet or use their meta quest and decided
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.160]   that that was going to be the new normal and that they somehow convinced people, oh, yeah,
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.480]   these are our new normal numbers.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.480]   There's always be this way.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.720]   I mean, a great example of that was Roblox.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   Right?
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.360]   I mean, Roblox was doing a simply insanely amazing business at the time.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.960]   Just in Coinbase was very similar.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.480]   Money was just raining down from the sky.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.480]   Incredible profits.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.840]   These companies looked bulletproof and generation making sources of wealth, but things changed.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.880]   And so Reddit, I think, is dealing with, yes, it changed in the valuations climate and also
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.800]   as everyone in the podcast world knows Leo, a decline in overall ad spend.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.040]   And so it's a tougher market for them.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.320]   And I think where you're going next is how they reacted to that.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.760]   Well, let me ask first, have they ever had a profit?
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.160]   It's hard to say.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.880]   I don't probably think so because they sold back in the day for not that much money and
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.040]   then they got other forms of investment.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.760]   They were acquired by Conde Nast.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   Conde spun it off as a standalone, although they still hold the majority of shares.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:43.400]   They filed for the private IPO a couple of years ago, but didn't do anything about it.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.000]   And they were apparently, according to the information planning, this IPO, this is from
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.200]   a story of Valentine's Day.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.680]   So a few months ago, in the second half, we are in the second half, by the way, or we
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.520]   will soon be in the second half.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.960]   Hard to be due to a good IP.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.960]   Is it Alex?
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.200]   You're an expert.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.400]   Can you do an IPO if you've never turned a profit?
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.800]   So you can.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.680]   It depends a little bit on how your business is set up.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.240]   A lot of software companies, for example, will go public when they're growing pretty
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.160]   quickly but still consuming cash.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.720]   And then people expect their growth rate to slowly end over time and then become more
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.520]   profitable, a bit like Salesforce or Microsoft or whatever.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.000]   The issue that Reddit has is that it's a social media company, kind of.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.880]   And so it's comps are not Salesforce or Atlassian, they're meta or snap or Pinterest.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.680]   And those companies tend to trade at lower multiples.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:37.440]   And so I think there's by less market willingness to allow them to go public if they're unprofitable
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.120]   or more importantly, if they're still consuming a lot of cash.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.320]   Because you can be cash-lopositive and still unprofitable under gap terms.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.720]   And I know that's too deep, but the point is profits a little squishy.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.880]   And so I don't think we know offhand how well Reddit's doing on that metric, but because
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.680]   they haven't gone public yet, Leo, I presume the answer is not so well.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.360]   Well, and that's probably why they filed in 2021, but still never went public because
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.200]   they were waiting for something.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.920]   Something to get better, market conditions, the market itself, or perhaps their own profitability.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.160]   As far as I know, they've never had a part turned to profit.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.920]   So they have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, right?
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.400]   Last round of funding was a $10 billion valuation in 2021.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   That might encourage you.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.040]   You know, all were worth 10 billion.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   I seem so high.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:38.520]   It was reportedly opening for a $15 billion valuation on the market.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.640]   They were on the precipice, according to the information of going public last year, but
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.720]   then hit pause.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:51.680]   Meanwhile, Fidelity, who has, by the way, valued Twitter at 13 billion, interesting number,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.600]   Fidelity valued Reddit at $6.6 billion.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.840]   So there is some gap between what Reddit thinks it's worth and what everybody else might think
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   it's worth.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.360]   In any event, it was clear, I think, probably at the highest levels of Reddit, we got to
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.320]   figure out a way to make more money, right?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.560]   If we're going to go, what a great idea, Leo.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.160]   Nothing wrong after that.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.480]   Initially, their initial, so here's what they, I think, did.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.240]   They look at the balance sheet.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.200]   They say, well, we have this much revenue.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.600]   You know, we have advertising.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.840]   It wasn't a great advertising platform, but they have advertising.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.000]   I pay for Reddit.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.680]   There is a subscription system for Reddit.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.120]   And then they're looking at their bandwidth bills.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.680]   And they're saying, well, you know what's interesting?
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.720]   More than half of our bandwidth, I'm guessing a number, but I would guess more than half
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.960]   our bandwidth isn't serving our webpage or our apps.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.240]   It's serving third party apps.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.080]   That's costing us some large amount of money.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.680]   We should monetize that.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.120]   Oh, by the way, no third party app has ads.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.200]   So we're not monetizing the third party apps at all.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.880]   And so Steve Hoffman, who started Reddit with Alexis O'Hanean and Aaron Schwartz a couple
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.840]   of months later, and came back as CEO after a Reddit had a very rocky up and down leadership
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.440]   problem, Ellen Powell, for instance, who left, you know, furious, I'm sure, with the boys'
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.760]   club.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.840]   So Steve took it, said, I'm going to, no, it's my company.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   I started it.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   I'm going to run it.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   I'm going to run it.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.360]   Steve says, well, I know one way we can make some more money is cut off these third party
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   apps.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.000]   Look, Elon just did it on Twitter.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.280]   In fact, Twitter has done it before.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.440]   Third party apps suck bandwidth and don't show your ads.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   So Twitter cut off the third party a long time ago.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.040]   They slowly came back.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:52.440]   Elon cut it off in a very ugly fashion late last year when he just turned off the API
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.160]   and put a lot of companies in mortal danger.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.040]   So I think what happened is, is Hoffman said, what we're not going to be evil like Twitter.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.840]   We're going to let them know.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.320]   Unfortunately, he gave them one month and the API costs they proposed, I think, correct
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.400]   me if I'm wrong, were 24 cents per thousand hits.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.600]   For a thousand calls.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.440]   Yeah, I think that matches money.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.200]   It was a lot of money.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.280]   That's a huge amount of money.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.320]   The number one Reddit app, an app I use in love, because by the way, we should also mention
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.480]   Reddit does have iOS and Android apps.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   They're unusable.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.480]   They're awful.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.520]   I did not know there were third party iOS apps on Reddit or for Reddit.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.280]   And so I've been using the official one and oh my God, it's often is not good.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.600]   Yes, but Apollo, written by a guy named Christian Selig is fantastic.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   And there's others.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.480]   Reddit is fun riff on Android.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.160]   I use Joey on Android for a long time.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   There's normal.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.680]   There is a fairly rich ecosystem of third party apps.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:59.120]   Christian Selig on a phone call talking to them, they said 24 cents for a thousand calls.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120]   He did some math.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.920]   He said, that's going to cost me $20 million a year.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.960]   To which they said, yeah, and so better put some ads on there.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.440]   Better do something.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.200]   Well, what spes is Steve Hoffman's handle on Twitter?
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.760]   What he said was, well, just charge your users for that.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.520]   If five bucks a user, you're going to be great.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   It's more complicated than that.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:31.600]   He's got grandfather users because of fees from Apple, for instance, which takes 30%
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.240]   and the credit cards.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.320]   It would not be $5.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.880]   He would actually, he said, he was on a Tech News Weekly this week.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.680]   On Thursday, he told Micah and Jason Howell, I would lose 10 cents a user if I charged
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.520]   five bucks a month.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.480]   He reasonably says, I can't charge more than five bucks a month.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.360]   He says, I'm out of business end of the month.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.720]   Now, I'm sure he's made a good living.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.760]   Apollo was, I think, well funded.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.880]   He had a lot of users and I paid for it.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.960]   A lot of people did.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.880]   riff also said, yeah, we're going to cut the cord in the month.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.120]   We can't pay this.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.880]   Our third party apps said, all right, we're out of business.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.040]   But this bothered the users.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:18.480]   I think one of the problems that one of the problems Elon and Huffman have is they forget.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.040]   They think people go to Twitter because of the software.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.320]   They think people go to Reddit because of the software.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.120]   People don't go to Twitter and Reddit because of your fabulous software, because of your
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.600]   servers, because of your trust and safety.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.640]   They go there because of the other people, the content, which is all made in fact,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.120]   little which is made for free for free by those users.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:47.600]   Reddit's even more in debt because Reddit uses volunteer mods who really put in the
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   time.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.760]   I mean, I might post it in the work, but that's hard work.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.640]   The mods are upset because a lot of the tools they use the API and oh, by the way, they
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.680]   prefer the third party apps anyway.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.160]   So the mods are upset.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.320]   So they said, well, we're going to have a little boycott June 12th through 15th.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.560]   And about half the, I think was about half the mods, half the subreddits, the channels
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   on Reddit went dark.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.560]   Right?
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.640]   It was a lot.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:25.600]   To which stuff goes on a very ill advised publicity tour gives interviews to the Verge
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.560]   NPR and BC and says the moderators are landed gentry.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.440]   They're, you know, they're, they're, they are the problem.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.480]   We're going to make it possible for the users to vote the mods out.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.400]   And we're going to force these communities to reopen.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.560]   And that really pissed people off.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   The my favorite one is our slash pics, which decided, so iPhone, for instance, went dark
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   forever.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.440]   They said, move to, move to discord.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.400]   We're going to have a discord channel.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.440]   Our slash pics decided we're only going to post pictures.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.280]   It's a place where you post your pictures.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.760]   We're only going to post pictures of John Oliver from now on.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.440]   And it's all John Oliver all the time.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.200]   What a great protest, by the way.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.400]   You're using up the servers, the bandwidth.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.520]   Here's an up server bandwidth to put John Oliver on your subreddit.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   Very good.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   Very good use.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   Very good use.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   Very good.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.520]   But here's the, like Reddit.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   This is what Reddit is best at, right?
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.600]   It's like this sort of like.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.040]   This is the culture.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.200]   It's like it's, it's this like, this is exactly Reddit culture.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.920]   I've been, I've been on Reddit.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.760]   I, I don't even want to say how long I've been on Reddit because it's going to age me,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.760]   like too much.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.160]   But like literally I've been on Reddit a long time.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.120]   Like I love, I love Reddit.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.920]   I love so many of these communities.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.800]   Like there are so, so many of the funniest people I've ever encountered on the internet.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.600]   I've seen on Reddit, like some of the funniest stories I've ever read have been on Reddit.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.400]   And you know, this is exactly the kind of like good chaos Reddit is known for.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.640]   Like a lot of, you know, there are some other less good communities that have, you know,
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.840]   kind of moved on or have been sort of shadow banned.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:21.720]   But the thing is, is like, you know, collectively there is a chaotic good about most of like
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:28.280]   mainstream Reddit that when harnessed and, and, and pointed in a certain direction can
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   be very powerful.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.480]   Well, and it's interesting because Steve Hoffman, who you would think would understand the
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.320]   culture completely.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   You'd think so.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.760]   misunderstood how users would react.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.880]   He sent an memo to the team saying, hey, don't go outside in your Reddit gear because
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.960]   you'll get tomatoes thrown at you and be it'll all pass.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   Don't worry.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.120]   This is just, you know, these are babies.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.960]   They're landed gentry.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.320]   They're going to wine and moan and everything will be back to normal.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   Is he right?
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.880]   No, I don't think so.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.420]   No, I think I think going back to Leo's comment about how people don't go to Twitter and
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.080]   Reddit for the software is actually a bit of an understatement given that Reddit and Twitter
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.040]   have famously crap servers.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   Yes, the terrible.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.720]   Yeah, the two apps that still don't work.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.080]   Somehow in 2023, in the era of multipolical environment, they can get their interest rate.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.720]   So no, I think people only come to the community and people are going to leave and find other
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   options slowly.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:31.640]   I mean, I have to say I've looked, you know, there's a Fediverse thing called Lemme.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.160]   There's a cave, cave bill, cave it, but there isn't really anything.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.960]   There's discord, I guess.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   There's nothing like.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.280]   It's hard because it's like, it's not easily browsable.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.280]   Right?
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.560]   It's like, you have to know what you want.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.420]   Like when I go and I want to join a community like club to it, like I'm, I know what I'm
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.920]   looking for and that's what I join, but it's like when on Reddit, you can just surf Reddit
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.360]   and find a community that you didn't know existed.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.760]   You know, it's like, maybe you don't go to, you know, maybe you never would have found
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.880]   a community had you not just seen a post surface, a really hot post surface on Reddit.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   And then you find like this really great community, like a restoration, our restoration
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.240]   is like one of my favorite Reddit communities.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   Like, I love seeing people restore photos.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   I find it terribly fascinating.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.280]   And I would have never found that had it not just popped up on my feed one day because
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.880]   one of the posts was, was really blowing up.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.800]   And so I went in there and I'm like, Oh my God, I love this.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   I love this subreddit.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   I'm going to hang out in here.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.520]   And so I, you know, join the subreddit.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.840]   So the discoverability factor, I think is really a key thing that makes Reddit different
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.000]   from any of its potential competitors, like a discord.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.400]   I think discord in particular would be the one that would come to mind first.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.880]   But I don't Twitter have the have the advantage that if you want to know what the zeitgeist
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.600]   is of the internet, you can go there and you can quickly get a handle on what people
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.160]   are talking about, what people care about.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.360]   And so for me, it's hugely vat.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.200]   They're both very, very valuable.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.760]   Furthermore, Reddit is valuable for a lot of people who instead of searching Google, they
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.160]   will add site colon Reddit.com on their Google searches.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   Because I do think it's much more useful information.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.400]   Better, better results, better results all the time.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.120]   Who is going to suffer from this?
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.600]   We should also point out, and perhaps this is what got the, what got Huffman in the board
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:30.160]   upset is that open AI was in all probability trained on the entirety of Reddit.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.160]   They know exactly how much open AI sucked from Reddit.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.600]   And it probably was a huge amount and they're looking at open AI's valuation and then seeing
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.240]   fidelity cut their valuation by half might have pissed them off.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.800]   Alex, you don't think it's going to survive this?
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.360]   Well, I think I was actually going to bring up the point.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   So I'm glad you did.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:54.120]   I really do think that we need to figure out some way to receive compensation for work
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.360]   that is ingested into AI products that has been sold to other people.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.120]   Like that just seems very reasonable to me.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.320]   The reason why I don't worry as much about discoverability or the other issues that are
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.960]   very clear when we talk about why Twitter and Reddit are still around is because I don't
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.120]   think there's going to be a one to one replacement for them right away.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.960]   But I do think there's a slow poison effect to this Leo.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.080]   Like whenever I'm on Twitter now, I feel like I'm helping Elon make his Pinterest payments.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.720]   And now when I'm on Reddit, I feel like I'm helping somebody who tried to union bust unpaid
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.920]   mods.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.440]   And so it just takes away some of the spark and joy for me.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.200]   And that means I'm probably going to use it less and less over time, slow poison.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.760]   So I think it's our Reddit's best days ahead of it.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.120]   I think you'd be hard for us to find someone who said, yeah, this is the direct direction
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   to go in.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.480]   And I think it's going to take a couple of years to play out.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.440]   But I wouldn't be surprised if we're past peak Reddit now.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.920]   There's also a, yeah, it poisons a good word because it isn't going to go away any more
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.440]   than Twitter went away.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.640]   But if half the sub-readits that I follow went away, yeah.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.320]   I could still go to Reddit and get some of what I got.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   But maybe I wouldn't even notice, but there's going to be some thinning of the quality.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.960]   Plus the people are going to stick around who are insensitive to what's happening.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.400]   Maybe not the people I want to follow.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.760]   I want to follow.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   You talked about Reddit's culture, Ashley.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.920]   There was a very quirky, unique culture.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.160]   And I have to think a lot of the people who contribute to that will leave if they haven't
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160]   already left.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:31.320]   Yeah, I mean, well, there's a lot of moderators who, or bots, people who build bots.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.480]   That's another aspect of Reddit that I think a lot of people really appreciate.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.320]   Like regardless of whether it's a super useful bot or a silly or bot, you know, there are
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.000]   people who put in that work even on Reddit.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.680]   And so it's just, it's a real, it's a real house of cards because once you start removing
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:55.120]   people who are conduits for the zeitgeist, then all of a sudden there is no zeitgeist
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.760]   you can't get that temperature check.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.040]   And then that's when those people who get the temperature checks on Reddit start using
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.360]   it even less.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.000]   You know, it's just, it's a real cascading effect.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.720]   And you know, you have to appreciate that your users are utilizing your service in order
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   to connect with each other and also create content that other people like.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.320]   And so to kind of fly in the face of that and ignore it is really, it's like shocking
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.720]   to me as someone who co-founded Reddit.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:31.120]   Like you said, Leo, like it's shocking to me that Spes is so defiant in this.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.840]   But I think this speaks to that like overall problem and sorry, my dog's barking at a
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   squirrel outside if anyone can hear it.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.840]   Squat.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.680]   He's just going absolutely bananas right now.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.720]   The sun came out for a day and he's like, I've had it with any living creature in this
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   yard.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.320]   But I think it's really speaks to this kind of growth at all costs forever.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.800]   That's just unsustainable.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.760]   It's just an unsustainable business model.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.600]   This like, oh, we must have your over your growth every year in perpetuity.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.520]   Like it's just not a thing that's realistic.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:11.080]   And you know, to be able to sit there and call your moderators who work for free, you're
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.520]   calling them land and gentry.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.920]   I mean, it's just absolutely.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   Oh my God.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   So.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   So.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.120]   And then you think you're going to have to go to the website.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.320]   And then you're going to have to go to the website and go to the website.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   And then you're going to have to go to the website.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   And then you're going to have to go to the website.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.720]   And then you're going to have to go to the website.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   And then you're going to have to go to the website.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.320]   And then you're going to have to go to the website and then you're going to have to go.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.520]   And then you're going to have to go to the website.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.880]   The work that makes Reddit great, the company doesn't do, whereas the search results that
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.440]   made Google special when it did go public were actually the company's work.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.800]   And so to me, there's just a misunderstanding of where the value comes from this company.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.040]   And I think that that's leading to some poor choices.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.440]   And this may end up driving enough nourishment revenue to go public and Spes will get fed
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.880]   it for that and patted on the shoulder and given his block of money and fine capitalism.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.640]   But you know, as someone who's been on Reddit now for 14 years, according to my profiles
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.280]   pulled up and I was a charter member of what was then called Reddit gold.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.360]   I'm disappointed that the site that I spent so much time on is apparently forgetting who
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.880]   it is and who made it worth what it may be worth to the market sometime.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.360]   It's just, it's just, it's a bummer.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.560]   But also, you know, red's been around for a long time.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.480]   Maybe this had to go the way of Facebook at some point, right?
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.280]   All ad based properties eventually decay into the point in which they commit suicide.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280]   Google searches a good example.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:42.200]   As the, as Kerry Doctor called it, the inshitification of the internet, it's what happens.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.360]   Corey's been doing a lot of great writing lately.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.440]   We should give him five points for that because he's been really just just crushing it.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.800]   Bloodshot gun to the, to the, to the side guys.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.640]   I think he's been doing it.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.680]   I've really appreciated it.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.680]   He's the right person for the right time.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   The right time.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.880]   I'm like, him, Casey Newton, like I'm really enjoying, I'm really enjoying Casey's work
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   as well.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.640]   I think, you know, and also like, I'm really enjoying Cara Swisher just not giving an
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.440]   F about anything ever.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.000]   Like, like seeing her on, she never did.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   She never did.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.640]   But, but even more so now, like she just, it's, it's like every minute of every day she
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.920]   becomes more powerful.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.240]   And it's just really, that's like an exciting thing for me to see on Twitter.com.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.440]   That's like one of the, again, as I, she is a conduit for the zeitgeist.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.200]   And I love, I love seeing her takes.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.600]   Um, for that reason.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.040]   But if you're on the other side of Cara though, it's tough.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.640]   Like, don't ever be on the other side of Cara.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   That's my best advice.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.240]   Yeah, you may actually, but I think I've met Cara like by four or five times.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.360]   Um, back when I was much more on like the tech circuit, if you will.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.280]   And like every time we met, she looked at me and her sunglasses, I was like, who are
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   you?
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.720]   And I'm like, we met four times.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.560]   And so she, she somehow makes you feel about two inches tall.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.120]   It's, she's a, she is a formidable human being.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.080]   I am, I'm scared of her.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.000]   Like fully admitted, I'm scared of her, but like in a good way.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.080]   Like I, I see her on Twitter and I'm like, I'm so, I would never want to be in your crosshairs,
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.160]   but also like keep, keep on keeping on.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.040]   You know, the, the point about like what Corey is doing and what Casey are doing to me actually
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.600]   hits me kind of in the heart because I feel like they are writing about and thinking about
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.080]   the most important things today in like the world of digital.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.760]   And I feel like my professional niche is sufficiently far from the current like crosshairs.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.960]   But I'm, I'm almost like missing the moment based on what I do for a living.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.120]   I kind of was like, I was more, you know, come on.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:47.440]   FOMO is, is an absolute continuous, uh, from background radiation for anybody in our business.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.000]   Constantly, constantly.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.200]   I have Joe Mo now.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.000]   I have joy of missing out.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I'm not.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   I don't.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.240]   I know, I mean, look, I was reading that poetry earlier, uh, about for Father's Day.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.680]   I can't read it on the air because it's profane by Philip Larkin.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.240]   And I'm thinking, how did I not become a poet?
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:13.560]   So I know why, I know why, well, it's because even you and I will never commit such financial
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.000]   as it was like as to pursue poetry.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.560]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.840]   Because we were not born with a billionaire parent.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.840]   There you go.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   That's why.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.240]   All right, let's.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.600]   So the prognosis for Reddit, not good.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.320]   Steve, clearly I, do it to people go crazy.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.080]   They get to a certain age and they lose their marbles.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.920]   What happened to Steve?
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.360]   Uh, he wrote the thing.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   He's the money.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   He's the money.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   It's money.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.040]   He's the money sees it's like, people, everybody wants that.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.720]   Everybody wants like the bank account of Elon Musk.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.760]   Everybody wants the Zuckerberg treatment.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:54.920]   It's like it's just, you know, it's the lure is too, it's too shiny.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.240]   It's too exciting.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   Money is the root of all evil.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   I guess.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.560]   I mean, curse me with a bit more of it.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   I mean, I won't say maybe.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.080]   Well, I know it's true.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.200]   Maybe the, this phrase should be adjusted.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.480]   Not having money is the root of all evil, but wanting more.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.880]   The only thing worse than having too much money is not having enough.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.920]   I can see the way that I can put that.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   That's good.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.480]   George Bernard Shaw, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   Like that.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.440]   George Bernard, we'll get LBJ, AKA Mark Twain.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.200]   We're just going through history today on the show.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.280]   All I know is the rich or not like you and me.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.480]   Uh, let us take a break.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.120]   Ashley, is here.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   Great to have you.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.960]   Ashley, we'll talk about Rowdy Skeleton, your new enterprise in just a little bit.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.480]   Alex Wilhelm also here from TechCrunch.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   The equity podcast and of course he writes for TechCrunch.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.400]   And I read you religiously because that's the only way I can figure out what the hell's
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.840]   going on in the finance world.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.440]   Uh, it's just, it's crazy time.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.800]   It's crazy time.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:06.120]   Our show today, I should mention our fine sponsor brought to you by is crazy time out
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   there.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:13.160]   So you need Cisco duo, duo protects against breaches with the leading access management
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   suite.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.600]   Man, nowadays breach is such a problem.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.520]   Just had a caller on the, the Aztetec I showed earlier today.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.120]   I said, Oh yeah.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   You know, on Thursday, the Louisiana Department of Motor Vehicles announced that almost everybody
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.160]   in Louisiana's information has been stolen by a breach.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.000]   Like everything gone.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.840]   That's why you need.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.280]   Don't let this happen to you.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:43.120]   Strong, multi-layered defenses and innovative capabilities that allow only legitimate
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.200]   users in, keep the bad actors out.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.360]   And if suddenly you get the urge, suddenly you say, you wake up and say, we got to do
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.000]   this now.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.200]   If you need protection fast, you can be sure duo is easy and fast to implement.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.760]   It can quickly enable strong security.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.720]   And by the way, without impeding your productivity, your employee productivity, in fact, it can
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   improve it.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.480]   And I'll tell you how I'll explain this.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:18.240]   Duo prevents unauthorized access with multi-layered defenses and modern capabilities that thwart
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.960]   sophisticated malicious access attempts.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.840]   You need that, right?
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:29.400]   And even better, because Cisco and Duo are constantly monitoring the threat landscape,
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.440]   it will automatically increase authentication requirements in real time as the risk rises.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.760]   Now, how does this help high productivity?
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.680]   Because it only requires authentication when needed.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.160]   So your users aren't going to say, it's harder to get in.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.280]   No, it's swift, it's easy, but it's also secure.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.920]   Duo also provides an all-in-one solution for strong multi-factor authentication, for password
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   lists.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.400]   That's all the rage these days.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.360]   Single sign-on and trusted endpoint verification.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:06.560]   Duo helps you implement zero trust principles by verifying users and their devices.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.960]   And that's good for everyone.

[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.160]   I love that short URL.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.480]   That's so good.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.480]   CS.CO/twitforsiscoduo.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:25.760]   They say, "Spell it out."
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.480]   Honestly, I don't know how you could do it without spelling it out.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.160]   CS.CO, I guess I could say that.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   CS.CO/twitforsiscoduo.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   It's a great song.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:37.440]   T-W-I-T for CS.CO/duo.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.760]   It's a great solution.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:45.800]   I'm just loving these photos of John Oliver.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.600]   But it makes me sad because I -- r/iphone I use all the time.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   There are a lot of --
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   Same.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.640]   Yeah, there are a lot of subreddits.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.320]   And I feel a little guilty because I probably should have rewarded my -- I don't know.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.640]   Is there a way to reward mods?
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.440]   You should thank your mod.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   Give gold.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   Give gold.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   I should give more gold.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.320]   I have lots of gold.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.480]   Give more gold.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:16.320]   Well speaking of annoying big tech, Google has decided they are going to offload Google
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   domains.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.800]   I don't know why I'm running this up top except it's pissing me off.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.440]   Google domains, which was actually a very good way to buy a domain name.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.240]   They had 300 TLDs.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.120]   It wasn't the cheapest but it was certainly affordable.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:39.720]   And now they sold it to Squarespace.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.600]   There's a funny account called Killed by Google and all it does is track different products
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.800]   that Google kills off.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.920]   And I'm pretty sure when this happened they had the best day ever.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.680]   They're like, "Yes, I was right."
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.920]   I think the pitch here, Leo, was focused.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.160]   But I mean, it seems pretty sure I decided to kill off all the things that built consumer
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.800]   surplus at the company.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   Nine years long.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.360]   I mean, look, we have a sponsor hover, which is a great domain registrar and that's what
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   I use.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.360]   That's what I use.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.080]   It's not like there's a shortage of good domain registrars.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.520]   But I have to feel for all the people who registered their domain at Google domains that
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.000]   soon going to be owned by Squarespace.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.680]   I'd be so annoyed.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.920]   I would be so annoyed.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:28.680]   There will be a transition period, Squarespace takes it all over.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.520]   Ten million domains hosted on Google domains, millions of customers.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:39.760]   Google said, "We're sharpening our focus, sharpening their knives."
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:49.080]   This is right after, by the way, Google announced the .zip TLD, which is a security nightmare.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.440]   So this was like their last hurrah.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.560]   Okay, we're going to introduce a TLD that could really hack your computer and then we're
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.880]   going to sell the business.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.880]   Goodbye.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:07.480]   MOV2.MOV, which also is like, what it, what, why don't you just buy .pdf?
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.560]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.360]   I don't, like, oh yes, you can find me at Ashley Iskela.pdf.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.360]   Like what?
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   Oh my God.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:22.600]   I mean, is that the only way it could have been worse is if they had also offered that
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   .pdf.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.080]   Because in fact, Steve covered this on security now last week.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.960]   You know, you put a link on a, in an email or website that's, you know, download .zip
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   or whatever.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.720]   It goes to a website, downloads in the background, a malicious file.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.960]   I mean, it's a terrible idea.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.840]   Come see our website.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   Well, Squarespace now is .zip and .move as well.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.000]   Take my advice, Squarespace.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.280]   Discontinue those immediately.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.240]   I don't know how what is Google feels like it's shredding before our very eyes.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.200]   Well, this is like pretty classic Google stuff.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.920]   I mean, they've been, they've been launching initiatives and then shutting them down since
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   time immemorial.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   Look at them all.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   Kill by Google.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.520]   I'd be concerned if they weren't killing things.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.920]   That's when I get scared for Google when there's nothing left to take.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.760]   I felt bad for, but you know, I understood that wasn't going, wasn't going anywhere.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.000]   Good technology.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.600]   Just I think it was just so ambitious.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.360]   They wanted to make their own like kind of console platform and I'd like, they should
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   have just sold it, sort of licensed the technology because that's, I mean, that's where it is.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.240]   Maybe they tried to and Squarespace didn't want it.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   I don't know.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   Probably.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   Right.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.000]   She's Squarespace only has so much money guys.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.880]   Can't believe they bought Google domains.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.360]   Like that was the best you could do.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.800]   I mean, look, nothing wrong with Squarespace, but they're, they're a web design, you know,
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.040]   website company.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.200]   Not an incident.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.840]   For years, I've said to people, do not get your domain from the same people who you do
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   as your, do your website.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.840]   Yeah, that's convenient, but it's a bad idea.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.560]   You should have, have it somewhere else like hover.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:08.640]   Well, and didn't, wasn't there a time where like you couldn't, which, and then maybe I'm
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   mixing up services.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.880]   There was a point where you couldn't buy, you couldn't import a domain to Squarespace.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.440]   Like you had to buy it through Squarespace.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.600]   Oh, maybe I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.200]   If you wanted to build a site, like it was like, if you wanted to use a domain, you had
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:25.640]   to do it through them, which means if you had already registered a website, forget it.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   Forget it.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   Like it just did it.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   Well, that was, I'm sure they changed that.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   That's a bad idea.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.160]   Or if they haven't already, now they can.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.320]   There is a larger question.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.520]   I mean, yes, of course, Google should kill stuff that doesn't make money or whatever.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.360]   Every company should do that.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.440]   But at some point, doesn't it hurt you?
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.040]   Like people are, you know, and then now Google comes up with some shiny new thing.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.840]   I'm going to be, I'm really going to think twice before I adopt anything Google comes
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   up with, right?
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.920]   Oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, nothing that they come up with.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   I mean, I don't think they follow through.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.560]   I mean, Gmail is like the only things I use and drive.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   It's like it.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.320]   But think about how Google really did well in the past.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.640]   They launched Google search, which was amazing.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   Very ad light.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   They made a bunch of money.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.440]   Enormous amounts of consumer surplus there.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.600]   Gmail came out, have a gigabyte of storage, change the way we think about the internet.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.600]   They made Chrome.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.280]   Here's a lightweight browser that's super fast.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.360]   And since then they have, in the should of five, to use Corey's language search, Gmail
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.120]   has a stock gauge of the point of being vetted.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.440]   And everything else they've done in this little kind of decade.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:34.960]   I mean, it's a company that appears to be more run by consultants than technologists.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.040]   And it answers to Wall Street more than users.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.920]   And I think that it just shows top to bottom.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.320]   It's disappointment.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.280]   But it's kind of, it really became big enough.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:51.200]   It's kind of a disease that's everywhere now endemic in the technology business.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.920]   It's just less, it's so much less about users and it's more about investors, right?
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.120]   It's just shareholders.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.120]   And that's it.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   Like, that's really the only thing.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.840]   So, like, there are a lot of companies feel like right now that, you know, over time,
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.320]   like last few years, especially, it just feels like there is such a devaluation of the
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.040]   user experience in favor of like just whatever boost shareholder income.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.600]   I mean, even in, and this is not even like exclusive detect.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.760]   This is like happening in Hollywood as well with the writer strike and everything that's
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.440]   going on there.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.840]   And you know, these really big corporations buying up studios and stuff and deciding that,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   you know, oh, well, we're going to issue creatives in favor of our shareholders.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.000]   And it's like, oh, we're just going to take a big tax right off on, you know, SpaceGhost
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.360]   was fully pulled off of Max this last week.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   Like, SpaceGhost, Coast to Coast, fully pulled off Max.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.960]   And it's like, because they don't want to pay royalties on it and they just want to
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.280]   take a big write off on it.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.720]   And so it's like, I assume that they say, okay, well, this is a show that like, you know,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.200]   probably not a ton of people rewatch, but also it's enough that, you know, just the
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:03.280]   cost of them keeping it online is enough that, you know, and it's an older show.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.760]   So probably the residuals are a little bit better.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.600]   And so it's like to keep that, you know, in place, it's like it didn't make sense for
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.560]   shareholders, but not for people who are using the service.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.880]   So it, that is a real bummer and it's just really prevalent right now.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.240]   It does feel like it's everywhere.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.360]   Here's, I think part of the reason why that's happening is because we're pretty far after
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.440]   the last technology generation shift.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.600]   That's why we're doing some new platform or a new major method of building stuff.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   New stuff comes out.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.200]   It really changes the game, makes a lot of money and it hasn't been so finally optimized
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.520]   for net income that there's a lot of consumer surplus left.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.920]   And then, you know, this far into the last cycle.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.040]   Watch as open AI speed runs the inshitification cycle.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   Yes.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.640]   They're going to go right through it.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.800]   Let me read you.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.520]   This is from Corey's post TikToks and shitification.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.280]   This is how platforms die.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.800]   First, they are good to their users.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:02.440]   Reddit, Google, then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   Finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value from themselves.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.840]   Then they die.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.400]   I call this perfect.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.760]   That's a pretty perfect life cycle.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.000]   That's a pretty perfect life cycle image.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.520]   He says, "I call this inshitification and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.360]   from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:36.640]   the nature of a two-sided market where a platform sits between buyers and sellers,"
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:42.440]   in the case of Reddit, readers and posters, "holding each hostage to the other, raking
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.360]   off an ever larger share of the value that passes between them."
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   Happened to TikTok.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   Happened to Twitter.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   It's happening at Reddit.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.400]   He uses Amazon as his classic sample.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.840]   Amazon is a great example.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   Great example.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.160]   When a platform starts, it needs users, so it makes itself valuable to users, often selling
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.160]   below cost.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   Think of Amazon.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.520]   For many years, it operated at a loss using its access to the capital markets to subsidize
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.480]   everything you bought.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.520]   They kept going back to raise more money.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.040]   When VC said no more money, they started borrowing.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.000]   It sold goods below cost and shipped them below cost.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.880]   It operated a clean and useful search.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.320]   If you search for a product, Amazon tried its damnedest to put it at the top of the
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.320]   search results.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.520]   That was a hell of a good deal for Amazon customers, Corey writes.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.480]   Lots of us piled in and lots of brick and mortar retailers withered and died, making it hard
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.000]   to go elsewhere.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.640]   But then that tempted in lots of business customers.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.680]   Marketplace sellers who turned Amazon into the everything-storted promise from the beginning.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.400]   Has these sellers piled in?
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.320]   Amazon shifted to subsidizing suppliers.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.920]   Can the inaudible creators got generous packages?
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.280]   Marketplace sellers reached huge audiences.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.120]   Amazon took low commissions for them, made it harder for shoppers to find anything anywhere
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   except Amazon.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.480]   But it also meant more sellers had to be on Amazon.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.800]   That's when Amazon started to harvest the surplus from its business customers and sent
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.120]   it to Amazon shareholders.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:17.360]   Today, marketplace sellers are handling or handing 45% of the sale price to Amazon in
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.360]   fees.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.720]   45%.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.520]   The company's $31 billion advertising program and put that in scare quotes is really a pay
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:31.240]   all scheme that pits sellers against each other.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.560]   Surplus is their first directed to users.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.160]   Then once they're locked in, surplus is go to suppliers.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.920]   Then once they're locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.840]   The platform becomes a useless pile of poop.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:47.720]   It's effectively the dentist system from It's Always Sunny, but for apps.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.960]   Tell me that because I don't watch that show.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.120]   It's always sunny in the fifth season.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.160]   There is this very classic famous episode called the dentist system.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.080]   I will watch this.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   It introduces this thing called the dentist system.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:08.880]   The dentist in It's Always Sunny, if you're not familiar with his character, is basically
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.680]   a sociopath.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.180]   Borderline psychopath.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.360]   There's a subreddit about it, I'm sure.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   The dentist system is his system to get women to sleep with him.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:29.360]   He's like, "The dentist system is D, demonstrate value, E, engage physically, and nurture dependence,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.960]   and neglect emotionally, then inspire hope, and then separate entirely."
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.240]   Every time I think about technology, it's always sunny in Philadelphia, literally,
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.640]   inspired this somehow.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.920]   I don't know how it happened, but the dentist system predicted our current situation.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.840]   Oh my God.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.880]   How many dentists have done?
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   I've been using that system for years.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.360]   I didn't even know there was a name.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.160]   Oh, it's the dentist system.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.160]   It's from 2009.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.640]   It's an episode that aired a long time.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   It's such a funny God that shows so funny.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.640]   But yes, it's a dentist system.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.640]   They just...
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   It's still good.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   How many seasons?
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   It's still good.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.960]   It's still good.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.200]   There are some still...
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:14.560]   They still manage to have at least one absolute banger episode every season that is just instant
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.560]   classic.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.080]   15 years they've been doing this.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.080]   It's amazing.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.080]   Long time.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.560]   And they've had how many seasons?
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.560]   16.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   16 seasons.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.560]   16 seasons.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.560]   I mean, it's just...
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.560]   And it's a timeless show.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.880]   That's the great thing about it.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   It's not a timeless show.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.120]   And watch because Max will kill it as soon as they're not making any money on it.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.120]   Why do we have to call it Max?
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.560]   Where does that affect sense up on Hulu?
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.760]   But is it Hulu about to be soon?
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   Well, Hulu is going to...
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:47.600]   Yeah, Hulu is going to be down now because Disney is like...
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.360]   I think it's Comcast is selling its last...
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.280]   They held like 10% and then they're finally letting that go on.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.520]   And then at that point, what?
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.080]   Disney Plus and Hulu become the same?
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.200]   They'll make one big app.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:05.400]   And I'm sure because the thing is like, so it doesn't suit them to really have two separate
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.440]   apps like that, especially now that they've implemented parental controls and R-rated
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.560]   content on Disney Plus, which for a while they didn't.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.560]   They were...
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.560]   They were...
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.640]   Separation of adults and kids content.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   Kids content.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   But now it's there.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.000]   They're like, "Well, now we have some adult content.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.360]   You have gates and parental controls and stuff.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.880]   So now we're just going to merge them."
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.880]   What would they call it?
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.120]   Since there's Macs, I should call it mini.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.120]   Mini.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.120]   Mini like mini mouse.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   With the mini ears.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   You should have the ears and the bow.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   It's like right there.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.280]   You can either subscribe to mini or Macs.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.280]   Or Macs.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   Which one?
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.360]   Get the one you like.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.360]   It's a bad...
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.160]   The streaming thing is another example of in shirtification, I think.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.160]   It's just...
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   It's a mess.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   It's a mess.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:56.840]   I think also the studio system in general is like a very complicated and specific thing.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:05.120]   It's a very specific business model that often does not work with people who are traditionally
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:15.000]   used to making money in non- regular VC and that startup space and Silicon Valley.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.920]   So now that all of these Silicon Valley technology executives are getting their hands into the
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.760]   studio system, it's kind of a mess.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.720]   It's like lifting up a rug and finding a disaster and being like, "Oh my God, this is really
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.720]   bad.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   How can we undo this?"
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.280]   It's just it's not...
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.640]   I don't know that anybody's right in it, but it's just like it definitely is like the
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.320]   studios have done it their way for a really long time and there's a very specific way
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.400]   that their finances are structured.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.080]   And this is like flies directly in the face.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   It's like indirect opposition of how traditional startups and corporations make money and report
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.080]   them on taxes and stuff.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:59.960]   So that's why you're now just seeing all of these tax write offs, stuff leaving services
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.040]   as a big tax write off that'll never get seen again and stuff.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:09.400]   It's because now they're having more traditional money and shareholder and investors get involved
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:16.040]   in the studio system and they're demanding that the returns be done "properly" which
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.760]   the studio system never really did it that way.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:28.520]   I was reading, there's a new Indiana Jones movie, The Last Indiana Jones because, well,
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:33.040]   I don't know, I'm sure they'll have more, but The Last One with Harrison Ford.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:39.840]   And I was reading a review and somebody in the review pointed me to the original Indiana
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.880]   Jones review in The New Yorker by Pauline Kale.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.040]   And it was very interesting.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   What was that?
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   Wouldn't that come out?
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.320]   It was 1989 Indiana Jones.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   That's the third one.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   No, that's the later one.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.840]   Yeah, that was the last crusade I think.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.240]   She said, oh, here it is, the temples of doom.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.160]   Because I think Temple of Doom was '83, I think it was the year.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.000]   The second one, that was the year I was born, '83.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.760]   So I think there was an Indiana Jones idea.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.720]   It was a very good year.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.560]   Is there a turn of the Jedi and Indiana Jones?
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.560]   So people are just like really hot on Harrison Ford.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.560]   There was the year of Harrison Ford in '83.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.440]   Is she not also here in Metallica, dropped and ride the lightning?
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.200]   Oh, maybe.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   Maybe.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   Pauline Kale in 1981.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.280]   '84, ride the lightning.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:34.240]   In 1981 wrote her review of the first Indiana Jones, the title is "Wipped."
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.680]   Love this.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.680]   And this is an '81, remember.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.800]   This is what 40 some years ago, 42 years ago.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.040]   The marketing executives of the new high priests of the movie business.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.040]   Wow.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:54.360]   Basically, she said, and this is 40 years ago, movies are now made because the marketing
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.120]   department says, yeah, we can sell that.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:04.800]   And she predicted that it would all be comic book movies, superhero movies, and horror
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.720]   movies basically.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   Comic strip pulp or sloppy horror, she said, is the future of the movie business.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.240]   She wasn't wrong.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   No.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.480]   Also, do you know how excellent that headline was for that article?
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.960]   Do you know how poorly that would have done an SEO term?
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.440]   What if we lost?
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.920]   Yeah, you could have a one word review as clever as it is.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920]   No.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   I try this all the time.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.280]   I try to make clever headlines.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.440]   And then my team just deletes them and says, you know, a couple of options that people
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   want to go online.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.680]   And to prove this, I was searching for this review and I came up with the later ones because
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   they had better SEO.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.040]   It took me a while to get the whipped.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.360]   So this has been going on forever, right?
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.000]   I just don't understand the staying power of it.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.080]   She was right that it became essentially comic books turned into films, but didn't we
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.560]   all lose interest like 10 years ago?
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.560]   There's a new flash movie.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.760]   And I know this because there's some controversy with someone, one person on the cast.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.320]   Well, also it's supposed to be a horrible movie.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   Have you seen it?
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   Really Leo?
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   The flash?
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   The 50th flash movie isn't good.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320]   I'm going away.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.800]   I thought it was going to be the new freaking Shakespeare.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.920]   I thought this was going to break new ground in the American zeitgeist.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.120]   So what it means to be alive?
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.120]   Of course it's crap.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.280]   It's the flash.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.760]   And you know how we know it's crap because variety says the flash disappoints with the
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.640]   $55 million debut.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.000]   That's how we know it's bad.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.480]   Could market that one, I guess.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:45.520]   If only somebody, a superhero could go back in time if these are superpowers change,
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.520]   change history.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.520]   It's been the world backwards maybe.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.520]   That might work.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.360]   I think a big part of it is, I mean, merchandising like doesn't, I mean, it's a big, it's just
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.640]   a big machine, right?
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.080]   It's like, you know, I think merchandising like doesn't, doesn't hurt, right?
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.760]   And it's like, and also there are new people discovering that stuff every day.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.720]   You're going to find this out, Alex.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.560]   One day your kid's going to be like, I like super kitties and you're like, what is that?
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.360]   And then you watch it and you're like, this is actually like pretty good.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360]   But also like now I have to buy you those toys.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.320]   Do you have to watch children's TV now, Ashley?
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:26.240]   I've watched so much children's TV that I feel qualified to say that so much of it is
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.080]   actually very good.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:34.240]   There's some really good kids TV out there.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.680]   And also, so there is some of it that is very clearly very bad.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:47.600]   And I'm sure the companies making those, the executives at the studios making those shows
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   would love nothing more than to ask Bart or Chad GBT to write those episodes because
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.440]   they just don't care.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.720]   Baby Shark could be written by any, any proficient AI in the world.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   Fortunately, my kid, like I am very like hashtag blessed.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.800]   My kid is not into that song and we never played.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.240]   He listens to regular music.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.880]   So it's like, yeah, I figure your kids be pretty hip.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.880]   He likes the Beastie boys.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.360]   He's like his favorite.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   He loves intergalactic.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.040]   That's his favorite song right now.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.520]   My third grade basketball team.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520]   That was our warm up song.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.520]   Wow.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.520]   That's a good one.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520]   Got me really into the beach song.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520]   That's a hype song.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520]   Totally a hype song.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520]   It's fantastic.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.880]   But I want to go back to the technology companies getting involved in the studio game and trying
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   to do some stuff.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.680]   Please, I would love to hear from you about this.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:39.080]   Amazing how the quality is so variable because do you remember when Amazon dropped their
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.320]   Lord of the Rings universe thing and the rings of power?
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.480]   And like I'm a lot of money on that, by the way.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.960]   Yeah, a lot of money.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   Yeah, a lot of money.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.440]   Basically, we really wanted a Game of Thrones bad.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.400]   And then I'm watching Apple TV plus Max's new show, Silo, which is based on a series
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.800]   of novels I have somewhere on the shelf over here.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.200]   And whoa, actually, right?
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200]   Whoa.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   Will.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   Will.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   We're interviewing the author of whoa on in our club.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Wait.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.000]   Alex is like, how do I get on this?
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   No, I'm joined.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   I'm joined.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   29.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   Discord.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   Hugh Howie.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Wow.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   June 29.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   You're in the club.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   In the club.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   I it's on one of my discord accounts.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   I got to show up to that.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Show is good.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.040]   And it barely follows the novels pretty closely, right?
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   It does.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.240]   And so there's an enormous quality gap that seems to play out in these tech companies
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.720]   trying to get into the media game.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.200]   But I think fundamentally they won't be good at it over a long period of time because
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.000]   art doesn't scale the way technology does.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   And I don't think the people who do accounting will ever actually understand that.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.200]   Actually, I wish I had a let me there's a cup.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200]   We're going to take a break.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200]   We have to.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:58.160]   We've got the fact that Google's entire financial model might be under threat by the EU.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.680]   Which is a good story.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.760]   But I what there were a couple of Pauline Kale quotes from this quipped review that
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.560]   I wanted to to read to you because I thought they were so I should have I should have marked
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.720]   them.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.160]   One is I think he said George Lucas.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.240]   He said George Lucas is basically a selling toys.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   That's really what his job is.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.680]   Oh, crud.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.080]   Oh, well, I saw it.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   There were some really awesome quotes in here.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:37.960]   Anyway, are you going to go see the new Indiana Jones and the worst name ever the dial of
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   death?
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.320]   You know, the dial of death or is it the dial of destiny?
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.320]   Dial of destiny.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.360]   It's a dial is all I know.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   A dial.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.160]   Yeah, I think I'd rather watch Nicholas Cage steal the Constitution again than watch another
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.280]   Indiana Jones movie that's literally spun up to try to do the nostalgia grift on my
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   game.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   I'll watch it.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   I'll watch it.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.280]   I love pulp.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.240]   So I love a good and pulp adventure and I also really love Phoebe Wallenbridge.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   So I'll totally watch it.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.560]   Oh, she's working on she's working on the new Tomb Raider too, which Amazon also now
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.760]   is like a got their hands.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.560]   Kale writes there's nothing at stake in Raiders.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.160]   No revelation, no surge of feeling at the end.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:19.840]   The thrills are fully consumed while you're seeing this movie and it's totally over when
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.840]   it's over.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.840]   It's a workout.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.280]   You feel as if you'd been to the desert digs at the end, your mind is blank, yet you're
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.920]   parched, you're puffing hard.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.000]   You want relief.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.480]   Look, man, I really love chicken big nuggets.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.880]   Oh, there you go.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.720]   They're not healthy for me.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.880]   They I don't I feel nothing as soon as the high of eating them wears off.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.560]   Like I don't I don't necessarily feel good about myself, but also I had a really good
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.760]   time while it was happening.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   And that's what matters.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760]   All right.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   I don't want to harsh your mellow though.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   You're absolutely right.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   Absolutely.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   Let me have my pulp Leo.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.280]   Let me have my pulp adventures.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   Your pulp.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.360]   We're going to take a break when we come back more with our fabulous panel and we are going
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360]   to talk gaming.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.600]   We had a very, very good discussion before the show and I kind of want to ask you about
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.520]   Diablo four where all three of us playing it and other games.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.080]   And I'm sure Alex, you have some sort of quirky world building game that you can't stop playing
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.880]   and you got me into you got me into what was it?
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.600]   Faithless frontiers endless frontiers fart farthest frontiers.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.920]   Actually, it's very I liked Age of Empires.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.440]   So it fits in with what you know, I like that style of gaming.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.200]   Hey, we'll talk about that a bit.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.680]   But first speaking of streaming, let's talk about Express VPN.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:38.280]   It is not uncommon these days to spend over $100 a month on streaming services.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   Look at your bill.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.600]   I bet you do Netflix and Disney plus and prime.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.840]   You can save a little bit by using Express VPN.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:54.720]   See, it turns out Netflix has as an example, many more shows than you've seen on the US
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   Netflix.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.480]   You don't see them because it depends on what country you're in.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.400]   So what you see on Netflix here, for instance, completely different to Netflix Italy or Netflix
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   South Korea.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.880]   Netflix is all over the place, Japan, England.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.200]   Well, this is one of many reasons you should use Express VPN.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.480]   It's easy to change your online location.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.160]   Express VPN has over 90 countries to choose from.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.960]   So if you've got some interesting tastes in TV, you just switched to another country.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.480]   You want to see South Korean Netflix?
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.320]   Believe me, it's got some great stuff there.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.480]   Are you like anime?
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.200]   Netflix, Japan.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.040]   It's heaven, baby.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:41.360]   Right now you can watch all of Downton Abbey on Canadian Netflix with Express VPN.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.440]   You just tap one button, change it to Canada, refresh the page.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.080]   Boom, there you are.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.960]   You don't have to pay extra.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.360]   Express VPN invests in the speed of its servers.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.920]   HD video, no problem.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.400]   You're not only put on your iPhone, your Android, your Mac, your PC, your Linux.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.560]   You can also put it on your router.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.520]   They sell some really good routers.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.480]   The routers, they sell are excellent quality or you could put it on some existing routers,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.080]   protect the whole house and I guarantee you, no one will complain.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.480]   They won't know because Express VPN doesn't slow you down.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.880]   They're also great for privacy because when you emerge on the public internet, you don't
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   emerge as yourself.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.040]   You emerge with an Express VPN IP address.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.520]   So people don't, you just don't have to worry about being tracked.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.560]   You're not going to be.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.440]   And of course for security, Express VPN is the best.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.800]   You can even get discounts on Express VPN.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.600]   If you buy Netflix in Argentina, it's less.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.760]   Express VPN less than seven bucks a month for the best VPN service out there.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.240]   Yes, your privacy is absolutely guaranteed Express VPN.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.800]   There was a great article on bleeping computer about how they run their servers.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800]   It was quite impressive.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800]   They go the extra mile.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.880]   Yes, of course, they don't do any logging.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.480]   They say that in their privacy policy, they're independently audited.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.800]   So we know that's true.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.960]   But listen to what they do to make sure that nothing will be preserved from your visit.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:06.480]   They run a special custom Debian distro on all their servers that wipes the drive every
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.000]   time they reboot every day wipes the drive.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.240]   Nothing's left.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.480]   Plus when you spin up your Express VPN server, it's technology they wrote called trusted
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.560]   server runs in RAM sandbox can't write to the hard drive.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.960]   The minute you close it, it disappears.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.160]   And so does every trace of your visit.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.760]   It's the little things like that that makes such a difference to me.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.040]   It's why I use Express VPN.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.040]   It's no brainer.

[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:55.480]   It's the only VPN I recommend and use Express VPN dot com slash twit.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.680]   Uh, Google, I don't know if this is trouble for Google or not.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:06.000]   The EU is getting more and more aggressive with American big tech companies.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.480]   Now the EU says Google's online advertising practices violate antitrust laws.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.240]   They filed new charges against Google.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.200]   And remember the EU can charge huge fines.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.520]   I think it's up to 4% of global revenues.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.280]   The case was brought by the European Commission.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:31.000]   It's the fourth time Google's been charged with violating antitrust and has in the past
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.320]   cost them significant amounts of money.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.600]   They were accused of abusing monopoly over their online technology back in January.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.760]   Britain's antitrust by the US Department of Justice.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.120]   Britain's antitrust authorities also been investigating their advertising practices.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.080]   Most of Google's revenue, almost all of it surprisingly does not come from Google domains.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   It comes from.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.240]   Wow, I'm shocked.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   Shocking.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240]   What comes?
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.320]   It comes from advertising.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.440]   Uh, Margaret Vistiger, the executive vice president of the European Commission said Google
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.000]   is present at almost all levels of the so-called ad tech supply chain.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.120]   Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favor its
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.600]   own intermediation services.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.360]   They both buy and sell.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:29.440]   They have both sides of the transaction, which is, yeah, I think that's probably kind of
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.560]   not okay.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.200]   But it's how they do business.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.480]   Alex, what's the remedy?
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.360]   Is Google have to sell off double click?
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.480]   So I pulled up the European Union statement on this.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.240]   And I just found this to be really funny.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   It's about remedies.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   So hear me out.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.120]   The Commission preliminary finds that in this case, a behavioral remedy is likely to be
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.240]   ineffective to prevent the risk that Google continues to such self-preferencing, conduct
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.600]   or engages in new ones.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.800]   So that limits what they can do to some pretty harsh things.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:11.120]   If they do find Google to actually be in finishing article 102 of the treaty on the functioning
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.520]   of the European Union.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.800]   Typically, when this kind of thing happens with a DOJ, the FTC, the EU, a company will
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.640]   say, "All right, all right, let's make a deal.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.320]   I will do this or that.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.760]   I'll sell off Instagram or I will give discount."
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.400]   They try to find a way out of it.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:35.080]   Microsoft famously said, "We'll make a deal with the PlayStation that for 10 years we
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.760]   won't do an exclusive on Call of Duty," that kind of thing.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.560]   Those are the behavioral remedies.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.000]   They're saying they won't accept that?
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.320]   They're saying it probably won't work because Google won't actually stop being bad.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   Well, that's pretty true.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.920]   I got to say, yeah.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:54.280]   I mean, it's funny to see it so bluntly put in kind of like diplomatic speak, if you will.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:59.800]   But I reread their complaints and it seems a little bit cut and try.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.920]   I know Google has a different opinion about this and a lot of people that I know work
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.960]   there, so I hope they're okay.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.240]   But the EU is an enormous economic block and can throw around its weight and Google cannot
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.800]   afford to not operate there because that would put an enormous chunk of the global GDP outside
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   of its reach.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.600]   So, I don't know where this is going to go.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.800]   Obviously, Google will fight this with an entire army of lawyers and lobbyists.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.840]   So it's far from guaranteed.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.880]   But Leo, could we be working towards an environment in which Google gets forced to break up?
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.280]   I think that's...
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.000]   Is that what they're talking about?
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.600]   So I mean, I don't see another way around it.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   It takes a while.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:42.920]   So Google has been fined billions of dollars by the EU, all of which currently being appealed.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:48.280]   So they haven't played a penny yet, including Android antitrust.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.880]   Remember the shopping service antitrust?
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:58.280]   They've been a number of fines levied, all of which are held up by appeal.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:03.200]   Probably.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.360]   It's shocking to me because it took this long almost to get here.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.320]   Isn't these technology companies are doing stuff that's brand new to their business model?
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.800]   In fact, the EU statement says, "Since at least 2014, Google has been doing these things
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   we don't agree with."
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.760]   I'm like, "Cool, that is a decade ago."
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:27.480]   And part of the Coinbase SEC frockness right now is because Coinbase is occupying a greater
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:31.160]   number of places in the kind of trading stack, if you will.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.000]   And Coinbase is like, "Well, we've always done that."
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.400]   And the SEC said, "Well, that doesn't mean it was okay.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.000]   It just means we're now tapping your risk for it."
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.400]   Yeah, Coinbase's defense was, "Well, what did the government said?
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.040]   Well, you can pay taxes on that, right?"
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.200]   Or something like that.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.360]   And they said, "Well, doesn't that mean what we're doing is legal?"
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.080]   No, it just means you can pay taxes on it.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.680]   You can always pay taxes on things, but this means that the government is...
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.080]   It's not as a level of approval.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.080]   Yes.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:04.280]   It's interesting to see regulation catch up with certain business models that I've worked
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.960]   in the technology space that I've been incredibly lucrative over a long period of time.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.560]   And then tech people are acting all surprised with both hands in the cookie jar that they
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.320]   control both of.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.400]   In this case, I think we all kind of agree that Google might be slightly more powerful
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.120]   in the online advertising world than is good for the internet.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:30.240]   It's killing us between Google and Spotify and Facebook and Amazon and Microsoft.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.040]   Podcast ads are dwindling rapidly.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.040]   Oh, I know.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.760]   My podcast is currently unsponsored, so...
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.760]   Yeah, that sucks.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   It makes me sad.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.640]   I'm like, "I hate doing ads because I'm not good at them like Leo is, but when I don't
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.840]   have one, I'm like, "Oh, well, you know you're doing something to come."
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.560]   You're the Google domains of tech crunch is what you're saying.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.600]   No, I'm not being so full of several...
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.600]   Over nine figures.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.520]   I'm just currently sucking resources down for production and...
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   It's a record.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.960]   I can in fact be sold for nine figures.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.960]   Oh, me too.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960]   Why don't you know what's out there?
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960]   Me too.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.960]   Nine figures?
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   That seems...
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   Yeah, that seems alright.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:09.960]   Spotify.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.960]   I'll go on Joe Rogan.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.680]   And to me, actually Spotify, if you want me to say COVID's good vaccine's bad, I'll be
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.680]   glad to.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.000]   Just give me a hundred million.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   It's no problem.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   No problem.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   So easy.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.680]   I'm not going to buy seven figures right there.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.680]   I know.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680]   It's right there.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.840]   Dropping from eight to seven.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.480]   It'll be fine.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:33.880]   On the antitrust thing though, I do think there will come a time in the next half to
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.400]   full decade in which we have to take a pretty hard look at some of these major tech companies
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.800]   and say enough.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.360]   I was pretty opposed to the Activision Blizzard Microsoft deal because...
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   Are you?
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   Yes.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   Why?
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360]   Because of course it's anti-competitive.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.640]   They're not spending that amount of money to not generate some sort of edge.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   Right.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   They're not buying it altruistically.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.960]   They're not buying it for fun.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.960]   They're not buying it just because it's a long-term.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.600]   Are you saying it's a profit deal?
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   I'm trying to say Leo that a company that has lived as long as Microsoft has and has
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.840]   created trillions of dollars in value knows how to make money.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:08.720]   And I don't think we should allow them to purchase major assets that could give it increased
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   market leverage.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.200]   Well, it looks like it's down to you in the UK.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.200]   We'll see.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.200]   We'll see.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.200]   It's down to me, Lena Kahn in the UK.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.920]   Actually, the FTC is moving ahead, aren't they?
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.800]   It's a news item in that particular saga.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.880]   But Google is enormously powerful.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.280]   I didn't get in larger.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.280]   Microsoft is the same.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.840]   Apple to a similar degree.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.080]   Meta is kind of taking care of itself, if you will, which is interesting.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:36.040]   Well, that's one of the arguments is that won't these companies all in the end suffer,
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.240]   you know, nothing succeeds forever.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.560]   They're not going to grow infinitely.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.760]   At some point, times will change and there'll be another company to come along.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   Right?
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   Maybe.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:53.000]   That might be the case, but it doesn't actually mean that the harm during the period of incumbency
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.280]   isn't real just because it'll eventually end.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:01.000]   I don't think eventual death is enough to say that a crime is not worth noting along
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.040]   the way to make an analogy if you will.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.320]   So I think we're going to have to decide as an American society.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.320]   I mean, just sort of the EU is involved in this case, but I think here in the States,
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.800]   because the biggest technology companies that are active around the world really are
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   American, right?
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.560]   Chinese companies tend to be limited to that geography to a large degree.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.200]   And so we're going to have to make a decision about how we treat these companies.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.600]   Do they get to be nation states that are essentially beholden to nobody but themselves?
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.760]   Or should we make them smaller and more competitive?
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.200]   I mean, I'm a capitalist, but I really think the latter makes more sense than letting them
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.600]   grow forever.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.600]   Sorry.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:44.400]   No, I, you know, I don't, I just feel like this is a really tough one.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.000]   Because there's so much benefit.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.720]   Well, let's talk about Apple's Vision Pro.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.960]   No garage entrepreneur could have created that.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:02.520]   It took a company willing to sink tens of billions of dollars, thousands of man hours,
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:08.560]   a man power, you know, humans into a product that nobody apparently wants to buy at this
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.560]   point.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.200]   You know, it's a big, it's a big risk, but only a big company like me.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.360]   I know me and Alex are like, we want to buy it.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:19.000]   I'm pitching the wife already to allocate budget for my 35 years.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.560]   We've already agreed.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.480]   We have a, we've literally have already agreed to, to a splitting of the, of an AVP.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.880]   We're going to, I want it.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.360]   I want, well, look, this is as close as I'm getting right now, Leo, like this is.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   That's pretty good.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   What I said.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   Did you steal that from the staff?
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.680]   Punk guys, did you break their?
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680]   I did.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.800]   It's just a sun visor that I wear by the pool.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.800]   This is all I have.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.600]   Do you really wear that?
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.520]   Hell yeah, it's great.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.920]   I don't have any, I don't get any nose bumps.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.560]   You have a giant, like white swan across your face.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.600]   That's a don't, that's called a don't talk to me screen.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.120]   That's called a don't talk to me.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   Don't persevere.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.120]   She might be an alien.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120]   Leave me alone.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.960]   I want to be by the pool without discussion.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.800]   It is a mirrored shade that is the size that goes from her forehead to the bottom of
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.800]   her nose.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.920]   It's a, it's effectively, it's a motorcycle visor.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.960]   It's the front of a visor and sin, but it's just that.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.480]   And then it has a soft thing on it.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:13.480]   No helmet.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   No helmet.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.480]   No helmet.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.480]   But to leave it's point.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   But, but only it's a lot of money to make the vision put.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.920]   Yeah, only you, only Apple could do that.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.120]   Nobody's going to, you know, I mean, admittedly, Palmer lucky that a kick started to create
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.200]   the Oculus Rift, but there is a big gulf between the Oculus Rift and the Vision Pro.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.360]   Right.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:36.080]   But, but at the end of the day, I mean, I think that it's, there will always be those scenarios
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:42.440]   and that, that shouldn't mean that they, that these corporations get to suck all the oxygen
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.280]   out of the room and snap up.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.800]   You know, I look at Facebook as a really good example of like, I think of all of the startups
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.880]   that Facebook has eaten because it felt threatened or, or just copied, like just straight up
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:01.520]   stole their homework and copied directly from and put other companies out of business.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:08.800]   And it's just like, none of those companies are, are being given a chance unless they
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:16.320]   have a CEO who is very like specifically opposed to being acquired.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:23.440]   And even then it takes a tremendous and skilled, you know, to a series of events that have
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.360]   to happen in order for them to even get not even like close to, but, but just get any kind
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:37.800]   of success when you're fighting against companies like, you know, the, the former Fang companies.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:43.480]   I also want to say that you don't have to start with the Apple Vision Pro, right?
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.160]   You could make something that was simpler and build a company and make more events hard
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160]   where as you go.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.080]   So I think Apple certainly coming out of the gate was something that makes me as, as a,
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:59.160]   as a technology nerd, as a fan of gadgets and someone who bought the original zoom, you
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.480]   know, like I like to buy stuff.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.480]   Let's go.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.800]   And I'm totally here for it.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:07.280]   But I don't think we would end up in a world in which that stuff isn't possible if we had
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.000]   technology companies that were smaller.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.440]   In fact, I would say it's more likely to have more likely because there, there's more internal
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.040]   competition at these companies.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.120]   And I think it would make for better companies to smaller ones instead of one vision pro.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:23.560]   You might get 10 unique takes on this category or something like that.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.760]   Because I mean, it's, it's why plays for sure beat iPod.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.200]   And if you don't get that joke and why it's sarcastic, well, congratulations on not being
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.000]   a nerd back in the day.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.520]   The phones were like this too, right?
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.240]   Like we very, for a really long time, we didn't see any variation in phones like self.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.720]   And we had a lot at the beginning.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.400]   And we're not seeing any at all.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.640]   We heard a different and now there's, it's like is a slab.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.640]   That's it.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:51.240]   And like we now we sort of have for the full, we have the, the folding, folding phone, which
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.960]   is an interesting new category.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.200]   But you know, I think that there's just, you know, those, those smaller companies who might
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.120]   have been willing to take a risk or be, have the ability to do such a thing.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.760]   Like there, those just aren't really around anymore.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.960]   Like it's not, what if Google just disappeared from the face of the earth tomorrow?
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.680]   We'd not be so weird.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.680]   Would we be okay?
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.920]   I'd be really mad about my Gmail account.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.760]   Well, the entire technology world runs on G Suite, right?
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.920]   So Google Cloud is an enormous business now.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.440]   It powers a big chunk of the internet.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.240]   It's kind of like if we deleted AWS, we would not be okay.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:34.280]   If I lost the ability to, to have a terrible consumer shopping experience on Amazon, I
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.280]   would be fine.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:37.320]   But I do worry about the info that he's going to run.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.040]   What if I said, what if I said, okay, in a week, Google's going to disappear quick,
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:48.360]   move Gmail to whatever outlook, move your cloud to Azure or AWS.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360]   You know, if I gave you some time.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:56.760]   Those other competitors have, have the infrastructure to support a massive chunk of the internet
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.920]   to come to them in a week.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:24:59.920]   Like I don't know.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.720]   But I mean, at least I mentioned the other argument.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:08.280]   I would say that what we need to have is more public clouds versus just one or two or
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.280]   three.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.640]   Like, yes, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud are fantastic for what they do.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.000]   But wouldn't it be cool if they're five versus three?
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.240]   So Amazon used to cut prices on AWS, like all the time, and it was awesome.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.720]   And then they got a bunch of competition and then it became the sole driver of operating
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.720]   and coming to Amazon.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.720]   So now they don't.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.920]   In some ways, the solution to certification is competition.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.920]   Yes.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.600]   So that, okay.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.600]   So if your company's decided to prioritize making money over your interests, then go to
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.800]   an equivalent, another one, an equivalent company.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   You're not stuck.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.800]   Exactly.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   But right now we don't have that.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.000]   We're in a place where there isn't an alternative.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.360]   And we're just trapped in these ecosystems where like Twitter is a really good example.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:26:00.160]   I think a lot of people in my timeline wish there was an alternative that was, you know,
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.520]   even half of what, you know, off what they get, what they used to get on Twitter.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.800]   Like they want out, but there is no real alternative.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.360]   And it's very similar with a lot of older people who still use Facebook.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:17.160]   It's like, you know, it's just like what's the alternative for them when they get so much
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.440]   of their life updates and group invites and, you know, all of that stuff.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.480]   Like they get all that stuff from that ecosystem.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.480]   And it's like very hard to break people out of an ecosystem when they're, when they are
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:34.160]   so reliant on it that it becomes a massive part of their, you know, user experience when
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.520]   they, when they pick up their phone.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.040]   Hmm.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:42.600]   I think also just having two OS's for her phones are not is not not enough.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.840]   And I think that tying one of them to the largest ad stack on the internet, it's not
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   so great either.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   Just my personal opinion.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.880]   So I think I think if we applied a bit of quarry to a bit of this world, it would be
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   okay.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.640]   But to be clear, we're not going to do this, right?
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:59.520]   It would require a shift in Congress and a shift in how we approach antitrust regulation
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.560]   and a change in the power between the American government and these companies.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.240]   Currently, the only thing much that's not allowed to do is buy the makers of Starcraft.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.160]   They've already bought a lot of other stuff.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.720]   So my argument here is certainly on the losing side and I'm not trying to.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.640]   Starcraft, that's the game you're going to focus on.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.640]   Well, you know what I don't play is Call of Duty because I didn't drink a lot of bush
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   light in college.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:29.560]   So I'm telling Paul, through you said that Paul doesn't like me already.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.680]   Paul actually, believe it or not, just went through a withdrawal three months withdrawal.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.840]   They stopped playing call for Call of Duty to like, we're going to say Bush life.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.400]   Well, might have gone along with the Bush light.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.400]   I don't know.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.400]   Maybe I'll have to ask you.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.400]   Maybe you may be telling them.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.680]   Maybe they might be playing in hand.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:52.600]   The reason why I picked Starcraft is Blizzard to me is Warcraft three and Starcraft.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.600]   No, you're right.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.920]   And the other game that we talked about before the show, but Starcraft and Starcraft too,
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.840]   will always have a special place in my, in my heart.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.840]   And I will go down on that ship.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.360]   Before we talk about any, any Blizzard activator, so I have, I have a, I have a duty to alert
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.960]   people that my husband works for Activision and my brother works at Blizzard.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:11.960]   Wow.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   It's all in the family.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960]   I can't, I cannot comment.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.440]   I don't like, I mean, I've talked about it on, on Twitter.
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.600]   So like I don't, I don't have any official comments.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.600]   What does he do with Activision?
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.600]   Is he a designer?
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.600]   Is he a lawyer?
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.600]   What is he?
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.040]   No, he's a, he does logistics for all of their esports.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040]   So he does.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:35.360]   He makes sure that all of the, basically like my husband is one of the linchpins that ensures
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:42.080]   all items, products, jerseys, computers, webcam, like literally all equipment gets to its destination
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.960]   and, and the events happen the way they're supposed to.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.800]   So what's the prognosis for esports?
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.920]   Cause I've thought for a long time that's the next big thing.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.480]   And then all of a sudden it seems to be collapsing in on itself.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480]   Esports is really hard.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.720]   I think, I think a lot of people saw what was happening in South Korea and really got
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:06.080]   excited in, in, you know, a Starcraft and, you know, legal legends and a lot of that
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:11.920]   in South Korea is just, you know, there's a very different, there's a very different
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:18.840]   culture around esports and, you know, for me, like kind of non exclusive to what's
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.440]   Activision or Blizzard, just esports in general.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:27.200]   I think one of the hardest things is that, you know, we don't really have, um, I've always
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:35.040]   wondered why we don't have home teams that have like arenas, like that, we don't have
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.080]   a place for fans to go to.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080]   It's always like, oh, they're going to play like in LA.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.800]   It's like, oh, they'll play at, you know, Microsoft Theater or they'll play here or whatever.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:48.360]   But it's like there, there should be like a location that is the team's stadium, as
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.520]   it were, it doesn't have to be huge.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:55.400]   And that's the place where fans can come for signings and they can come for, you know,
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:00.240]   press events and they can sell merch there and they can meet the players and like learn
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240]   about them more.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:06.040]   And one of the things we have in other sports that we, you know, that are very niche in
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:11.880]   esports, I think to a degree is superstars that are known outside of the sport itself.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:17.720]   So it's like a lot of people know a lot of football NFL players, even though they never
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.880]   have watched a football game.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.400]   Like, oh, I've seen Michael Strangan on live with Kelly and Michael.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   It's like, they're celebrities.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:30.800]   And the thing is, I think that there's a real difficulty in one, a lot of these kids are
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.800]   kids.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:37.040]   They're 18 and they are, you know, they're not great at talking on camera.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.520]   They're not good at reading a teleprompter.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.080]   They're not good at being a spokesperson.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.120]   They're just used to being at their desk and streaming and they're really good at it.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.760]   Like they're really good at it.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:52.160]   But that doesn't necessarily translate to a successful career as a, as a, as a celebrity
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:54.360]   or a personality, a bigger personality.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:58.840]   And I think really they, there's a, there's kind of a disconnect there between like, you
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:02.840]   have to kind of create a superstar in some ways, but also it's that lightning in a bottle
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   where you have to find the right person.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.080]   So I don't know that they've really found that formula yet.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.160]   And, and also you have to really, the most successful esports teams have super dedicated
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.440]   fan bases locally.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:20.500]   If you look at like Houston Outlaws for Overwatch, like they have a massively dedicated fan
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.500]   base.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:22.500]   They love them.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.500]   They love that team.
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.920]   Well, like their fans are crazy about the team.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.920]   They follow them.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:30.840]   It's, it's all the same things you see in other professional sports leagues.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.640]   But the thing is, it's like it doesn't happen with every team.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.080]   What is, so what's it going to take?
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.000]   How do we, how do we fix that?
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   I suppose it's three.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.180]   I suppose it is a, a, a maturing process where you get the esports athletes to become
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.920]   more camera ready.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.640]   You know, maybe they hired a rowdy skeleton, but they get them more.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.640]   Yes.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:58.260]   You know, I look at, uh, Alex and I are Formula One fanatics.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:02.500]   What turned that on around in the US was, uh, the Netflix show, a drive to survive.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.500]   Just survive.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.500]   Great show.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.500]   Amazing.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.500]   It's just loaded F1 in the US.
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.500]   Yep.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:13.900]   Uh, and I don't know if it's intentional or not, but F1 seems to choose its drivers, not
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.340]   just for their ability to drive.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.740]   Clearly they've got to have that, but because, but they're all damn fine looking people with,
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.580]   with pretty good personas on camera, right?
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:23.580]   Right.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.580]   Right.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.580]   Well, you pick the people who are interesting, right?
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:28.400]   It's, it's the same model as real housewives.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:34.680]   It, I mean, it literally is, which is like you're following a group of people who are
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.560]   forced to interact with each other over a season.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.160]   And there's like, act, there's an air of competitiveness to it.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.160]   Do we need that?
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:46.520]   Do we need a reality show based on an esports team to, hi, so, uh, this is Benito, by the
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520]   way, Benito, our, our guest director.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   Oh my God, Benito, we're just director.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   I was an esports journalist for like three years and I, I ran the East.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.520]   I'll ask Benito.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.000]   I ran all the esports coverage at GameSpot for a couple of years.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.100]   So the problem with esports is the stigma attached to it in America.
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.100]   That's really it.
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:01.100]   They're nerdy.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.100]   At the time.
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.100]   Yeah, that's a big one too.
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.500]   That's when esports was, when I was covering, esports was about to take off was like starting
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.500]   to do it take off.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.740]   I was trying to be like, I'm the vanguard of that.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:14.220]   And what I noticed is that people are really willing to drop a lot of money if there's
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:18.040]   only, only if there's a promise of a lot of money and like, well, yeah, that's exactly
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.660]   what happened in the esports business.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.820]   People dropped a ton of,
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.160]   look at this guy, this guy's toast who created an esports team.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.520]   He says it cost me a million dollars.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.960]   It's a terrible business.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.860]   Everyone's losing a lot of money.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:38.400]   He created a team for Valorant Pro called DSG and lost just a ton of money.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:41.400]   But it's like, who's talking about Valorant?
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:44.440]   Like, I generally have these questions.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.600]   It's just like, I don't, I don't know anybody.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.800]   I know people who play Valorant and it's a, it's a perfectly fine game.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:55.980]   But I don't know anybody who's like so hype about it that it's their entire personality.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:34:01.060]   The way that I literally know people whose entire personality is a football team.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:02.060]   Also, I matter.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:06.980]   I'm enjoying watching Alex because he doesn't realize he's muted his mic.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:11.260]   So he, he hasn't been able to get a word to edgewise on this whole thing.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.640]   And he is, he is champing at the bit.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.420]   If I might use a phrase from an older sport.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:19.980]   Yes.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:20.980]   What's your thoughts on?
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.900]   Does it do to to fan?
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.500]   No, no, actually not at all.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.620]   I've said this before, I think on Twitter, but like when I was a child, I used to drive
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.340]   my parents office because they had faster internet.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:37.340]   So I could watch Korean language, vods of brood war games that were uploaded to YouTube
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:38.900]   because there wasn't Twitch at that time.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:43.020]   So I'm a, I'm a, I am politely any sports OG in the sense that I've really cared about
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   it for a long time.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.420]   I think the problem was there was a period of rapid growth with things like the League
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.060]   of Legends Pro scene and then people got a little bit out of themselves on the revenue
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.820]   potential, put more money into the Nicki Sustain.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.540]   And now we are dealing with a pretty standard business hangover.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.540]   Is that true?
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:34:59.540]   But you know, would you say that's, that's fair.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.940]   I'd say that's 100% accurate.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.180]   Post the same as the pandemic.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:06.020]   Same as companies saying this is the new normal.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.780]   This is a new baseline and it wasn't, it wasn't at all.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.780]   It was just a, it was an anomaly.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:15.620]   And yeah, people, people over invested and yeah, it was just over and played it.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.300]   Historically, that seems to always happen.
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:23.320]   I think back to the railroad boom when we had a, when they finally built a cross country
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.880]   railroad in the United States, all the railroads of that time went bankrupt.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.220]   But what we got out of it was the infrastructure.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:35.060]   So a whole new generation of railroads could emerge.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.780]   And the same thing they say happened in the tech bust at the end of the last century.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:46.100]   There was an overbuild of fiber because everybody was so bullish in the late nineties that.com
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.220]   was going to rule the world.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.900]   There was the dot com bust, but we still have all of that fiber.
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.900]   And so I think that's a normal business cycle.
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.460]   Alex, you kind of follow the business cycle.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.460]   I think that's.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:03.140]   I think that's true in a lot of, a lot of cases when we're talking about physical infrastructure,
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:07.620]   like there was a canal building boom in, in Britain back in the day, right?
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:09.700]   The difference with the esports though is it's pretty digital.
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:10.700]   And so there's less of an asset.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.180]   There's no infrastructure at all.
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:17.580]   I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm talking about arenas doing physical things, but it's not quite the
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.620]   same, the same substance.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:23.500]   I think also it's just, it's too advertising driven a product right now, even though the
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.860]   day managed to bring in blue chip sponsors, like if you watch League of Legends, Pro scene,
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.660]   you'll see Visa logos and other big names.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.180]   And that's great and shout out to them.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:35.380]   But it's not going to be growing as much as people thought it might a couple of years
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:36.380]   ago.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:39.300]   And so people are dealing with the pain of over investment.
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:45.820]   But at the same time, compared to what there was when I was 15, 14, like the modern esports
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:47.340]   scene is so incredible.
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:51.340]   So sure, it's not going to take over the NFL or the NHL the next couple of years, but
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:57.340]   there's still so much going on that me, someone who never thought this would happen because
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.620]   no one else cared when I was a kiddo.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.100]   Modern people that are fans have so much more.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.300]   I'm just excited about that.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.900]   So to me, I'm measuring from the bottom up, yeah, from the top down on this thing about
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:12.420]   Dungeons and Dragons, which for a very long time was considered incredibly uncool, the
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.260]   foundation, but the foundations were there.
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:21.220]   And then it just took a few big hits like critical role and stranger things to bring

[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:24.980]   and then it will become available to apply as a skin to your character.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:27.980]   Then you can also dye everything and make it match, which is really nice.
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:32.980]   Oh, that's why you're collecting all those strange herbs.
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:37.980]   If you, of course, got to get my death mallow or whatever that's out there.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.980]   No, I got to make elixirs with that stuff.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:41.980]   You do all your upgrades and everything.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:42.980]   It's really nice.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:43.980]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:48.980]   If you want to kill not just a couple of like, you know, devil imps or large cows,
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:51.980]   you want to kill thousands of them mindlessly.
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:52.980]   It's amazing.
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:56.980]   If that's not your jam, it's not your jam, but like it's well done.
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:59.980]   I'm very happy that D4 seems to be as good as D3.
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:01.980]   Yeah, solid.
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:02.980]   I wish I could show you.
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:03.980]   There's a whole sub.
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:06.980]   There's a whole sub community within the Diablo 4 community dedicated to like,
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:11.980]   fashion Diablo, like it's just people like showing their, their steez.
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:12.980]   The drip is strong.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:13.980]   Like it's really good.
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:14.980]   I'm so here for it.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:17.980]   I wish I could show you how ugly my druid is.
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:22.980]   It is, it is, there's no fashion here at all.
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:24.980]   It's just the ugliest thing you've ever seen.
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:26.980]   Leo, I'm going to tweet.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:28.980]   I'm going to tweet right at you.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:31.980]   I will, I will take a screenshot and tweet it back.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:34.980]   All right, I would take a screenshot of mine and I'll send it over.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:35.980]   Okay.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:36.980]   I think I look cool.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:37.980]   I have a red, I have a red necromancer costume.
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:39.980]   I have a fat druid.
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:41.980]   He's really fat.
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.980]   And he's wearing like, for some reason antlers and, and he's got the ugliest,
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:49.980]   like he's got a skirt on.
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:51.980]   It's just, it's horrific.
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:53.980]   And, and there's nothing I could do about it.
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.980]   So I'm just going to stay.
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:57.980]   Like, you're just out there living your life in nature.
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:00.980]   I'm out there living my life in nature.
[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:01.980]   Exactly.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.980]   Exactly.
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:08.980]   Speaking of games, speaking of Whoopi Goldberg, Whoopi, there is a way to play the
[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:10.980]   Ablo 4 on the Mac.
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:15.980]   Apples kind of let this out at World Wide Developer Conference.
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:18.980]   And a few people picked up on it.
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:20.980]   Christina Warren's article here in Inverse.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:21.980]   Thank you, Christina.
[01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:23.980]   I didn't know she was still writing.
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:24.980]   She's now at the GitHub.
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.980]   She's on the show last week.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.980]   Didn't mention.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:34.980]   And she was going to write this long article about Apple releasing update to
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:40.980]   wine that lets you run direct X-12 games on Apple Silicon computers.
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:45.980]   It's a 20,000 line code patch for wine.
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:47.980]   But it works.
[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:53.980]   And ostensibly Apple says, well, that it's not to play Diablo 4 on the Mac.
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:59.980]   It's just to see if Diablo 4 works well and it would be portable to the Mac.
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:04.980]   But as it turns out, a lot of people are using it to run.
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.980]   Well, here's an example.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:09.980]   Diablo 4 running at 60 frames.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.980]   Good for them.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:12.980]   Yes.
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:17.980]   On an M2 Mac's computer.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:19.980]   So you can't absolutely do it.
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:21.980]   This is at Ultra.
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:26.980]   And so whoopee, just you know, you might want to check this out.
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:29.980]   I don't know how your hacking skills are these days.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:30.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:31.980]   But you could do it.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.980]   Was I stupid to do it at Druid?
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:35.980]   Should I have done a Necromancer?
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:36.980]   No.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:37.980]   You're both Necromancer.
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.980]   There must be something about it.
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:40.980]   I like having a skeleton on Teraj.
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:43.980]   That's just, that's how I always, I like to have an entourage.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.980]   I was a witch doctor in T3 and I had a bunch of minions.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:47.980]   Yeah, minions.
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:48.980]   I don't know.
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:50.980]   Do druids get minions?
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.980]   I think you, do you get wolves?
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:52.980]   We get one minion.
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:53.980]   Is there something I like there?
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.980]   We might get a bear with it.
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.980]   I think you can turn into a bear, which is really fun.
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:58.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:00:59.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:00.980]   That's exciting.
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:01.980]   That seems cool.
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:04.980]   I would, I rolled a barbarian and named her Barbie, but I haven't.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:08.980]   I think that when Diablo 3, I was playing as a barbarian most of the time.
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:09.980]   Cause I like that.
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:10.980]   That was a fun class in T3.
[02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:12.980]   That was fun class in T3 a lot.
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:13.980]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.980]   Well, I play a wizard.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:17.980]   So.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:18.980]   Oh, you're a wizard on a Necromancer.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:19.980]   Well, it's kind of the same.
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:24.860]   No, no, no, no, I was going to say this is all topic, but in Baldur's Gate 3, I play as
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:27.980]   a wizard, but I just change it up and be a Necromancer.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:28.980]   Yeah.
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:29.980]   Evil wizard.
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:30.980]   Boom wizard.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:31.980]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:37.180]   Oh, I'd rather talk about gaming than the rest of this, but all right.
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:40.700]   I guess we have to change the subject.
[02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:43.260]   Anything you want to say, Benita, before we move on?
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:46.060]   No, my taste about Diablo 4, 2 Spicy for the internet.
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:47.420]   Oh, you don't like Diablo.
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:48.420]   Oh.
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:49.940]   Oh, tell us now.
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:53.340]   No, I've just, I've, I've divorced myself from all Skinner boxes.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:55.540]   So it is a Skinner box.
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:58.420]   You press, you press the button, you get a little bird food.
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:00.300]   Yeah, I don't play loot games anymore.
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:02.620]   It is an absolutely, that's all it is is a loot game.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:03.860]   You play Dwarf Fortress.
[02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:04.860]   What is that?
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.860]   What do you call that?
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:06.860]   That's a deep simulation.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:07.860]   Deep, steep.
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:08.860]   No, it's not.
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:09.860]   It's a simulation.
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:13.540]   Well, you probably like farthest frontier.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:17.660]   That's a simulation or be a beaver on timberborn.
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:19.660]   That's a good one.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:22.940]   The only enemy in timberborn apparently is a drought.
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:25.900]   But yes, if you could survive drought.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:30.620]   As you said, Alex, before the show, it's all about water management.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.780]   It's a great game or you can play frostbunk and your enemy is the cold.
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:37.020]   I mean, like these are fun things.
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:38.020]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.380]   Lena Kahn, we were talking about her.
[02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:41.740]   I'm sorry, not Lena Kahn.
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:47.180]   And my other hero in the Biden administration, Jessica Warsenworsl.
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:49.860]   Warsenworsl, can you say this for me?
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:56.620]   Rosenworsl, chairman of the FCC, says everybody hates data caps.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:01.620]   But ISPs clearly, and I've been having this debate, I've had this debate for 20 years
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:02.620]   with John Z.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.620]   Dvorak.
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.060]   She's now confirming that I was right.
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:12.260]   ISPs clearly have the technical ability to offer unlimited data.
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:16.420]   It costs them very little.
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:23.700]   So the FCC has announced that there will be a notice of inquiry asking comments from you,
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:27.820]   the people, public, to better understand, quote, to better understand why the use of
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:33.220]   data caps continues to persist despite the increased broadband needs of consumers and
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:38.460]   providers demonstrated technical ability to offer unlimited data plans.
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:44.300]   Well, if you're going to download a fine new game like Diablo 4, Vol others Gate 3, you're
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:46.940]   going to download like what 60s, 70, 80, 90 gigs.
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:51.340]   And if you have 100 gigabyte data cap, well, no more internet for you.
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:56.220]   I used to have a terabyte a month cap on Comcast and I pay, and you know, this is obviously
[02:03:56.220 --> 02:04:00.780]   their plan, a huge amount of money not to have a data cap.
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.260]   Just because I don't want to have to think about it.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.260]   I hated it.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:09.380]   I get to the end of the month and say, you know, you've almost gone through your terabyte.
[02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:11.740]   So I used to have a cap on my Verizon plan.
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:15.580]   I did one of those old 10 gig plans before it all went to fake unlimited.
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:18.780]   And I went over a couple of times and that may be absolutely furious.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:21.740]   And then now they just thought, well, you have to a certain point, but this feels a
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:25.860]   lot like back in the day when you had to pay for like a certain number of SMS messages
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:26.860]   per month.
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:27.860]   Oh, God, yes.
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.860]   And it was like, you get 500 free text messages.
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:31.860]   It was a message.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:32.860]   It was crazy.
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:33.860]   And it was misery.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:36.020]   And you know what happened as a result?
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:37.020]   Go ahead.
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:38.020]   Tell us.
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:42.100]   And say like one thing that we had was actual competition in the mobile scene, a number of
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.140]   players, and then we saw an overall better consumer solution down the road.
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:48.420]   The problem with the ISP is that they're often effectively regional and op-lix.
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:53.460]   And so they're able to enact a greater tax on essentially normal usage of their product.
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:54.940]   Um, well, what happened?
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:55.940]   The FCC.
[02:04:55.940 --> 02:05:01.380]   What happened is what's app and Facebook messenger and telegram and a bunch of database
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.300]   messengers emerged.
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:05.020]   So you wouldn't have to pay.
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:06.020]   So then what they do?
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:11.180]   Well, now we better have data caps because we can't get our 10 cents a message anymore.
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:13.260]   So we're going to get you on the data.
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:18.380]   And I think there's a direct correlation between the cellular carriers trying to make
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:22.900]   money on text messages and then saying, well, instead, we'll make it on data.
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:25.940]   Um, yeah, that's a good call.
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:26.940]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:27.940]   Yeah.
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:28.940]   I mean, like no one likes their ISP.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:32.620]   I've literally, I think in my entire life, never heard someone say, you know what?
[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:33.700]   My ISP is fantastic.
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:34.700]   No complaints.
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:35.700]   Yeah.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.100]   Yes, you get is, it's fine.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:42.300]   And if by the way, if you do talk to somebody who likes their SP, you can't get it.
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:43.300]   Yeah.
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:44.300]   Yeah.
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.300]   It doesn't exist anymore.
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:46.300]   They're rocking.
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:52.100]   I have Rocky Mountain net and it's fantastic, but you have to be in the southwest corner
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:54.300]   of Montana to get it.
[02:05:54.300 --> 02:06:00.340]   Oh, well, actually we have a very good ISP here, which you guys can't get called sonic.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:03.260]   And they offer 10 gigabit symmetric fiber.
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:07.460]   And corn dogs and corn dogs for everyone.
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:16.980]   Meta has decided to lower the age requirement for quest VR headsets to 10 used to be 13.
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:22.540]   It's as if any 10 year old ever heard of Facebook, by the way, like anybody under the
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:25.420]   age of 20 cares about Facebook in any capacity.
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:30.740]   Oh, once the what by a meta quest, I think kids like met a like a VR initially.
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:31.740]   Sure.
[02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:32.740]   That's cool.
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:34.220]   And they want it's weird.
[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:36.700]   They want a lightsaber and say forget it.
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:42.140]   Are you going to tell your son about when Darth, is he listening?
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:43.940]   Oh, okay.
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:49.940]   So no, and my husband is like a vanguard against people's spoiling.
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:51.100]   Like he will jump.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.420]   He will tackle a person about to spoil.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.940]   So they're not, you're not going to say, Hey, you know, this guy Darth Vader who's invading
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:57.940]   you?
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:06:59.580]   No, no, you literally have like pull.
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:04.700]   We literally have like blacked out, not blacked out, but like we've literally like we won't
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:08.780]   read him some of his five minutes Star Wars stories to keep the secret.
[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.460]   We're like, cause he'll be, he'll be.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:15.420]   Are you, are you looking forward to the like, how old will he be when he can watch episode
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:18.100]   four or when a higher God, when he can watch empire?
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:19.100]   Probably.
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:21.060]   Well, he's seen he's seen one and two.
[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:22.540]   He's seen he's seen episode one episode.
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.980]   She's so right now as he knows it and some clone.
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:26.460]   You're making him watch it.
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:27.460]   Incredible.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:34.180]   He's the hero of, well, I wanted to do it in the machete order, which is so Drew McQueeny
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.380]   is a film writer.
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:38.540]   So really fantastic film writer.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:43.500]   And he used to do this thing called film nerd or film, I think film nerd 2.0 and he
[02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:48.060]   talked about introducing his kids to movies and like speaking about them critically to
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.260]   his kids and all such stuff.
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:50.900]   His kids are grown up now.
[02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:53.060]   He was going to write a book for a while.
[02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:57.180]   And he, one of his posts that really stuck with me was his, the way he introduced them
[02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:58.180]   the Star Wars.
[02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:04.980]   And it was he showed them four, five, then went back and showed them one, two, three and
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:07.060]   showed them six.
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:13.540]   And his justification for this was he was like, they, they went along for the ride in
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:14.540]   a new hope.
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:19.420]   They were, they were devastated by this like revelation and episode find in Empire strikes
[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:20.420]   back.
[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:25.980]   And then before finding out how it all worked out or like what happened, he made them go
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:28.580]   back because they wanted to know what happened.
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:30.420]   So you're in the steady order.
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:31.420]   I like that.
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.660]   Well, I think the machete order cuts out one.
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:36.980]   Like I think that's a specifically like one.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:38.660]   The idea is you follow Luke Skywalker.
[02:08:38.660 --> 02:08:40.180]   I want to cut it up a little.
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:45.700]   You follow his evolution by following his storyline, focusing on his storyline.
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:50.180]   So it's, so to go back, but we're doing it with him, like just in, just in order, like
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:53.620]   yeah, because the thing is, is like he's four, he'll be four and like a week.
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:56.940]   So he's not, he can't, it's hard for him to remember stuff like that, even though he's
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:59.220]   got a memory, like a steel trap sometimes.
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:05.140]   But yeah, he's so as of right now, like Anakin Skywalker is the hero of the Clone Wars to
[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:06.140]   him.
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:08.660]   So he'll, this will be, you should start with the and door, right?
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:09.900]   Isn't that the earliest?
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:10.900]   Is that the earliest one?
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:13.100]   I think no, that's after revenge of this.
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:15.060]   That's after revenge of the Sith.
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:16.060]   Oh, okay.
[02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:17.060]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.260]   And it's like it's right.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:21.340]   Here's the four Rogue One events of Rogue One.
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:26.660]   The USA Today unaccountably has an entire article on how to watch it and what orders there
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:27.660]   are.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.580]   Watch it in whatever order you feel like.
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:30.580]   I mean, honestly.
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:33.380]   Order of release, chronological with the TV series.
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:34.380]   Yeah.
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:35.380]   Yeah.
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:37.860]   See, I don't know that we'll do everything because like, you know, it's, we'll probably
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:41.700]   just do the movies and then he can watch the TV shows and stuff when he gets a little older.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:42.700]   Yeah.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:43.700]   That's a stir.
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:45.180]   He really loves, he loves lightsabers.
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:46.180]   He has a book.
[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:47.180]   It's really cool.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:49.940]   Just, it's called like, it's like lightsabers.
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:56.100]   It's a book of lightsabers and it's all just high res images of lightsabers from Star Wars
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:58.860]   and who they belong to in a short little bio.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:03.340]   And it's, they have light side and dark side and then like the new Jedi, like it's really
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:04.340]   cool.
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:05.340]   It's a cool little book.
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:06.780]   So, I mean, this is the new Grimm's fairy tales, right?
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:07.860]   He's four.
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.580]   This is like instead of fairy tales.
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:12.900]   This is his new, and I think that's actually what George Lucas wanted.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:14.420]   I think that was his old.
[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:15.420]   This is a new mythology.
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.340]   He really loves the hero's journey.
[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:18.340]   Yeah.
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:21.780]   Like, that's like his all time favorite, you know, say he loves Joseph Campbell.
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:27.260]   And so this is his hero's journey and he loved old pulp stuff like the Lone Ranger and,
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:29.940]   you know, all of those radio serials.
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:32.180]   And so this is, you know, that was his version of it.
[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:33.980]   And I think, you know, it's just really fun.
[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.700]   It's like a fun, it's a fun space opera.
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:40.540]   It's not, I like, I like people, I didn't get into Star Wars when I was a kid because
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:41.540]   I missed it.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:43.020]   Like I did, it wasn't in theaters.
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:45.980]   So the first time I was exposed to it, I was like 15.
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:46.980]   Yeah.
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:48.780]   When I was a kid, it was Howdy Duty.
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:50.260]   We didn't have Star Wars.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.860]   Oh, Howdy Duty time.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:52.860]   Okay.
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:54.780]   I've let this go on for a long time now.
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:55.780]   I'm going to jump in.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:56.780]   Yes.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:59.700]   Given that every single Star Wars movie is the same and they're all bad, does it matter?
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:01.020]   What order you wash them in?
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.020]   Ooh.
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.180]   Like, oh my God, what's that conversation?
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:05.180]   No, you know what?
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:10.460]   I love that Alex, Alex says this as the parent of a very small child because in a few years
[02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:11.980]   you're going to change your mind.
[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:12.980]   I'm telling you like it's good.
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:15.940]   I think that's the most important thing, Alex.
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:21.860]   They're kids stories and a for their perfect for a kid four years old because they are
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:23.980]   the children's stories.
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:24.980]   He's upset.
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:26.540]   Like he wants to watch lightsaber fights.
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:31.220]   We literally have a YouTube playlist called lightsaber battles and it is all just fights
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:32.220]   with lightsabers.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:35.020]   How does he feel about Disney?
[02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:38.580]   He's like, you know, he, well, we have, we live very close to Disneyland.
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:40.740]   So we have magic keys and we go a lot.
[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:46.020]   But he, are you going to add the hey Disney voice to your Amazon Echo?
[02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:47.020]   Absolutely not.
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:49.140]   We don't have any voice assistants in this house.
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:50.140]   We don't.
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:51.140]   We're not it.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:52.140]   We're not that kind of family.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:53.140]   Instant note.
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:54.140]   That was a hell no.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:55.140]   That was a hell no.
[02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:57.980]   No, I don't want any voice assistants in my house.
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:59.740]   I, it's just not a thing of interest.
[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:00.740]   You're smart.
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:06.500]   My father has dozens of, he had like boxes of like Google home minnies and a lot like
[02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:07.500]   it was, it was pandemics.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:11.300]   And whenever you said like, sir, a serious set alarm or whatever, the whole house would
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.980]   just go off like a bomb.
[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:13.980]   Yeah.
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:14.980]   Welcome to my house.
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:15.980]   Yeah.
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:16.980]   Terrible couple of years.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:17.980]   Oh, no.
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:18.980]   Welcome to my house.
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:19.980]   I have everywhere.
[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:20.980]   There is a voice assistant.
[02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:27.860]   I have Siri, Echo and Google side by side everywhere everywhere everywhere.
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:32.980]   And exactly like your father in law, if you say Echo, if you say the keyword, it wakes
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:37.140]   up in several different rooms and you have to say no, no, no, this one.
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.740]   If I ask Google to play a song, it plays everywhere.
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:40.740]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:41.820]   I also have Sonos.
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.820]   I have Sonos.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:43.820]   I have.
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:44.820]   I have Sonos.
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:45.820]   Yeah.
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:46.820]   But do you have the voice of Sonos?
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:47.820]   Nope.
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:48.820]   Absolutely not.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:49.820]   No, the non.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:50.820]   Yes.
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:51.820]   Same too.
[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:57.260]   Oh, if you say, Hey, Sonos, I get the owner of La Poyo Los Poyos Hermanos telling me.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:58.260]   Are you sorry?
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:00.060]   I can't do that.
[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:01.060]   Gus Fring.
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.860]   I got Gus Fring.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:04.340]   Man.
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:11.060]   It's a little creepy because it's clearly Gus Fring and he mostly can't do anything.
[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:13.100]   So he says, I'm a lot.
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:16.420]   I'm sorry.
[02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:17.420]   It's a little.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:18.420]   I wonder if I can play this.
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:19.420]   Is this?
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:20.420]   That's unnerving.
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:21.420]   Let's see if this.
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:24.420]   Let me turn on my sound and see if this is Gus Fring's voice.
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:25.420]   Hey, Sonos.
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:27.940]   What's playing?
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:30.500]   This is Superstar by Beach House.
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:31.500]   Yeah.
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:32.660]   See, it's Gus Fring answering.
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:33.660]   John Carlos.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:34.660]   Is it Oh, man?
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:35.660]   Like John Carlos.
[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:36.660]   One Carlos.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:37.660]   That's a procedure.
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:39.140]   I love him as an actual good.
[02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:41.980]   I'm not sure what I'm coming out of my speakers.
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:50.860]   Jan LaCoon, who is the one of the fathers of AI and is working on AI at meta, says,
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:51.860]   good news.
[02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:54.820]   AI won't destroy jobs forever.
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:57.780]   Just for now.
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:58.780]   Just for now.
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:13:59.780]   I got nothing.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:00.780]   There's a BBC headline.
[02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:01.780]   I just love it.
[02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:02.780]   What's to say about that?
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:03.780]   Yeah.
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:06.220]   I'll jump in here.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:10.220]   So how many technological revolutions have we had going back in time?
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:13.020]   Agriculture, wheel, industrial revolution.
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:16.020]   Are you going to go all through all of them?
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:17.020]   Five.
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:20.900]   Like I've really major ones, like probably between five and seven.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.900]   Sure.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.900]   Pick a number.
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:23.900]   You can bring in some smaller ones too.
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:24.900]   Make it 25.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:25.900]   Sure.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.340]   Unemployment right now in the US is like what?
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:29.340]   4% 3%.
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:30.340]   It's very, very low.
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:34.340]   I don't think this is going to be the first technological revolution that actually ends
[02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:35.340]   human employment.
[02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:37.380]   That's why I take it.
[02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:38.380]   I like that.
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:39.980]   This is going to impact jobs.
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:40.980]   Sure.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:41.980]   But everything has.
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:48.460]   So to me, the whole concern about AI taking over the economy is a little hyperbolic.
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:52.780]   So this to me is more him saying, look, things are going to change, but it'll be okay.
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:55.140]   And I far be a familiar with meta on something.
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:58.420]   But yeah, I think Jan LaCoon is dead on here.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:14:59.420]   He's right.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:00.420]   Yeah.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:01.420]   Don't worry about it.
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:02.420]   It's going to be fine.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:06.700]   Speaking of ISPs, Comcast has complained to the FCC.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:11.660]   The FCC has passed this bill or Congress passed this bill that you'd have to have these broadband
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:21.140]   facts, just like nutrition labels next to your bill next to your bill next to your advertisements
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:25.180]   so that consumers will know exactly what speed you're going to get at what price and
[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:26.380]   so forth.
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:32.620]   And then finally last week, Comcast told the FCC is we can't.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:34.300]   It's too complicated.
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:36.440]   It's too hard.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.440]   We don't well.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:40.220]   Have they ever tried to cancel themselves?
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:41.860]   Yeah, that's hard to.
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:42.860]   Yeah.
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:43.860]   That's really hard too.
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:44.860]   It's really complicated.
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:45.860]   But you know what?
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:47.860]   I know people who have done it.
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:51.020]   Yeah, but it's that this is an admission of guilt, right?
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:52.020]   This is not a difference.
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:56.220]   This is saying you're like you do need this system because we can't even do it ourselves
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:59.900]   and I think I hope I hope the government says, okay, then maybe you should make it simpler.
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:01.980]   Yeah, like really, that's the answer.
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:02.980]   That's the response.
[02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:03.980]   Exactly right.
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:10.060]   I would point out Comcast billing software seems to be able to figure it out consistently
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:12.340]   in fact, every month for everybody on time.
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:13.340]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:15.780]   So weird how that happens.
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:21.340]   Comcast doesn't actually want to show you how much it's going to cost.
[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:22.340]   That's the fact.
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:26.020]   That's like, you know, cheesecake factory went crazy when they said, oh, you got to put
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:28.380]   the calorie counts next to everything on the menu.
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:29.380]   It's like, it's the same thing.
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:31.860]   It was like, we can't possibly calculate this.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:34.380]   Like, have you seen the size of our portions?
[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:35.940]   We can't print them in these zeros.
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:36.940]   We're not out of ink.
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:38.780]   There's too many zeros here.
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:40.620]   People will think it's the price.
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:41.620]   Oh, wow.
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:43.420]   That 10 points for that joke.
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:45.220]   That was actually fantastic.
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:50.300]   But this reminds me a little bit of my my my family's Verizon bill.
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:53.540]   Everyone they get a text saying, thank you for paying this.
[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:55.460]   This was charged to your your account.
[02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:58.540]   And it just feels like a random number that goes up by two percent a month.
[02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:01.980]   And I swear to God, in like five years, it's going to be an infinite amount of money.
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:02.980]   Yes.
[02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.780]   But I have no idea why how the number was put together.
[02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:06.220]   Like zero idea.
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:08.220]   They just take some money every month and I go, huh.
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:09.220]   Okay.
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.580]   And that's how I feel about my ISP as well.
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:13.180]   So simplifying this makes a lot of sense.
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:17.780]   And I hope that the seven people who work at the FCC can take on a industry worth several
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:20.980]   hundred billion dollars more power to.
[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:23.980]   It's just so funny that they they we can't figure this out.
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:27.980]   Our billing software can, but we're not going to we're not going to figure this out.
[02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:28.980]   And let's take a quick break.
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:34.220]   Want to wrap things up and I got to find out about Rowdy Skeleton, which is your brand
[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:35.940]   new business, right?
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:36.940]   Yeah.
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:40.620]   This is my we launched a media training company.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:41.900]   I'm excited about it.
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:43.060]   What's media training?
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:44.420]   What does that mean?
[02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:49.340]   Well, you know, when you see somebody from a company and they are on something like a
[02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:53.700]   developer direct or if they are talking to the press.
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:59.420]   Really executives get extensive media training, but there are lots of people at companies
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:03.660]   who don't get media training and they should because we there are a lot of companies out
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:08.620]   there who wish they had more people who could speak eloquently and impactfully about the
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:11.420]   business and services they provide.
[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:21.540]   And so instead of leaning on your, you know, your PR arm or your HR arm to help your employees
[02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:26.100]   speak on camera, which can be very difficult and is often a very specific skill set.
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:27.900]   Leo, you know what's up with that.
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:28.900]   Well, I'm telling myself.
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:29.900]   I'm crazy.
[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:34.500]   Am I doing something, anything that you would note doing something wrong?
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:35.500]   You're great, Leo.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:36.500]   You're a legend.
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:37.500]   You're an icon.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:43.700]   I was so insulted because tech TV brought in a media training person and we were all
[02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:47.300]   supposed to bring our tapes and sit down and I was so insulted.
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:52.180]   It's like, I don't want, I don't want to be trained by you.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:54.980]   I don't even know what you're, but this is already a host.
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:56.380]   I was already on TV.
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:57.380]   Exactly.
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:58.380]   Yeah, this is for it.
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:02.100]   We like to train people who are who are nervous on camera.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.660]   How do you train people to be better on camera?
[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:07.620]   I would like to know that we do a lot of different things.
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:15.140]   I mean, recently we just did a we built from the ground up a workshop for Microsoft for
[02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:16.300]   the Xbox team.
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:22.220]   And a lot of the employee, full-time employees at Microsoft who were part of the program,
[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:24.300]   were very scared to be on camera.
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:30.340]   And we created a week-long workshop that involved them learning how to read teleprompter
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:32.820]   better, doing things like-
[02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:36.180]   Do you dress up as Lilith and jump out from behind the camera?
[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:37.180]   Totally.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:38.180]   Just scare people.
[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:40.220]   Yeah, just to get the people 100%.
[02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:41.220]   I will do that.
[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:45.380]   If the price is right, I will be to train you anyway that you prefer.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:48.060]   But yeah, we did a really fun workshop.
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:51.660]   And by the end of the week, even after the first day, we showed them the very first thing
[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:54.180]   they did on camera and then the last thing that was the recent thing.
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:55.740]   And they couldn't believe the difference.
[02:19:55.740 --> 02:19:58.220]   I mean, it's such a stark difference for so many of them.
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:04.220]   And to give them that sense of confidence and really get them to a headspace where we
[02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:09.780]   also do things like we train people on abuse, online abuse and harassment prevention.
[02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:11.780]   We tell people how to protect their peace.
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:12.780]   How do you do that?
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:14.940]   You start appearing on camera.
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:22.180]   And that comes from my many years of experience being harassed by people on the internet.
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:24.500]   How do you keep your peace?
[02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:25.500]   How do you?
[02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:26.500]   Because I'm working on that.
[02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:27.500]   I don't know if I'm breaking it.
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:28.500]   Log out.
[02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:29.500]   Log out.
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:30.500]   Yeah.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:36.500]   Now, big one is- for me, a really big one is I tend to- my first one is I always tell
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:39.980]   all my friends and family, "Please do not go fight for me on the internet."
[02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:42.580]   That's such a big one that a lot of people don't do.
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:43.580]   They don't think about it.
[02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:44.580]   Don't engage.
[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:45.580]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:49.180]   It's like you cannot go defend me on the internet to everybody who doesn't like me.
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:54.180]   And then also the other part of the second half of that is you won't be for everybody
[02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:55.180]   and that's okay.
[02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:56.180]   Right.
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:57.180]   Like, it's totally fine.
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:20:59.020]   You will not be for everybody.
[02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:00.020]   And that's fine.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:01.780]   You're going to have people who find you very annoying.
[02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:04.340]   I'm sure there are people listening right now who find me very annoying.
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:05.340]   And that's okay.
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:08.300]   I totally respect your opinion.
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:11.500]   I mean, if people who are listening right now find you annoying Leo, I'm not sure what
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:15.700]   they're doing listening, but I would argue that you'll offer you.
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:19.700]   This always puzzled me, but there are people who hate watch or hate listen.
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:20.700]   That's true.
[02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:22.700]   There are some new watchers who shut up to offer haters.
[02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:24.700]   I'm going to listen to you.
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:25.700]   Every day.
[02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:27.940]   I'll tell you everything you're doing wrong.
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:36.380]   It's the first- I would not choose to be in the public eye if, I mean, don't do it unless
[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:39.740]   you really won't have to because- Yeah.
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:42.460]   As soon as you stick your head on- They're so near.
[02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.940]   You're going to send me to the truck and chop it out.
[02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:45.940]   Yeah.
[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:50.980]   But there's also, you know, the one thing that I think we have seen and continue to see is,
[02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:55.500]   you know, there are a lot of companies out there who really want to diversify their stable
[02:21:55.500 --> 02:22:02.340]   of on-camera talent because, you know, maybe they do have a very diverse pool of employees,
[02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:05.900]   but not necessarily, they are not necessarily diverse at the top, which like that's its
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:06.900]   own issue.
[02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:11.140]   But maybe they want to train more people to talk about what they do specifically at a
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:12.140]   company.
[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:19.020]   What do you think about Apple's decision to not do events in person anymore, to pre-record
[02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:23.780]   something and then show it on a screen?
[02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:26.700]   I really like it.
[02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:33.180]   I think that there is a love of live events that I have that, you know, because there
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:35.220]   is that, oh, anything can happen.
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:36.220]   Yeah.
[02:22:36.220 --> 02:22:37.220]   I really like that.
[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:38.740]   Apple, I really like that.
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:40.620]   And I do think that they-
[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:44.460]   But Apple doesn't want that for good reason.
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:46.380]   But he also, there's also a loss there, right?
[02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:50.740]   When you take away the live event, you don't get like the raucous applause of a crowd,
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.740]   right?
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:55.900]   Which, and to some extent, that can be really exciting and help you do a better job on stage
[02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:57.500]   because you really feel the energy.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:58.500]   Yeah.
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:22:59.500]   That's why we-
[02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:02.900]   By the way, that's why we do these shows live in front of an audience.
[02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:04.500]   Yeah, it's like exciting.
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:08.580]   It's always going to have more energy and be better if you don't have a second take available
[02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:09.780]   to you, I think.
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:10.780]   Right.
[02:23:10.780 --> 02:23:15.740]   And so, but I think Apple really, just in and of themselves, they are a very-
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:17.540]   They're a company that is very much all about control.
[02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:18.540]   Yeah.
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:19.540]   Well, they're about control.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:23.420]   They have a very controlled image brand, you know, a message.
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:25.100]   Like they're very tight on their messaging.
[02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:30.060]   Like, and for all of the fun and jokes we make, we can make about things like, you know,
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:34.460]   the reality distortion feels like that is, you know, that is a-
[02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:38.060]   That's a real thing that Apple has done a very good job of curating.
[02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:39.900]   Like, they're very good curators.
[02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:40.900]   Yeah.
[02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:45.860]   Both externally and also like internally with their message, they are laser focused on that
[02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:46.860]   stuff.
[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:49.660]   And so it didn't surprise me that they moved to that and I think the pandemic gave them
[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:53.060]   a very good excuse to move to that format.
[02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:57.740]   But it also is- It's hard because you're, you know, you do get a lot of takes, but the
[02:23:57.740 --> 02:24:01.460]   thing is, you know, if you don't know how to read teleprompter the right way, like,
[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:03.020]   it's still going to look like you're reading.
[02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:07.660]   And there are executives that I can still see, like Apple and other companies that are very
[02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:10.660]   clearly like reading off a teleprompter because they're not good at it.
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:15.740]   And they're also, I mean, we've all seen, we see like the Oscars where an actor, this,
[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:19.580]   you know, getting paid $20 million a movie just cannot read a teleprompter to save their
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:20.580]   life.
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:21.580]   It's a very specific skill.
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:22.580]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:25.980]   Who was on that Samsung event?
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:27.580]   It was a director, right?
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:28.580]   Michael Bay.
[02:24:28.580 --> 02:24:29.580]   Michael Bay.
[02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:30.580]   The prompter went down.
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:31.580]   I'll never forget that.
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:32.580]   I'll never forget it.
[02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:34.540]   He lost it and he left.
[02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:35.540]   He left.
[02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:37.180]   He stormed off stage.
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:38.180]   Wow.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.180]   Do you remember that, Alex?
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:40.180]   Do you remember that?
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:41.180]   It was at CES.
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:45.260]   No, I've been to a number of CES's, but that was back when I still drank.
[02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:46.820]   So I don't really remember many of them.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:50.260]   It's a truly iconic moment in CES's history.
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:53.780]   Here's a little bit of it if you want to see it.
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.420]   Director and producer Michael Bay.
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:25:00.260]   This is so awkward.
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:02.260]   So this is a Samsung reveal.
[02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:03.260]   Thank you, Michael.
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:06.980]   You're getting this famous director out here.
[02:25:06.980 --> 02:25:12.620]   My job as a director is I get to dream for a living.
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:17.100]   Michael, you're known for some unbelievable action.
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:18.100]   What inspires you?
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:19.580]   How do you come up with these unbelievable ideas?
[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:20.580]   This is all in prompter.
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:25.340]   I create visual worlds that are so beyond everyone's normal life experiences.
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:30.500]   Hollywood is a place that creates a viewer.
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:31.500]   He is not.
[02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:32.500]   No idea what he's going to say.
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:33.500]   I try to do.
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.420]   As a director, I try to.
[02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:39.060]   He also seems very nervous.
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:40.420]   This is causing me physical pain.
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:42.420]   I'm sorry, but I'll just wing this.
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:43.420]   Tell us what you think.
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:44.420]   Yeah.
[02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:46.620]   We'll wing it right now.
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:47.620]   I take that.
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:49.180]   This is probably why he's behind the camera.
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.180]   The emotional ride.
[02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:52.140]   Not in front of the camera.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:53.140]   He can't remember any of the points.
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:54.140]   But anybody can learn this.
[02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:55.140]   Yeah.
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:57.020]   This makes me want to die inside.
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:25:59.020]   How do you think it's going to impact?
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:00.940]   I think Michael Bay died inside.
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:02.260]   He walks off eventually.
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.260]   Excuse me.
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:04.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:05.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:06.260]   That's it.
[02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:07.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:08.260]   Michael Bay.
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:09.260]   Thank you.
[02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:12.860]   We just paid him half a million dollars for nothing.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:13.860]   Okay.
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:15.700]   So a couple of things.
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:20.140]   One, people who enjoy being on stage are a different breed.
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:21.140]   I'm actually only.
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:22.140]   Are you shy?
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.140]   I've done.
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:24.140]   Yeah.
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:25.140]   I'm not shy introvert.
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:26.460]   I fake it here and there.
[02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:29.180]   But I get what happened to him.
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:32.540]   Also don't tell a prompt and script a conversation because it'll always sound like that.
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:33.820]   It always sounds terrible.
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:34.820]   Yes.
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:39.180]   But going back to the Apple conversation, I want to say that I do agree that it is a
[02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:43.980]   better way for a company without a singular star to create a consistent product.
[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:48.900]   It is a very powerful multi hour infomercial that nerds myself still tune into.
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.340]   Yeah, we all watched to say though.
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:51.940]   We were all glued to it.
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:52.940]   Yeah.
[02:26:52.940 --> 02:26:53.940]   Never missed one.
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:59.940]   So let's go back and watch Steve Jobs introduce the first iPhone and watch how that event he's
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:00.940]   felt.
[02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:01.940]   He's brilliant.
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:02.940]   Versus.
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:03.940]   Oh, yeah.
[02:27:03.940 --> 02:27:06.820]   Every other of these pre recorded things because it has taken the soul out of it and
[02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:11.700]   allowed them to essentially turn it into a commercial that is not compelling in the
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:12.700]   same way.
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:13.700]   And so to me, there has been something lost there.
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:17.460]   Maybe it was never preservable, but it's definitely, I think, I don't think the video
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:18.700]   stuff is as good.
[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:20.100]   No, that was my feeling.
[02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:22.140]   But I think Ashley is right.
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:24.140]   I mean, how many Steve Jobs are there?
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:25.140]   Right.
[02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:31.500]   And, you know, it's probably a lot safer.
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:32.500]   But I do agree.
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:36.660]   You lose a lot of energy, but that's why I like live music compared to recording music.
[02:27:36.660 --> 02:27:39.860]   It's why I like live theater compared to movies.
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:45.700]   I like live because it's made of people.
[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:49.100]   And the canned stuff has somewhat soulless, somewhat soulless.
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:51.860]   But I can train you for both, whatever you need.
[02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:53.740]   I am so thrilled that you're doing this.
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:58.820]   You and Ross Miller, two people who really know what they're doing with many thousands
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:03.220]   of hours on camera time, time in front of the microphone.
[02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:04.980]   Yeah, and behind it.
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:08.580]   I mean, we both are producers and Ross is a development person.
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:14.100]   And we've, you know, we've spent a lot of time just, you know, and just by proxy of having
[02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:19.060]   been around, you know, for a while, it's like you just pick up little things that maybe
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:22.060]   you know, you don't get trained on.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:26.500]   And also, you know, there's a lot of PR teams and stuff out there who are just being crushed
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:28.340]   by the workload they have.
[02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:30.860]   And it's like, just you can always call us.
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:34.220]   Like if you're overwhelmed, you can't do it, then you can just call us.
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:35.300]   And we're happy to do it.
[02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:37.380]   And we scale the size.
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:40.340]   So it's like we can do the biggest companies and the smallest startups.
[02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:42.260]   Like we're happy to do it.
[02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:46.060]   Some people are naturals at it, but everybody can learn how to do it, I think.
[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:49.660]   And everyone can learn how to be compelling and natural on camera.
[02:28:49.660 --> 02:28:50.980]   But you have to learn it.
[02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:52.900]   It's not, it's not something that counts now.
[02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:56.740]   I was terrible for on the, I started on the radio.
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:57.700]   I was on the radio.
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:28:59.500]   I was terrible for 10 years.
[02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:01.300]   I mean, really bad.
[02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:02.780]   And I was awful.
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:03.780]   Yeah.
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:08.180]   Until I, until I, you know, I didn't want, had enough hours under my belt, but also I
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:13.580]   think until I stopped trying to appeal to people and gave up.
[02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:17.980]   As soon as I thought, it's not until I gave up that I gave up.
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:19.180]   That started going well.
[02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:21.780]   Honestly, I think that happens a lot of the time.
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:25.980]   It's like you try to, you're trying to force a square peg into a round hole and it doesn't
[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:26.980]   worry.
[02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:29.020]   And then once you give up on that and you're just like, I'm just going to do this and see
[02:29:29.020 --> 02:29:30.020]   what happens.
[02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:31.020]   I was ingratiating.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:32.020]   Best part.
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:33.420]   And it was ingratiating is annoying.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:35.580]   I just said screw it out with you.
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:36.580]   I don't like here.
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:40.180]   Even Alex says he's like, you know, the, the Alex, you were saying like banter and stuff.
[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:41.180]   Like don't script that.
[02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:43.540]   But it's like, no, we, we, you can teach that.
[02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:44.540]   You can teach.
[02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:46.700]   I have natural, you can write that script.
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:48.900]   You can write, you can write that banter.
[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:53.220]   Every movie you've ever seen, every TV show you ever seen, the banner is scripted, but
[02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:57.780]   you can deliver it if you know what you're doing in a natural way.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:59.660]   It's true.
[02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:04.020]   But that is one good lesson, which is if you have some, a untrained don't, don't give
[02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:06.820]   them a script because they are painful.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:07.820]   Yeah.
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:08.820]   Yeah.
[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:09.820]   Yeah.
[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:11.420]   It's for them, especially, I mean, it's for your company too, but I mean for them also,
[02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:12.420]   it's like, that's really hard.
[02:30:12.420 --> 02:30:13.420]   It's really scary.
[02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:15.460]   What is it that wasn't there an old thing?
[02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:19.500]   I was like, people were more afraid of public speaking than just like, it's the scariest
[02:30:19.500 --> 02:30:20.500]   thing.
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.980]   We, everybody's had a dream of standing in front of an audience naked or whatever.
[02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:24.980]   And it's just terrifying.
[02:30:24.980 --> 02:30:29.660]   So instead go to rowdy skeleton.com and get a little training.
[02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:36.900]   I think that's absolutely required for any business that has any public component.
[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:42.380]   And I really agree about the online preparing people for the inevitable, uh, harassment
[02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:44.260]   is also very important.
[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:45.860]   I wish I'd done that with a lot of our.
[02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:46.860]   And it is inevitable.
[02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:48.780]   Because it is inevitable and nothing you can do about it.
[02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:49.780]   Even in a small amount.
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:50.780]   It's inevitable.
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:51.780]   Yeah.
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:52.780]   Yeah.
[02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:53.780]   Yeah.
[02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:54.780]   Everybody while you're doing it in public.
[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:55.780]   So everybody has an opinion.
[02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:56.780]   Yep.
[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:57.780]   Yep.
[02:30:57.780 --> 02:30:58.780]   Let me, let me take a break.
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:02.060]   Some final thoughts with our wonderful panel, Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch.
[02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:08.220]   Ashley is Sketha of rowdy skeleton and our new book, Art of Psychonauts 2.
[02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:11.060]   Our show today brought to you by Grammarly Go.
[02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:13.540]   Hey, if you're writing, it's awesome.
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:18.060]   We tried it in beta for a long time because we're all doing a lot more communicating than
[02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:19.060]   ever before.
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:22.420]   Whether you're writing a thank you note or creating a business plan, give yourself a
[02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:24.860]   helping hand with Grammarly Go.
[02:31:24.860 --> 02:31:30.780]   It's a communication assistant powered by yes, generative AI.
[02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:33.900]   It's really a fun thing to have by your side.
[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:38.300]   And it is a great way to solve writer's block to get you unstuck to get you even with an
[02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:40.900]   email or a note.
[02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:43.100]   It helps you compose intelligently.
[02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:45.740]   You write the prompt into Grammarly Go.
[02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:48.620]   It will generate high quality writing.
[02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:51.180]   So you don't have to do all that word smithing.
[02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:55.900]   But then you can also personalize it, customize your style of communication.
[02:31:55.900 --> 02:31:58.180]   There's a button called set voice.
[02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:03.700]   You can use the tone indicator at the top of the Grammarly Go window and then personalize
[02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:05.140]   your tone.
[02:32:05.140 --> 02:32:10.860]   If you want it to be more formal or more casual or kind of neutral, you can choose personable
[02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:17.820]   confident, empathetic, engaging, witty or direct.
[02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:24.140]   Sometimes when Lisa and I are writing emails to staff, direct is not the problem.
[02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:26.020]   We maybe want to soften it up a little bit.
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:27.740]   Grammarly Go will help you with that.
[02:32:27.740 --> 02:32:32.420]   Grammarly Go understands your unique context, your preferred voice.
[02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:36.940]   But even more importantly, your goals to generate high quality writing quickly with
[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:38.540]   just a few quick clicks.
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:42.380]   You can ideate, you can compose, you can rewrite, you can reply thoughtfully.
[02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:46.220]   And by the way, you don't have to provide it with a prompt.
[02:32:46.220 --> 02:32:50.780]   You can actually send it text and have it rewrite for tone clarity and length.
[02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:55.820]   Grammarly Go helps you fine tune your writing to reflect your personal style and be effective
[02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:57.260]   in any situation.
[02:32:57.260 --> 02:32:59.940]   Select the text you want to rewrite it, activate Grammarly Go.
[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:01.220]   Boom, it's rewritten.
[02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:04.140]   Sounds more exciting maybe or more professional.
[02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:06.860]   May, maybe more direct, more inspirational.
[02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:08.220]   You can do that.
[02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:10.220]   It's really a fun tool.
[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:12.380]   You'll be amazed at what you can do with GrammarlyGo.

[02:33:17.380 --> 02:33:20.100]   Another thing I'm going to throw into this ad.
[02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:23.540]   Grammarly is a fantastic software company.
[02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:26.100]   Out of Ukraine, they are working hard.
[02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:27.100]   They deserve our support.
[02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:28.460]   They're doing a great job.
[02:33:28.460 --> 02:33:29.820]   They make a great product.
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:35.900]   G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y, Grammarly.com/Go.
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:36.900]   Give it a try.
[02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:40.420]   You'll try it out and I think you'll be very impressed.
[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:42.380]   Grammarly Go.
[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:43.860]   We had a fun week this week on Twitter.
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:45.100]   Oh, indeed we did.
[02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:46.100]   Thank goodness.
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:49.780]   We've memorialized this in this fabulous video.
[02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:54.780]   Did you read the New Yorker article on the people in the Taco Bell's innovation lab?
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:57.220]   I don't think I'm going to print out here somewhere to read that.
[02:33:57.220 --> 02:33:58.220]   Yes.
[02:33:58.220 --> 02:33:59.220]   You could read it right here.
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.220]   I've used my free article Stacy.
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:03.220]   Oh, I now subscribe to the New Yorker.
[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:05.020]   I was subscribed to the New Yorker.
[02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:06.660]   What is wrong with you, my friend?
[02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:08.660]   You look like a New Yorker too.
[02:34:08.660 --> 02:34:09.660]   I know.
[02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:11.260]   You look like an Eddy Marenkert.
[02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:13.460]   Previously on Twit.
[02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:14.980]   Tech News Weekly.
[02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:21.820]   Apollo's developer Christian Selig joins us to talk about the Reddit blackout and why
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:25.220]   Apollo may be closing down on June 30th.
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:28.860]   There's been weird allegations where they said I've tried the blackmailed them and stuff,
[02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:33.860]   which thankfully I recorded the call and said it showed that wasn't the case at all.
[02:34:33.860 --> 02:34:37.540]   So there's like kind of this bad blood aspect where they really seem to hate third party
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:38.780]   apps for some reason.
[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:39.780]   Windows Weekly.
[02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:45.340]   The government is suing to keep Microsoft from sneaking in buying Activision.
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:47.860]   I read the FTC play the other way around.
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:52.460]   This looks like a mechanism to force the FTC to make a decision.
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:56.380]   Like the reason to get the injunction is to expedite the case.
[02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:57.940]   Club Twit exclusive.
[02:34:57.940 --> 02:35:02.380]   What got you into the whole open source world to begin with?
[02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:09.100]   Also in March of 1999, back in the before times, I had a car accident.
[02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:11.780]   My head went through the window and I had amnesia.
[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:12.780]   Wow.
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:15.660]   And still, I don't remember anything before March of '99.
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:22.900]   We couldn't afford to have me retrain myself to do IT and Linux was free.
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:24.340]   Twit.tv.
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:27.820]   Your source for the latest tech insights.
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:29.140]   And learn a lot about our hosts.
[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:32.060]   I had no idea Sean had that experience.
[02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:34.020]   That's fascinating.
[02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:39.100]   If you are not yet a member of Club Twit, don't forget that Sean Powers interview and many of
[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:43.340]   the things that happen happen in our Club Twit Discord including.
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:44.620]   I'm very excited.

[02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:52.900]   Silo, the Apple TV Plus series that's coming up in a couple of weeks.

[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:26.580]   It's just a great community of other Twit listeners talking about everything that geeks
[02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:29.300]   love including comic books and videos.
[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:30.500]   And yes, animated gifts.
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:31.980]   You see, yes.

[02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:36.540]   Seven bucks a month.
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:39.740]   It's not expensive but it sure makes a difference to us.
[02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:44.340]   Thank you in advance.
[02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:47.860]   I think we pretty much covered everything.
[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:51.180]   I should mention that story we were talking about on Windows Weekly.
[02:36:51.180 --> 02:37:00.180]   The FTC was worried that Microsoft would just go and merge with Blizzard just anyway.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:05.660]   So they actually got an injunction from a judge, a temporary restraining order saying
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:09.380]   you can't make the deal while reviews go through.
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:10.380]   Is that unusual?
[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:19.980]   Alex, it seems to me that they would say it's on hold until the FTC is final.
[02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:25.460]   I don't want to get too far over my skis here because this is a part of law involving technology
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:28.020]   where I'm not the greatest expert.
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:32.420]   But if they were concerned about that, we have to at least presume that it was a possibility.
[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.460]   I think Microsoft is planning it.
[02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:35.460]   Yeah.
[02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:36.460]   Yeah.
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:39.660]   And don't forget what Microsoft's top lawyer said about the UK's complaints about the deal.
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:41.260]   He was brutal about it.
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:43.860]   So I think these companies are pretty much accustomed to getting their way and don't
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:47.620]   like being told no and we're going to force this through.
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:50.620]   And so I'm proud that the US government had discovered that it has at least a couple
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:52.220]   of vertebrae in its spine.
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.220]   Congratulations.
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:54.220]   Go team.
[02:37:54.220 --> 02:37:55.220]   Yeah.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:38:00.500]   And Microsoft can't sneak in the acquisition ahead of time.
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:04.580]   The administrative judge hears the case in the US in August.
[02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:06.180]   I don't think the UK is backing down.
[02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:11.100]   I think Microsoft is going to appeal that this is all about the merger with Ashley's
[02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:16.620]   husband and brother, the Activision Blizzard Ischetha merger.
[02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:20.980]   Sorry for my comments about the merger.
[02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:23.980]   Maybe, maybe it'll be cool.
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:25.780]   Look, I'm a new show.
[02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:27.620]   I'm like genuinely a neutral third party.
[02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:29.380]   I'm like, I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:30.620]   And so I'm just watching it.
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:33.820]   I'm just kind of here with popcorn being like, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:37.220]   But hopefully whatever happens means that my husband still has a job.
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:38.620]   Like that's all I care about.
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:40.620]   I like health insurance.
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:44.220]   So that's all I care about.
[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:46.380]   What is your now your husband's doing the e-sports thing.
[02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:48.300]   What's your brother doing there?
[02:38:48.300 --> 02:38:50.260]   He's a game producer on World of Warcraft.
[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:52.300]   Oh, nice.
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:58.100]   He started his my brother started his Blizzard career on Diablo three doing QA.
[02:38:58.100 --> 02:38:59.980]   Oh, that's so cool.
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:07.580]   So he, I like to say I tell him he got his job because of me because he was very bummed
[02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:08.580]   out.
[02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:11.140]   He had gone through a breakup and was like very miserable.
[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:14.820]   And I was like, Hey, I got to go cover the World of Warcraft cataclysm launch.
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:16.180]   Like, can you just come with me?
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:18.100]   And he was like, I go, I need a camera guy.
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:19.100]   So just come with me.
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:20.100]   He's like, okay.
[02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:24.300]   So we went and we ended up just like because we both had already pre-ordered the game,
[02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:25.660]   we didn't have to wait in the big line.
[02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:30.740]   And I was just covering it for YouTube and for my YouTube channel.
[02:39:30.740 --> 02:39:35.300]   And so we just happened to sit down to a next to a guy at the food trucks who worked
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:38.100]   at Blizzard and who was working on Diablo and was like, you should apply.
[02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:42.340]   You'd be, you'd be great at, you know, you'd be, you, I think you would love it at Blizzard.
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:44.780]   And he was just like, I don't know why I'm going to get a job at Blizzard.
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:49.060]   And he, because he was working at Target, he was working in electronics department at Target
[02:39:49.060 --> 02:39:50.460]   at the time.
[02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:54.380]   And so he got a QA job on Diablo three and then he's been there ever since.
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:57.340]   And he worked his way up and he's now producing World of Warcraft.
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:59.860]   Game producer on World of Warcraft.
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:00.940]   That's pretty amazing.
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:02.580]   I'm very proud of him.
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:05.820]   He's like, first of all, my brother's awesome and we love video games and we play Diablo
[02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:07.580]   like literally every night.
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:12.300]   He's, if you think I'm a Diablo fan, like he's like, I don't even.
[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:14.660]   Did your mother when you were a kid say, what are you going to do?
[02:40:14.660 --> 02:40:16.660]   Are you going to play video games for a living?
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:19.660]   No, that was my, that was my dad.
[02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:21.620]   That was my dad.
[02:40:21.620 --> 02:40:24.380]   My dad, my dad now tells all of his patients.
[02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:27.540]   He's like, yeah, I used to tell my son all the time, like you got to get outside, play
[02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:28.540]   less video games.
[02:40:28.540 --> 02:40:29.540]   Like I'm really kicking myself.
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.700]   I can't believe I was totally wrong.
[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:35.340]   My mom was actually, she bought me an NES when I was three.
[02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:40.500]   And for my third birthday, my NES, my Nintendo and I used to watch her play video games and
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:42.140]   that was how I got into games.
[02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:44.140]   So your mom was a gamer.
[02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:45.780]   She totally bought it for herself.
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:47.500]   She did not buy an NES for a three year old.
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:49.340]   She bought it for herself.
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:53.660]   And so yeah, my, I remember watching my mom and just thinking she was like amazing because
[02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:56.900]   she was playing Castlevania to Simon's Quest.
[02:40:56.900 --> 02:41:02.100]   And I just thought she was a genius for finding the invisible mansion.
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:06.580]   So you're not going to have any trouble if your son decides he wants to play video games
[02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:07.580]   and yeah, it's fine.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:08.580]   It's fine.
[02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:10.460]   But he loves, he loves music.
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:11.460]   He loves it.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:12.620]   He's, who knows what he's going to do.
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:14.780]   He's like, he contains multitudes.
[02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:18.260]   I think to some degree, the worst thing you could do is say no matter what, you can't
[02:41:18.260 --> 02:41:21.180]   play video games because that makes it this forbidden fruit.
[02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:23.100]   And then it's all of a sudden.
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:25.300]   We play, we play a little Mario Kart.
[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:29.820]   Like he's got, we don't play a lot of video games, but he's, but we play some.
[02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:31.860]   He likes Animal Crossing and Mario Kart.
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:36.900]   And he calls Splatoon Squid Game, which is very funny to me.
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:38.740]   He's like, mommy, let's play Squid Game.
[02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:41.860]   And I'm like, let's not play Squid Game because that is very dangerous.
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:42.860]   But we could play Splatoon.
[02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:43.860]   That's fine.
[02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:45.900]   I am going to let you go be with your husband.
[02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:48.860]   Wish him a happy Father's Day.
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:55.700]   I apologize for dragging you away on this special special day, but have a one.
[02:41:55.700 --> 02:41:57.060]   It's so great to see you Ashley.
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:59.060]   Thank you for being here.
[02:41:59.060 --> 02:42:01.980]   Happy to show up and not shut up about anything.
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:02.980]   Thanks for having me.
[02:42:02.980 --> 02:42:04.820]   I don't want you ever to shut about anything.
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:06.300]   Routyskeleton.com.
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:11.420]   If you want to hire Ashley and Ross to do your media training, it's a must have.
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:16.580]   And look for the art of Psychonauts 2 comes out this what sometime in the next.
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:17.580]   I think this summer.
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:18.580]   Yeah, this summer.
[02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:20.380]   Next couple of months.
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:22.220]   Art of Psychonauts 2.
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:24.300]   And of course, on the Twitter, Ashley is.
[02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:25.460]   Thank you, Ashley.
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:26.460]   ESQEDA.
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.460]   Yes.
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:29.500]   Thank you, Ashley.
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:32.020]   Real new father, six month father.
[02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:35.940]   This is your first Father's Day and please apologize to Liza.
[02:42:35.940 --> 02:42:38.980]   I am so grateful to her that Alex could be here.
[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:39.980]   Alex Wilhelm.
[02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:40.980]   Proud pop.
[02:42:40.980 --> 02:42:42.660]   Yeah, well, I haven't gone to and said hi.
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.220]   So it's been three hours of me not knowing how bedtime went.
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:47.100]   So we'll see how it goes when I get back in the house.
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:48.940]   If she's mad, have her call me.
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:49.940]   OK?
[02:42:49.940 --> 02:42:51.100]   Oh, trust me, I will.
[02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:56.540]   And I know a secret place in the basement where she can lock you.
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:43:00.300]   You don't know this, Ashley, but Alex lives in my childhood home.
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:02.940]   Where I did not play video games.
[02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:05.140]   We're a little small world noments.
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:07.460]   Oh, that's wild.
[02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:08.460]   Isn't that wild?
[02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:10.260]   In Rhode Island of all places.
[02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:11.260]   Yeah.
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:12.860]   I can't believe it.
[02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:16.860]   It's a long story, but everybody at Twitt knows it, so I won't repeat it.
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:21.580]   Yeah, but I'm going to say, like, you know, it was weird to wake up on Father's Day for
[02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:23.820]   the first time in my life and have it be about me.
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:24.820]   Is it about you?
[02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:25.820]   Yeah.
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:26.820]   You know?
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:27.820]   Like, yeah, I was strange.
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:31.820]   But I will say, my kiddo is the most beautiful and amazing thing in the entire world.
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:34.380]   So, of course, yeah.
[02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:36.300]   It was a surprisingly lovely day.
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.300]   Yeah.
[02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:38.300]   It is very cute.
[02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:41.700]   Like, oh, dude, Ashley, you don't even go.
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:43.700]   Oh, I got it.
[02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:46.460]   I gladly now follow you on Twitter.
[02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:49.220]   And so I await the barrage.
[02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:55.620]   If I'll find you on signal or some other place, discord, whatever, I await the barrage of adorable
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:56.620]   baby photos.
[02:43:56.620 --> 02:43:59.940]   Oh, chunky and hilarious.
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:02.100]   And yeah, I just heard you.
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:09.100]   Did you concern about putting pictures of your kids online?
[02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:13.900]   As mine has been getting older, he wants to see them, like, after I take them.
[02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:20.260]   And so I have slowed down quite a bit on posting more recent pictures of him.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:25.100]   I mean, if I take a real banger of a portrait, like that I don't ever want to post anything
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:28.900]   that would make him feel embarrassed if he saw it in five years.
[02:44:28.900 --> 02:44:29.900]   Yeah.
[02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:30.900]   So that's, I think that's my role.
[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:32.660]   It's not a security issue.
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:33.660]   You just don't want to.
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:34.660]   Yeah.
[02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:35.660]   Yeah.
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:36.660]   I don't want to, I don't want him to feel embarrassed.
[02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:40.220]   And I also just, you know, it's like, it's not a security, so much security.
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:44.340]   I don't post a lot of pictures of him, but like, I talk about him a lot.
[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:45.340]   So yeah.
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:46.340]   Yeah.
[02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:48.060]   So we just don't show her face.
[02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:50.700]   Like, I think after like she was a week old, we just stopped.
[02:44:50.700 --> 02:44:53.940]   So like, I just pulled this up and like the last photo of her on Twitter is the back of
[02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:55.740]   her head in her room.
[02:44:55.740 --> 02:44:59.020]   And then there's a picture of me feeding her, but I put a little emoji on her face.
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:02.740]   Like, it's, it's, everyone's own choices are fine.
[02:45:02.740 --> 02:45:04.300]   But like my view is it's her body.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.300]   It's her privacy.
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:10.980]   And we don't know, we don't know, you know, 10 years from now when that picture will still
[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:15.940]   be on the internet, what kinds of things government and industry can do with it.
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:19.860]   So I, you know, it's probably, I think with like deep fakes and AI, I mean, it's just,
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:21.580]   there's a lot of things like that.
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:25.460]   So I have slowed down pretty significantly on it.
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:26.460]   Yeah.
[02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:27.460]   Yeah.
[02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:28.460]   Yeah.
[02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:31.940]   On Twitter, although it's just handle is currently Alex tired.
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:39.340]   It's because it's because I don't mean to break new ground here, but I'm tired.
