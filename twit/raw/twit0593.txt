[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   It's time for Twet this week at Tech. We've got a great panel for you.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.240]   Steven Levy from Back Channel and Wired magazine.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.800]   Georgia Dow from I'more.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.340]   And Steve Kovac from Business Insider. We're going to talk about the week's
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.080]   Tech News, a big tech summit at Trump Tower.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.520]   And why everybody looks so sour. Steve actually was in the lobby waiting for them to come out.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.060]   What's going on at Google? Nobody knows better than Steven Levy.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.520]   And Georgia Dow will explain why fake news appears to
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960]   your lizard mind. It's all coming up next on Twet.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.320]   [music]

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.420]   It's time for Twet this week in Tech, the show where we cover the week's Tech News.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.420]   And I guess this episode will be covering the years Tech News 2 because it's our last show,
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.420]   Normal Show of 2016. Next week we'll be doing a holiday episode with Steve Gibson, Denise Howell,
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.420]   and Renee Ritchie. It'll be a look back at 2016, the top big stories that we talked about in 2016.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.420]   Everything from the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to...
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420]   [music]
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.420]   Wow.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.420]   Was that me making that sound?
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.420]   To why your computer makes strange sounds.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.420]   Actually, this is the... I'm using my new computer for 2017 already.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.420]   This is the very nice Surface Studio from Microsoft.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.420]   I'm going to say the computer of the year 2017.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.420]   The following week we'll do a best of, the January 1st episode, the new years.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.420]   So Christmas Day will be the kind of the roundup and the New Year's Day will be the best.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.420]   So it's the all new podcast, but I won't have to sit and seat those days.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   So we're going to go off and do some holiday things.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.420]   Meanwhile, for the last show, I thought it'd be fun to bring in some of my favorite people,
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.420]   starting with somebody we haven't seen in a long, long time.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.420]   Stephen Kovac is here from New York still, yes?
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.420]   It's still New York.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.420]   Senior correspondent to Business Insider.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.420]   Great to see you and your cat.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   He's sitting here next to me.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.420]   I know.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.420]   Aww, that's nice.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.420]   Welcome. I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.420]   I think it's...
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.420]   Here's Larry.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.420]   Hi, Larry.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.420]   Hi, Larry.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.420]   Hi, Larry.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420]   Yeah, it's been, I think, I was on in October, maybe.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420]   Yeah, welcome back.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.420]   It's nice to be back.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.420]   Good to be back.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.860]   Also joining us from back channel, Stephen Levy is here, one of the great tech journalists
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.420]   of all time, Stephen Levy.com.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.420]   He's got a lovely Christmas tree behind him.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.420]   Very festive.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.420]   Hi, Stephen.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.420]   Good to have you.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.420]   Yep.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.420]   Good to be here.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.420]   From Montreal, Canada.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.420]   It's Georgia Dow of iMOR.com.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.420]   Hi, Georgia.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.420]   Hey.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.420]   Thanks for having me again.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.420]   You're in the white, white room today.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420]   I'm in the white room, you know, padded.
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.260]   Johnny I've padded cell.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.100]   You are not in the room where it happens, however, this week.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.540]   On Wednesday, neither was Jack Dorsey, though, so don't feel too bad.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.700]   On Wednesday, President-elect Trump met with the tech titans.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.180]   Everybody above the billionaire line, except Jack Dorsey, in Trump Tower.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.620]   And I love the pictures of Tim Cook, who went along with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.300]   There was some debate over whether these guys should go.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.900]   Cheryl Sandberg, Safra Katz of Oracle, or whether they should stay at home.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.660]   Mark Benioff seems to have stayed at home.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.300]   Travis Kalanick of Uber, stayed at home, Brian Chesky of Airbnb did not go.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.620]   Jack Dorsey was not invited because it turned out, and I didn't believe this.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.580]   I thought this is fake news for sure until it was confirmed by the Trump campaign that
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:20.780]   Twitter had refused to make a custom emoticon for crooked Hillary.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.340]   And that apparently that failed emoji deal was enough to keep Jack Dorsey from getting
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.860]   an invite.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.500]   Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.460]   So I guess the question, and Kara Switchers is going to be on in a couple of weeks because
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.660]   I'm going to ask her, she said, "You should absolutely not go."
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:49.500]   She interviewed Chris Saka, who said it was an effect endorsing fascism.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   I disagree.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.180]   I think it was probably a good thing to go.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.940]   But it didn't mean you had to smile.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.940]   There's Tim Cook not smiling.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.940]   I don't think anyone's smiled.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.620]   I think Jeff Bezos was kind of valuable.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.140]   So was this a bad idea to go or was it a good idea to go?
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.660]   I'll tell you what, I was there, not in the room, but I was...
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.420]   You were at the tower standing there on Fifth Avenue?
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.260]   I was in the lobby with the press scrum waiting for a chance to maybe have one of the executives
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.860]   come by and talk to us.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.300]   I got the impression they did not want to be there.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.540]   Many of them swooped through the lobby and didn't even...
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.540]   I missed them.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.220]   I never saw Tim Cook.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.060]   He had some stealthy ninja skills or something and he got on that elevator before anyone
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.380]   could catch him, same with Bezos and same with Musk and Satya Nadella just whisked through.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.620]   See I said before this happened, the thing to look at is what they say and how they act
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.620]   afterwards.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.060]   That's when you know if they got spanked, if they got to say something, it's interesting
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.300]   they suck out of there pretty much.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.740]   Nadella literally ran when the meeting was over.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.740]   He ran!
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.740]   Maybe he was late for a plane.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.740]   It was really funny.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.380]   I mean he has a private jet, but they didn't want to be there.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.740]   It was clear they didn't want to talk to the press about it.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.620]   A lot of times when people meet with Trump they'll come and talk to the scrum and say
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.780]   it was a great meeting and some platitudes about that and there was none of that.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.580]   They were in and out all of them and a lot of them came in through a different entrance
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.540]   so they could sneak on the elevators easier.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.900]   It was an interesting day standing in Trump Tower for six hours.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.220]   For no apparent purpose.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.540]   Most of them were Clinton supporters during the campaign, but I would guess that their
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.260]   chief interest was not making this a media opportunity for Trump.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.500]   They had cameras in the room and stuff.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.540]   They had cameras in the room for the first couple of minutes.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.980]   I think, yeah, go.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.500]   The protest I would like to see them lodge is the protest against saying that the meeting
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.540]   was going to be off the record, which of course it was in Cara.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:16.540]   I think the protest would have been saying, yeah, I'm not going to hide this from the
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.540]   public.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:28.540]   We're not going to be collaborating in secret to do something behind the public's back.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.740]   We're going to talk about what happened in there.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.980]   This is the people's business.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.620]   If you're going to be talking about what the direction of the Trump administration is
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:45.380]   in the most important industry in this country, maybe the people need to know about this.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:52.620]   To me, the two big things coming out of it were that they weren't talking that whatever
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.820]   it was, and that Trump's kids were in the room.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.260]   Four seats went to the family.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.580]   Which to me is actually, we've seen this before, but it's a shocking circumstance to
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.580]   me.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.220]   When you have a meeting like this, you have these four people.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.700]   Maybe Jared Kushner, he's a consiglier, unofficially there.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.780]   But to have your other kids in the room, there's no security clearance.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.300]   There's no official point in the transition for them.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:35.140]   It's just basically what you see in countries that aren't democracies with stuff like this.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.260]   I think that's disappointing, and I can't imagine that the big brains in the room were
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.780]   impressed by that.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.740]   It's not unprecedented for a president to use his family.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.100]   In some degree, Hillary Clinton worked on health reform for Bill Clinton.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.940]   She wasn't sitting in the meetings.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.820]   And to be honest, if she were in one of the meetings, it could be more easily justified.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:10.020]   She distinguished the person in her own right, who achieved quite a lot without having been
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.940]   inheriting the business she was involved in.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.940]   Here are some of the quotes.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.180]   It also shows such a huge conflict of interest as they're still running his businesses.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.980]   And then they're also sitting in on meetings that could influence the way that people
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.220]   are going to be doing business with them.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.900]   As Ivanka Trump said in with the Prime Minister of Japan earlier, these are some quotes from
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.260]   Cara's sources.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.500]   One source, she said, said the meeting was weird, but not as awkward as it could have
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   been.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.580]   Another said, Trump was reasonable and fair the whole time.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.580]   Clearly one of the reasons, several reasons why the CEOs go.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.940]   One is, of course, the president elect asks you, you go.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.940]   But there's also the carrot of repatriating.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.980]   I would love to see the math for how many billions of dollars are offshore dollars are
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.500]   represented by these CEOs.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.220]   Apple alone is many.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.220]   What is it?
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.300]   18 billion more than that.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:17.180]   And Trump has promised repatriation of that money for a lowered tax rate.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.820]   That's one of the things they'd like.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.460]   Satya Nadella asked for a better H1B visa situation.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.380]   It's something Trump's been inconsistent on.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:32.340]   On the one hand, acknowledging that they're often misused, bringing in less skilled tech
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.100]   employees to replace American tech workers.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.180]   But of course, Silicon Valley argues, but no, we need to bring in the smart ones.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:50.820]   The H1B visas are for the most educated workers that we can't get here in the United States.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:58.100]   Elon Musk apparently brought up climate change or at least did in another meeting.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.500]   There was some head shaking about Larry Page.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.700]   Carol writes, "Here's an outlier I personally liked.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.220]   Alphabet CEO Page brought up about infrastructure spending.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:15.300]   The need to rejigger the electrical grid, something about AC current versus DC current.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.340]   But everyone I spoke to was a little confused by this.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.140]   That's what you'd expect Larry Page to come in and say, "You know, we should really
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.540]   convert this all to DC."
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.460]   No one would say to Carol, none of her sources would say who brought up the repatriation issue,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.740]   but it was brought up.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.100]   I don't see a problem with it.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:45.540]   I understand why they skipped out quickly so as to not make it a photo op.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:55.060]   But I think it was reasonable that they go and try to build a bridge.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.580]   They don't really have a general voice.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.060]   This is the administration that they're going to be having to.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.660]   Well, they could say no.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.100]   Kalanek said no, apparently.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.660]   Chesky said no.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.820]   Mark Benney off said no.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.820]   Kalanek's on his team though.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:25.900]   Well, that's interesting because Uber has been in a constant battle with local governments.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:33.620]   At first to get in the cities because taxi commissions and taxi medallion owners didn't
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.620]   want Uber in there.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.100]   Now they're fighting with the state of California and the city of San Francisco because the city
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.300]   of San Francisco says they never paid the cheap by the way, $150 autonomous vehicle
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.380]   license for those autonomous Volvo's that Uber started to drive around on Wednesday in
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.380]   San Francisco.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.460]   Uber says, "Well, you don't make people drive Teslas with autopilot pay it, so we're not
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.460]   gonna."
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.220]   No, this is an interesting pattern.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.540]   We did a story a couple of weeks ago.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.180]   We broke a story where Auto, which is the self-driving truck company.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.620]   Also owned by Uber.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:16.420]   Yeah, right before they went to Uber, maybe this helped make them attractive to Uber because
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.100]   they did a big test run in Nevada.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:25.620]   As it turns out, they didn't have the proper license or authorization to do that.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:32.180]   There was actually our reporter found some really heated correspondence going on beforehand
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.660]   where the Nevada DMV said, "You can't do this without the authorization."
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.980]   They just did it anyway.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.660]   The irony was that the regulation was actually pretty much written by one of the co-founders
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.700]   of Auto when he was at Google.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.220]   Google's lobby has got in there and essentially wrote the regulation.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.220]   Wow.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.460]   They violated it anyway.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.340]   I guess because they wrote the regulation, they knew that there was no penalty for violating
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.340]   the regulation.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:07.380]   Now, this particular fellow is the head now of the Uber's self-driving car unit.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.900]   Apparently, he likes going on and asking forgiveness rather than permission.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.780]   We're saying, "I don't care whether you forgive me or not."
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.420]   By the way, Uber bottom right after $680 million.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.100]   I could see why Travis Kalinek might want to get into the corridors of power and bypass
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.140]   this whole regulation thing.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.460]   Trump is good for them.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.460]   Trump is anti-regulation.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.460]   Right.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.460]   They very well could be.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.300]   I think we did another story saying that the Trump administration might be the best thing
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.660]   that ever happened to Uber in terms of this regulation.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.060]   That's what's really interesting about all this because even though these CEOs all were
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.900]   for the most part Clinton supporters, they stand to make some major gains.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.120]   It's hard to know what a Trump administration would look like, but I think one thing it's
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.580]   pretty apparent from so far from his cabinet picks is he's probably good for big business.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.340]   That's what these guys are run as big businesses.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.260]   Maybe there isn't this natural antipathy.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.820]   Maybe there's just some of this partisan antipathy, but it does seem like these guys could probably
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.180]   get a lot more even than repatriation from a Trump administration.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.180]   Right.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.940]   But then you see silly things like him promising they're going to start building iPhones here
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.140]   in the United States and it just untenable stuff like that.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.980]   I see he hasn't said anything about that since the, so the part of the problem is there's
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.340]   this big red line, but pre-election, post-election.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.860]   And already they've repudiated many of the things they said pre-election.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.740]   And I haven't heard anything about bringing iPhone production back to the United States.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.860]   I think what would happen pretty quickly is you'd find out that it's just not practical
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:53.180]   and it wouldn't bring jobs because all you're doing is bringing the robots back.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.180]   Right.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.260]   And they probably when it comes to jobs, which I think was like the main topic of this whole
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.020]   thing, the repatriation plays into that right.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.620]   They kind of dangle, okay, we'll give you a better tax rate when we want to repatriate
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.260]   that cash.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   But in exchange, we need to see some more jobs created here.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.940]   Now again, those aren't the kind of jobs that Trump has been promising.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.300]   They're not blue collar jobs.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.060]   They're not manufacturing jobs.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.660]   They're high skilled, highly educated jobs.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.380]   So there's just that irony there too.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.100]   Here's some more confusion.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.460]   Here's an article from November 20th, 2015.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:37.340]   Donald Trump's plan for a Muslim database in a Newton, Iowa campaign stop.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.980]   He said, I would certainly implement that.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   Absolutely.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.940]   There should be lots of systems beyond databases.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.820]   We should have a lot of systems.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:51.500]   And the Trump team a year later saying he never advocated for a Muslim database.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.780]   And now Silicon Valley tech workers planning to not build the database that Donald Trump
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.220]   either does or doesn't want.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.620]   We live in interesting times.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.620]   Do we not?
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.420]   I mean, that's all Muslim.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.540]   This whole Muslim database thing was a strange story this week because, you know, they're
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.500]   getting these tech companies are getting cheered for vowing not to do it.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.860]   When no one's asked them to.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.340]   No one's asked them to.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.700]   And they didn't start falling in line until I forget what the I think it was Twitter or
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.220]   maybe only one company major company came out and said like flat out.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.700]   No, we're not doing this when asked.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.700]   I believe.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.900]   Remember Gina Rometty of IBM wrote it.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.900]   Twitter came out.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.900]   Gina Rometty.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.420]   I am wrote a open letter to President elect Trump a couple of weeks ago pledging her support
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.420]   at the support of IBM.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:46.500]   And then of course, people immediately pointed out the IBM had made a database for the Nazis.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.340]   And so there was some clamor over that.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.460]   And then who was it?
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.460]   Was it Saffra cats?
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.220]   Was it Oracle that promised to do anything that the Trump administration wanted?
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.060]   So I think some of this is in response to that.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:05.380]   Never again.tech with the undersigned employees of tech organizations and companies, engineers,
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.660]   business executives, designers.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.980]   We commit to refuse to participate in the creation of databases.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.900]   600 people have signed.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:20.500]   It's quite a few, including most of the big companies at that table.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.220]   But it's almost, I mean, good.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.300]   I mean, right on don't.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   Now you shouldn't do that.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   Clearly that's a bad idea.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:36.340]   And it's a pledge anybody can get behind.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.420]   It feels like right now there's a lot of confusion and wheel spinning.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:46.260]   And I wonder if that I wonder what these tech executives seeing at this table really think
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:51.940]   really what they don't wouldn't it be reasonable as in most cases CEOs have publicly held publicly
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.740]   traded companies that they look to find any advantage that they can for their business.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.260]   And if you're talking to the future president of the United States, that's where you go
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.340]   to lobby for the stuff that's good for your business.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.340]   Now you're absolutely right on that.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.140]   But there's two tracks here.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.980]   There's the pure bottom line track.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.580]   And then there's the morals track, the vision track.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:22.620]   Most of these Silicon Valley CEOs believe that their companies aren't just money machines,
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.580]   but they're doing things that are good for the world.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:33.060]   And in two major areas, the Trump administration is clearly diverging from core values of these
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.620]   companies in the good for the world category.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.700]   One is diversity, which a lot of these companies, even though their employment roles may not
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.620]   reflect it, they certainly like to talk about how they're going to do better in achieving
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.660]   diversity among their ranks.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.220]   And the second is climate change.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:54.980]   And companies like Google and Facebook, even though there are software companies, they
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.340]   work very hard to prove their data centers are green.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.220]   And climate change is something they really believe in.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.460]   Apple has a head of environment.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.140]   It used to be out of the EPA.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.780]   I doubt she's going to join the Trump administration.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:18.140]   So I think there's this tension there, whereas on one hand it might be good for their bottom
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.540]   line, they didn't vote for the guy and they don't like this guy.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.860]   You know, I have to point out that at least in diversity, it's more about public relations
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.700]   than actually really doing anything.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.060]   I do think that companies are doing a lot about climate change.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.820]   Google announced this year that they're going to be 100% solar powered in 2017 for everything.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.660]   The network centers, their business operations, their office operations, 100% solar.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.940]   So I think that they're serious about that.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.540]   But somewhat it seems to be about optics more than anything else.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:22:00.060]   You know, if Twitter is worried about it, we better put out an open letter.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.060]   All right, enough.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.980]   We don't want to do too much politics.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.620]   It's just that's a big tech story.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   They're all there.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.100]   And I don't know what to say about it.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.460]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.500]   Elon Musk has now added tunnel drilling as one of his on Twitter as one of the things
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.740]   he's interested in after tweeting that he hated traffic so much he wanted to drill a
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.980]   tunnel to drive to work.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.100]   He's taking an underground hyperloop.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:34.460]   But what's interesting is when the tunnel become immediately exactly as congested as anything
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.140]   else, his Elon Musk's new bio says Tesla SpaceX tunnels.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.460]   Yes, tunnels.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.020]   And he wants to call it the boring company.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.020]   Traffic is not driving me nuts.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.820]   I'm going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.740]   I'm actually his most recent tweet.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.700]   I'm actually going to do this.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.340]   Oh my God.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.260]   I thought at first this was the the fake Elon Musk.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.580]   This is the really on Musk.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.500]   Not going to be the new status symbol, your own private tunnel tunnel.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.060]   I have a tunnel to work.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.060]   Forget helicopters.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.220]   I'm going underground.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.940]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.020]   When we come back AirPods are for sale.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.460]   Apple finally released him.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.460]   Where were they?
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.900]   What was happening?
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.860]   And are any of you getting them?
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.500]   Mine's not coming till next year.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.700]   Have them right here.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.700]   I didn't order them fast enough.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.980]   Now, are those the pre-production or the actual?
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.500]   These are the actual ones they sent me a review.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   Oh, thank you, Doug.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.780]   They're the real ones too.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.540]   Well, I'll ask you about that in a moment.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.460]   Amazon Echo is going into 4.7,000 win Las Vegas
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.700]   rooms starting in the summer.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:52.260]   And Congress moves to ban ticket scalping all coming up.

[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.820]   Of this week in text, even Kovec is here
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.860]   from Business Insider.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.220]   He's senior correspondent.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.060]   Steve.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.900]   - Very fancy title.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.740]   - Very fancy.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.140]   Stephen Levy, one of the original,
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.460]   the best computer journalist.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.300]   What is it?
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.260]   Is it the 30th anniversary now of hackers?
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.700]   - Okay.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.540]   - 32. - 32.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.940]   - It was probably 1984.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.540]   - Holy cow.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.060]   And written so many great books since then.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.620]   - John Markoff recently retired from the New York Times.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.900]   - I was just going to ask you about that.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.780]   - What's the longer the longest standing senior?
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.700]   - Well, there's a few others.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.500]   Larry Maguet, there's a few others from that era
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.340]   who are around.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.460]   But I know that I kind of dated,
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.420]   there was a one point, Microsoft did this thing
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.700]   of a hood canal, which is Bill Gates's little
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.500]   vacation complex in his family.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.300]   And they pulled together some of the reporters of that era
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.220]   to go and have a pajama party,
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.460]   which was Steve Ballmer and Bill.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.820]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.140]   - A pajama party?
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   - That's what we jokingly called it.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.540]   We went on sea planes to the hood canal,
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.180]   which looks like a lake to me,
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.900]   but apparently they called the hood canal
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.900]   to saltwater body east of Seattle.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.300]   And we spent two days, I mean, that's for two years in a row,
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.460]   talking to Steve and Bill.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.260]   They gave us a download on the company
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:52.260]   and really went deep.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.300]   And then we peeled off,
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.100]   Bill's family usually vacations there.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.500]   So a guy slept in one of Bill's sisters rooms.
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   - Wow.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   - So Markoff and I were the last working reporters
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.340]   left from that trip.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.740]   And now he's gonna still be working.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.940]   He's gonna be a historian for the computer history museum.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.780]   - I saw that.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.780]   I think that's great.
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.860]   - Yeah, but no longer a timesman.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:26.180]   You never worked in a newspaper or did you, Stephen?
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.740]   - No, not full time.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.100]   - You've always done more long form feature length
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.260]   kind of stuff in books.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.940]   - So I started writing for weekly publications and then--
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.780]   - Newsweek.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.220]   - Well, then the later Newsweek,
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.620]   and then magazines mostly.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.940]   - Yeah, wired.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.020]   And your back at Conde Nast, which is funny,
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.860]   'cause you started--
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.700]   - Rolling Stone, yeah.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.860]   - You wrote on the group right.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.700]   - Yeah, I'm going Stone too.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.980]   - I started writing about technology for Rolling Stone.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.540]   That was my first tech stories.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.100]   - No kidding.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.460]   - Yeah, the hackers was based,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.340]   started with an article about computer hackers
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.260]   at Stanford that I wrote in 1982.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.100]   - Wow.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.180]   Wow.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.380]   I salute you, sir.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.580]   And of course, all the old guys have been on this show.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.140]   (laughing)
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.940]   I don't know what that is, but...
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.500]   And I love John, and he's great.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.660]   And I'm glad he's found something he wants to do.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.940]   I think that the Computer History Museum
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.220]   will be a good place for him.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.580]   Although I hope he continues to write.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.540]   I'd love to see him writing more long form stuff.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.980]   That would be kind of cool.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.820]   - Let's see.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.860]   What other stories do we have here?
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.940]   Pebble, you wrote a good story, Stephen,
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.020]   on the end of Pebble and what happened there?
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.780]   What happened?
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.500]   - Which Stephen, who you talk to, who wrote it?
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.220]   - You both wrote that story.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.260]   - Steve, yeah, Steve, see also did a story, yeah.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.220]   - So between the two of you, what happened?
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.300]   - I'll let him go first.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.660]   - Okay.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.260]   - They didn't sell enough watches.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.900]   This basically, they were not profitable.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.900]   And when you're not making money, bad things happen.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.940]   And you outspend the money you have.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.380]   They started out, it was just a fascinating story.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.380]   I met them when they were at Y Combinator in 2011.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.420]   And they were the only hardware startup,
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.540]   I think in the bunch.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.420]   And they were probably the lowest funded company
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.460]   in that whole bunch.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.220]   And then they came out of it.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.380]   And since they didn't have much funding,
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.140]   they decided to do a Kickstarter for their first product,
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.980]   the first watch.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.820]   - Really?
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.660]   - They did great.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.500]   - Yeah.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.340]   - Yeah.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.820]   And for a couple of years, they were going well.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.820]   And then the last year, they had a bad second half,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.940]   didn't make the numbers, and never were profitable again.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.660]   And early this year, they lay people off.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.580]   Steve was able to nail down something that,
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.220]   I didn't get on the record, which was,
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.980]   they almost got bought by a company.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.140]   And this year, they tried to make it,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.260]   and they could not.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.300]   They had a couple of interesting new products
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.100]   that they did a Kickstarter on,
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.780]   because they couldn't get funding to do it the normal way.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.580]   And as the year went on, it became clear,
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.580]   there was no exit.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.020]   They went to have some wacky ideas.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.740]   They explored weird private equity companies,
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.940]   and even an idea.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.660]   They would cut down to like 10 people
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.660]   and see if they can keep going.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.100]   But the only exit would turn down to be a sale,
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.340]   and it turned out to be a fit.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.220]   - Yeah, Steve, so tell me about that,
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.340]   'cause I think people were surprised to see
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.140]   that they had at one point an offer of,
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.180]   what was it, $74 million?
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.540]   - Well, that wasn't true.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.380]   - That was not true.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.220]   - That was not true.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.980]   That was, I spent a week trying to dig into that,
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.860]   and it seemed really funny that someone told TechCrunch
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.780]   that there was a $740 million off from the table
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.180]   from Citizen, the Japanese watchmaker.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.700]   That just didn't make sense.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.580]   You look at Citizen's market cap,
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.540]   it's not that much, that's almost half
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.100]   a Citizen's market cap.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.940]   So why would they spend that on?
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.940]   So I heard that that was someone disgruntled,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.220]   like literally lying to the press.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.740]   - Why'd they stop at 74?
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.660]   Although that's kind of--
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.740]   - Oh, no, 740 million.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.820]   - 740, oh.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.980]   - So I mean, that's just insane.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.940]   And so, you know, first it's kind of like--
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.780]   - Okay.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.860]   - Oh man, how could they turn down that acquisition?
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.380]   You know, that would have been at such a nice exit for them.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.380]   They would have had this cushion of, you know,
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.580]   a traditional watchmaker, which we've seen, you know,
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.500]   like fossil buy, you know, smart watchmaker.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.660]   - Well, that almost makes sense,
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.260]   because the traditional watchmakers don't they wanna
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.180]   find new markets, I mean, watch sales have to be down
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.500]   overall.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.340]   - Right, but it turns out that's not what happened.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.500]   So the Citizen thing was, there was actually a collaboration
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.060]   between the two companies, Pebble-Paid Citizen,
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.420]   about 50 grand to help them design the round,
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.900]   which is that circular watch that launched,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.220]   I don't know, like a year ago or so.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.980]   It turned out they ended up not using Citizen's design.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.140]   Citizen submitted like 10 designs.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.180]   Pebble found them a little too thick and chunky.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.740]   They were really looking for something slimmer,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.980]   and they went internally with their own design.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.580]   And literally that, you know, was the end
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.180]   of the relationship with Citizen.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.740]   There was no offer, there was no acquisition talks.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.580]   Maybe internally Citizen discussed it or something,
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.340]   but there's certainly nothing formal
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.180]   and there definitely wasn't anything for 740 million.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.820]   - Thank you for doing the legwork and debunking that,
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.180]   'cause I think it really made the rounds.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.820]   Everybody kind of, I repeated that number.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.180]   - Yeah, and then it became this thing like,
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.140]   oh, what a fool and then made Eric Majakowski,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.180]   the CEO look like an idiot for, which is not.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.340]   So the real acquisition that fell through was the Intel one
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.860]   in late spring-ish of this year.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.380]   And that was for approximately 70 million.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.300]   There's a little debate internally
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.020]   at the company why that fell through.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.180]   Intel ultimately withdrew and the offer was higher
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.300]   than 70 million, then they went down to 70 million.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.060]   So it's unclear who exactly said no.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.580]   Some people think Eric was trying to get more than 70.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   Some people say no, it's just,
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.340]   kind of a he said, she said situation,
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.180]   but once that deal fell through,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:32.540]   everyone at the company knew things were on the way out
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.420]   and the employees were even offered a chance saying,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.220]   "Hey, we know things look bad.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.100]   "You guys can leave now.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.820]   "We'll give you a severance package."
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.100]   Or if you guys wanna stay on and try to see this thing
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.980]   through to the end, we'll double your shares in the company.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.740]   And some people left, but a lot of people did stay on
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.220]   and hoping those new products like the Core
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.580]   and the Time 2 would kind of reinvigorate interest
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.140]   in the company, but ultimately that just didn't happen.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.540]   - The Core was kind of interesting.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.860]   The idea was you have Amazon Echo kind of built
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.420]   into a little worry weed in your pocket.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.420]   - Yeah, I wish that thing actually came out.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.300]   - A lot of people wish that they're gonna refund your money.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.460]   But what's, I think one of the reasons
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.100]   is an interesting story and people assumed
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.380]   that Pebble was doing better than they were,
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.180]   is that they did such a good job
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.620]   of raising money on Kickstarter with three separate campaigns,
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.100]   raising many millions of dollars.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.220]   They were the first kind of breakout Kickstarter campaign.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.180]   - Yeah, but when you look at that money,
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.260]   even if it's like $12 million was the latest one,
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.340]   really to be successful, they have to sell
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.500]   through their channels, Best Buy and other places,
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.340]   like that.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.140]   So you really get your table money, table stakes
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.340]   from starting on there and getting some money in advance.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.980]   But the real money comes when you really build out
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.380]   the channels to many millions of people.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.140]   I think they had 24,000 buyers for the Pebble Core
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.820]   and that's a product that if it's successful,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.980]   would have had a million buyers.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.020]   - Yeah, I think maybe in some ways
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.540]   that's the problem with being a success on Kickstarter.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.900]   It seems like a lot and it's really not.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.740]   It's--
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.660]   - It's a pre-order.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.140]   - It's a pre-order.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.540]   - Well, I think that from an emotional standpoint,
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.500]   people are sad to see Pebble go.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.940]   It was one of the first smart watches
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.660]   that were hitting the ground running.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.700]   And I think that everyone that I know have,
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.620]   well, everyone, all of my tech friends have a Pebble.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.340]   And so it's really sad, but in the end,
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.580]   it's survival of the fittest.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.260]   And they just couldn't keep their momentum going with it.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.300]   - Well, and here's the real question.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.860]   People combined this with the announcement by Motorola,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.980]   they're not gonna work on any more 360 Android wear watches
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.500]   for at least for the time being.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.180]   And looked at sales of the Apple Watch,
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.460]   whether you believe IDC or you believe Tim Cook,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.820]   they maybe don't look like a significant amount.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.180]   Fitbit is the only one that seems to be doing well
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.460]   in the market and it's mostly selling low-end,
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.860]   inexpensive pedometer-style fitness devices.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.580]   - And it's stock is way down.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.980]   I mean, basically--
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.820]   - And it's not doing well.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820]   - Is this category dead?
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.940]   - So when I talked to Eric and he was nice enough
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.060]   to sit down with me because mainly,
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.260]   I like the company, I've been following them
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.500]   pretty closely over the last couple of years.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.660]   We even had a series that we called Adventures of Pebble
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.740]   where every couple of times a year I would check in
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.380]   when they had something new and we'd write about it early.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.820]   And he told me that his big mistake, he thought,
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.900]   was not seeing early on.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.900]   That it really was all about fitness for these things.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.260]   That was the number one thing that people wanted to do
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.460]   with these wrist wearables,
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.620]   they wouldn't even call it a watch.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   And the last group of products had increased
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:57.780]   fitness features, they had a heartbeat monitor,
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.620]   they all had GPS that worked offline.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.100]   So he was hoping that that would align them
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.420]   for what people are using it.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:09.420]   But in general, the transition from watch to smartwatch
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.780]   has not been gangbusters.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.780]   And Apple's professors to be happy with what they're doing,
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.820]   but if you look at what they've done,
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.580]   they've doubled down on fitness
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.220]   and they don't talk about it as a fashion item anymore.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.380]   - Right, they eliminated the gold,
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.020]   a very expensive gold one.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.740]   - Yeah, your gold watch now is now obsolete,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.620]   which you could probably know if you gave about 10 minutes
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.700]   thought before you sprung $24,000 for it.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.020]   - Well, I guess anybody with that kind of money to spend
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.340]   probably didn't care.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.980]   - They weren't really caring whether the Thera,
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.260]   watch is gonna be obsolete enough.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.780]   If you can shell out that much money
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.980]   for a smartwatch of the first gen,
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.500]   then you can probably afford to get another one when they want.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.380]   I think that the problem when people talk about
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.900]   our wearables dad because of the prices,
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.300]   like the thing with it is you cannot compare them the same
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.060]   to a laptop or a phone.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.540]   Odds are if you're gonna get a smartwatch,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.420]   you're gonna buy one.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.180]   And that's gonna be good for many years,
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.140]   you're not gonna be upgrading it every single year.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.620]   So if they did sell over 12 million year one,
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.900]   that's a lot of wearable smartmosh
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.620]   that Apple has sold and then you're not gonna upgrade it.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.220]   So this is something that you have
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.660]   and it's good and you're still using it.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.620]   So most of the people that were really interested
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.300]   and wanted to get on board right away
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.020]   have already bought one and they're probably not gonna be
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.660]   upgrading for three or four years.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.580]   And so only then will we be able to see it.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.100]   I think that when watches become more autonomous
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.340]   and you're able to use them without your phone,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.100]   that's when we're gonna see a huge spring in wearables
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.980]   because Fitbit is always gonna take the low end marker
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.820]   for something that's gonna be cheap, easy
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.220]   and just deal with fitness.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.260]   Whereas Apple's gonna take that high end market
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.340]   where you're gonna be able to replace it eventually
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.460]   for your phone.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.860]   - Steve, you wrote a couple weeks ago.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.780]   - I totally disagree with that.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.460]   - Wearables are dead.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.780]   - Yeah, I totally disagree with that.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.820]   I mean, they were pitching this thing
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.500]   and all smartwatches as a new kind of computing platform.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.860]   I mean, from the very beginning,
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.700]   the Apple watch was pitched as,
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.860]   you know, it decreases your reliance on the phone
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.340]   and you're gonna be able to do just about everything
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.460]   on your wrist versus, you know, on your phone.
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.620]   But that just doesn't make sense.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.380]   I mean, you look at, you know,
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:19.020]   so many of the original applications for this Apple watch
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.620]   were just like shrunken down versions
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.180]   of what you see on your smartphone.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.760]   Like no one wants to squint down
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.140]   with extergrand photos.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.380]   - Unusable, unusable, shrunken down versions.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.980]   - Slowness aside, let's pretend it was super fast, okay?
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.820]   - Yeah.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.980]   - You don't want to squint at Instagrams or tweets
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.100]   or headlines from New York Times on your wrist.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.740]   - Plus the inscrutable UI, I mean.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.780]   - Yeah.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.620]   And they fix that.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.700]   A lot of that's been fixed now.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.060]   The UI issues, I mean, it's better.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.300]   But it's better as a passive device as a fitness tracker,
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.020]   heartbeat, heart rate monitor, you know,
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.380]   maybe notifications and of course time.
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.180]   But then again, do you really need to spend
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.260]   between three and 500 bucks for that?
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.100]   No.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.740]   Not just, by the way, it's not just fitness
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.740]   'cause it's really casual fitness.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.500]   Because if you're a runner, a serious fitness buff,
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.540]   you're gonna get a serious runner's watch
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.620]   and it's not gonna be one of these.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.140]   It's gonna be from Garmin or Polar.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.860]   It's gonna be a much more serious device.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.380]   And I don't think these middle ground devices
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.180]   really aid into that market particularly.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.740]   So it's for casual fitness users.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.580]   That's a fairly small market.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.860]   - Well, Apple once again, I mean, you know,
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.180]   they really took a lot of care
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.060]   to make sure you could swim with a watch.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.780]   Which is not the first thing I wanna do
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.620]   when I buy a watch, but, you know,
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.820]   'cause they have this amazing thing
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.820]   and it's like shows how an Apple wants to be fanatical
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.740]   about something, it does it, is, you know,
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.700]   one of the big features of the watch is
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.420]   that you can swim in it and then, you know,
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.580]   when you turn that part on, you know,
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.500]   can spin it all through the water out.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.780]   - It spits the water out.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.580]   Yeah, which is kind of amazing, right?
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.020]   - Amazing, slightly ineffective, but amazing.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.860]   - It's amazing, but it's not $350 amazing.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.500]   - No, but it's like over the top, right?
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.340]   - Yeah.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.420]   - I think that what we're missing is that
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.140]   it's not just for health, but I think that one
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.540]   of the biggest features for the Apple watch
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.660]   that's often overlooked is for safety.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.940]   I think that the SOS safe feature,
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.620]   especially if you're dealing with someone
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.140]   that you don't know if they might fall down
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.980]   or get hurt and be able to, is absolutely amazing.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.300]   You're saving $40 a month just in that.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.820]   So it saves you money if you were gonna plan
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.340]   on buying your parent something that's gonna be able
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.980]   to track them and they're gonna be able to call out
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.060]   for safety for that.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.780]   And so the SOS feature in itself is gonna save you money
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.140]   within year one.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.100]   And so that's why I think that it's gonna be one
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.060]   of these devices that yeah, it's new, it's out,
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.140]   they're getting their grounding.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.180]   Definitely Steve, I think that you're absolutely right.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.220]   I think that there's a certain amount
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.260]   of expectation debt for people that thought
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.140]   that this would replace your phone.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   No, I think that anyone that would have thought that though
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.420]   wasn't really thinking about the small interface
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.660]   and the way that they could use it.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.780]   And they're gonna be able to have to get their feet grip
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.820]   to be able to see what exactly, how do we use our watch
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.460]   and what will be useful versus not.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.860]   I think the scribble feature has made messaging so much easier
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.820]   and the dictation is much better than it was before.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.580]   But it's, again, this is a first gen product
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.140]   so you can only expect so much to it now second gen.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.980]   - It's interesting that Apple's strategy here
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.060]   has been to find a hundred different little things
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.720]   like that, emergency button like swimming.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.460]   - The breathe app. - The breathe app,
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.300]   which are all niches and it almost feels like
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.460]   they're trying to cobble together enough niche products
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.900]   to make one whole product.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.940]   And I think the fundamental problem with the Pebble,
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.860]   with the Apple Watch or the Android Wear watches
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.740]   is face it, you don't really need it.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.860]   And I wonder if we're entering it,
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.140]   it's not that we're, maybe are we in economic hard times?
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.140]   I can't, I never know.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.660]   It seems like we are and we aren't, I don't know.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.660]   The job numbers are good
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.740]   but Donald Trump says everything's crap.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.420]   So somewhere there's some, I don't know what's going on
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.300]   but I feel like when you are in hard times
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.780]   or if at least people psychologically are reluctant
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.980]   to spend discretionary money that a watch
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.300]   is the easy thing to say, well, I'm not gonna buy that.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.460]   That's the one where you can just say,
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.180]   yeah, I don't think I'll spend money on that.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.620]   Apple's managed to stay alive in this market
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.380]   but it feels like they're hanging on by their fingernails.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.500]   And when you see Pebble and Motorola
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.540]   and ultimately even Fitbit struggling.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.380]   - And Google.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.980]   - And Google, I mean they made it.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.420]   - The straight word, it's just like, yeah.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.420]   What's going on there?
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.540]   It's they did the latest and their partners
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.780]   are just kind of abandoning the platform.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.140]   - Nobody needs it.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:35.980]   - Oh.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.020]   - And of course, if anybody's gonna sell something
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.620]   nobody needs, Apple's probably the best person to do it
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.300]   because they're just brilliant marketers.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.100]   They're brilliant at creating an aura and a mystique around it.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.700]   But that's not gonna be enough in the long run
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.540]   to save the category.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.340]   So I think, you know what?
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.180]   I'm gonna have to rule in your favor, Steve Kovac.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.020]   I think we'll--
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.820]   - Yes, we'll see in two years.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.220]   - I said, I said,
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.060]   - Who's doing it in Apple Watch now?
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.100]   - Two years to find out, is the Apple Watch still alive?
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:01.940]   - I own an edition.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.420]   - My vote is it will be.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.700]   - I own an edition.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.540]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.940]   I was in Vegas.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.460]   Yeah, there you go, Georgia.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.140]   I was in Vegas and a lot of people in Vegas,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.020]   a lot of Chinese people in Vegas were wearing Apple watches.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.540]   So I think this is where Apple's so good at,
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.340]   Apple's become, I think, a fashion brand.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.660]   And so when you're selling a fashion product,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.980]   status and look, and that becomes more important
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.100]   than functionality.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.740]   So in the rest of the world,
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.620]   where when it comes to spending an extra 350 bucks,
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.220]   you can easily forego buying the fitness watch
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.260]   or the smart watch,
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.340]   you're gonna, that business is gonna die.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.300]   That business is gonna tank.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.780]   And Apple's, unfortunately, Apple doesn't release numbers.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.860]   So we don't, you know, Apple could say it's the best,
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.380]   we had the, as Tim Cook did,
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.740]   the best weekend we've ever had for the Apple Watch
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.980]   is meaningless.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.180]   That means what they sold a few.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.020]   I don't know what that means, but.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.220]   See, I don't know if it's so much of a fashion brand
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.060]   'cause I don't know.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:00.900]   It's a fashion brand.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.380]   I don't really find the watch that beautiful.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.340]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.180]   It's an ugly fashion.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.900]   I do think that it's a status.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.180]   I think that it's a status symbol definitely.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.820]   I noticed when other people are watching
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.380]   and wearing an Apple watch.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.380]   It also shows their level of technology
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.100]   that they enjoy, which, you know, I like,
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.340]   but I don't know.
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.300]   I think that for fashion in and of itself,
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.940]   I think that the watch kind of ends up a little bit short.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.940]   Ben Thompson on Stretecory had a good article last month
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.060]   on niche strategies.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:32.900]   Oh, that was awesome.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.820]   Yeah, like things like the Surface Studio,
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.420]   which I'm using right now, the Nintendo Switch.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.740]   These are, he even says,
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.580]   "The PC market in general is in some respects,
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.460]   a niche product."
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.340]   He says, "For most people,
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.340]   particularly outside the US,
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.140]   a smartphone is all they need or care to buy.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.060]   The world today is the exact opposite
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.300]   of the world a mere decade ago,
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.780]   where we bought dedicated devices
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.060]   to plug into our digital hub PCs.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.100]   The smartphone and cloud is now the hub.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.820]   Everything else is optional."
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:07.220]   And I think that that's kind of what we're seeing.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.580]   It's too bad though.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.660]   I think Pebble, you know, Pebble was a nice story.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.880]   What's gonna happen?
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.300]   Fitbit's gonna acquire them.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.100]   Will they keep many of the employees?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.020]   Are they gonna go?
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.620]   What's gonna happen to what's left of Pebble?
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.460]   It sounds like they're--
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.300]   It sounds like they're--
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.140]   Half.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.340]   The software's people.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:32.020]   So that they can put it into a Fitbit.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.460]   Yeah, the question is, I guess,
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:38.500]   how much of the Pebble iOS morphs into
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.780]   what will be the Fitbit iOS?
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.420]   Eric indicated to me that
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:48.020]   one thing he tried to do in that deal
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.820]   was to give some sort of bridge for developers.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.940]   So the work that they would--
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:57.940]   They have done on Pebble might still live on in some way
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:01.540]   and they'd be able to write in the future
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.580]   to the platform that takes over
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:10.020]   some of the ideas of not the code of the Pebble iOS.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.260]   - Mijikovsky seems like a good guy.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.540]   - Oh, he's super nice.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.340]   - What happens to him? - What happens to him?
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.980]   - Why combinator?
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.660]   Oh yeah, you said that, right?
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:20.940]   So he's gonna mentor.
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.860]   - I think so.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.540]   - He seems to be the end of the line.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.540]   - That's the end of the line for the entrepreneur, right?
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.900]   All right, I'm done starting companies.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.420]   I'll go be an angel investor and a mentor.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.260]   - He's a young guy.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.740]   - I think he's 30 years old.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.020]   You know, what a story.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.420]   - It's an amazing story.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.420]   - He started the company.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.020]   So this is the first time in his adult life
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.580]   that he's not running a company.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.860]   I think my guess is eventually
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.100]   he will be running another company.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.020]   He's gonna look for his next thing.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.740]   - For sure. - Yeah.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:52.940]   - Yeah, well, I hope so.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.580]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.060]   I wanna talk about magic leap and what's going on there?
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.460]   I'm curious what you all think.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.660]   'Cause I'm not sure what to think.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.500]   I mean, on the one hand,
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.980]   it looks like it might be the next Theranos.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.820]   On the other hand,
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.100]   maybe it's just a hard thing to solve.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.420]   I bet Stephen Levy has some thoughts on that.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.940]   First though, a word from Squarespace.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.500]   That's where I make my website, my home on the web.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.860]   And I think a lot of you are already,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.380]   but if you're not, if you're looking for somewhere,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.140]   let me tell you Squarespace is the simplest,
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.180]   the best way to create a beautiful website,
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.380]   whether you're a designer.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.500]   And of course, if you're a designer,
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.740]   aesthetics are paramount, a photographer.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.940]   You gotta have aesthetics and functionality, right?
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.060]   A filmmaker, a writer, a musician, a freelancer, a blogger.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.660]   If you sell online for all of you,
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.500]   Squarespace is the place to make your next website.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.300]   It's the best hosting tied with the best software.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.700]   It's a great content management system.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.340]   You start with the Squarespace templates,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.180]   beautifully designed and beautifully engineered.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.300]   You see the design,
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.020]   but under the hood, incredible engineering
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.920]   that gives every Squarespace site
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.020]   the modern features that you need on your website,
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.900]   things like mobile responsive design.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.420]   So one site fits any size screen.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.700]   In this day and age, that's what you need.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.980]   You don't need a separate mobile site.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.340]   You need a site that looks good no matter
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.420]   what size screen your visitors are using.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.060]   And every site has e-commerce built in.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.760]   And I've venture to say it's the only web hosting,
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.420]   web software that gives you e-commerce
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.020]   that looks every bit as good as your site,
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.860]   'cause it is.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.700]   It's the same design, the same template.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.620]   It's not some afterthought hanging off your site.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.180]   It is your site.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.780]   And all of the features,
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.340]   they have an amazing commerce platform.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.580]   You'll definitely wanna check that out.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.580]   Squarespace is also very fast, reliable,
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.340]   hosting with an amazing uptime record.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.860]   You just, you cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.220]   You get a free custom domain name
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.060]   with an annual purchase,
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.860]   by the way they do now sell domain names
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.820]   with over 200 top level domains.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.300]   So you can get your domain name right from Squarespace.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.340]   One of the advantages of that is you'll get a,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.000]   if you're not ready to design the site yet,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.900]   when you buy the domain at Squarespace,
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.620]   you get a beautiful parking page
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.260]   with Squarespace's style and template.
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.940]   So it doesn't look like it's one of those janky parking pages,
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.140]   other than those other guys offer you.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.380]   It really looks nice.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.140]   Squarespace members who have built or contributed
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.740]   three or more active websites websites.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.100]   And then by the way, that's a lot of them,
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.380]   'cause once you do it once, you wanna do it again and again.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.380]   There's even a lot of people who've made a living designing
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.220]   and selling Squarespace sites.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.140]   You'll get access to Squarespace Circle.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.940]   Circle membership includes advanced guides,
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.540]   optimized support, six month trial periods
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.460]   for new projects and more.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.940]   But all of you can try it for free regardless.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.300]   Just go to squarespace.com,
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.660]   click the Get Started button and play with it.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.660]   You'll see how it's great.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.860]   They've got a new magazine style templates
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.460]   with grid style landing pages,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.540]   infinite scroll related posts, the author profile,
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.100]   the integrated search field.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.900]   I'm a big fan.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.540]   It's where I host my sites where we host our inside Twitch site.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.660]   You're gonna like at squarespace.com.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.780]   If you have to try it, you decide to buy,
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.780]   use the offer code TWIT and you'll get 10% off squarespace.com.

[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.900]   We're talking the week's tech news.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.180]   Georgia Dow is here from iMore.com.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.180]   The lone Apple Watch Defender.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.100]   I've got my watch edition.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.500]   I love it, it's beautiful.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:24.620]   I wore it a lot, but it is a little thick and clunky and big.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.620]   And I-- - It's a little bit thick.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.460]   - The thing about it, it has that trait
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.060]   where if you leave it behind, you don't go,
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.300]   oh, I gotta go back and get it.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.620]   You can live it out. - You see,
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.500]   I feel differently after where,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:38.260]   this, like, so since I use the 7 Plus, it's huge.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.340]   And so I can leave my phone in my purse.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.420]   I don't have to worry about missing anything
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.700]   because I'm a psychotherapist.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.940]   I'm in session the entire time.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.460]   If someone has an emergency,
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.220]   they're able to reach me in between session and--
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.780]   - So that's another one of those niches.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.580]   Like nurses, psychotherapist doctors,
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.340]   they like the notification feature.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.460]   - Definitely, definitely at the beginning
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.700]   because it's just not a device that can work
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.340]   on its own as of yet.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.780]   But that's the beginning of it, right?
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.620]   And eventually that's what it's gonna end up being
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.820]   is a device that you can use on the run
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.860]   when you wanna be able to travel light.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.700]   It's never gonna be able to replace a laptop or your phone.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.540]   And if you're expecting that,
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.900]   I think that you'll be very sorely upset.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.620]   But it will be something that eventually
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.700]   you're gonna be able to use and go out
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.300]   when you're running or, you know,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.340]   dealing with something or exercising or what.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.220]   And you don't have to carry your phone with you
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.460]   because everyone hates having to carry their phone
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.820]   in their pocket or in their purse.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.580]   They're heavy, they're large, they're clunky.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.100]   You end up with that bonus of the real estate,
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.500]   but then you end up with that weight
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.580]   and carrying in that extra luggage that you may not want.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.780]   And in the end, all of our smart devices
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.700]   are gonna be something that's small and easy and wearable.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.140]   It's just we haven't gotten the math right yet.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.540]   And of course that's gonna take a story.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.980]   - That's why we needed the Pebble Corps.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.820]   - I know.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   - Oh, I'm sorry, yeah, I hear you.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:50.660]   - I know.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.060]   - I hear you, I hear that sadness for it.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.660]   It's just, it's one, I feel sad too about losing Pebble
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.500]   just because I think that we need to have that,
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.500]   you know, a whole bunch of people in the ecosphere
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.300]   so that they're gonna be able to, you know,
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.140]   that competition and new ideas
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.980]   and be able to do things.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.380]   So, you know, it's sad when we lose a great company
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.420]   that made all kinds of different innovations.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.020]   - Steven Levy of Back Channel,
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.940]   you did the Union Eric Manczakowski's kind of exit interview,
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.940]   right? You talked to him after.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.380]   - So is he, how is he feeling?
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:22.660]   He should feel proud, right?
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.980]   - I think he does feel proud.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.020]   I think he was balancing a lot of emotions.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.860]   The day I talked to him was the day that deal closed
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:36.220]   and, you know, he was nice enough to spend time with me
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.060]   and talk about it.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.860]   I think he was upset for his employees,
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:43.980]   more than himself.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.500]   He's, he'll have a soft landing.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.620]   He's not walking away like a rich person.
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.300]   There have been a lot of exits in Silicon Valley
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.900]   where companies didn't do well
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:58.260]   and the executives walked away, you know, super rich, right?
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.260]   You know, they managed to take money off
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.820]   and buy Ferraris or whatever.
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.980]   - So he never took the money off the table on any of that?
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.260]   - I can't speak to what he did or didn't take off,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.100]   but I know that--
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.700]   - He ain't driving a Ferrari.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.740]   - He's not driving a Ferrari.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.340]   He's not living in a palace.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:19.620]   But if I was starting a hardware company
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.660]   and I could hire him, I certainly would.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.260]   I think this is a guy who knows how to go to China
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.740]   and, you know, get a product together.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.580]   - Right.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.340]   That is increasingly useful skill.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.180]   I have to say.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.580]   I was talking about websites,
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.820]   I was thinking about Joshua Topolsky
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.660]   who's doing kind of something a little swimming upstream.
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:42.660]   He's just launched his new site, theoutline.com.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   And kind of, I mean, content aside,
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.900]   I'm not really sure where he's going with the content,
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:51.660]   but it's an interesting design,
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:55.020]   really targeting mobile, I think,
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.300]   with a lot of scrolling sideways and up and down,
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.620]   scrolling and animated graphics.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.060]   And have you guys played with it?
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.900]   When I was curious what you thought of it?
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.820]   - I'm not crazy about it.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.820]   It's tough to read, even on mobile.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.180]   It's like, it's very jarring and like neon
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.380]   and it just seems unnecessary.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.580]   I mean, we saw this when they're experimenting
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.980]   in the early days of the Verge,
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.940]   trying to stuff a lot of layout
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:28.940]   and responsive designs and so forth onto the web.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.900]   And it just doesn't always make sense on the web.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.820]   I just want to be able to read it clearly.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.860]   - Well, I wonder, and maybe Stephen Levy,
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.420]   you could talk to this about the idea
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.780]   of creating a site these days.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:43.340]   I mean, it seems to me nobody goes to a site anymore,
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.700]   to read stuff.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:48.260]   They get to an article from Facebook or Twitter
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.060]   or Friends or whatever via links.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:53.340]   And my initial thought was that one of the things
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:56.060]   Josh was trying to do here is make it sticky,
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.260]   that once you get to the site,
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.420]   because of the interesting design
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.820]   or kind of encouraged to browse around a little bit,
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.420]   what's your experience with the back channel?
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.220]   Do people enter at the front door?
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:11.740]   - Increasingly, when we started,
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:16.740]   actually you couldn't even go to backchannel.com,
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.860]   it was medium.com/backchannel.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.940]   Eventually we did manage to,
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.300]   medium changed its policy and did domains
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:30.700]   when they decided to emphasize publications more.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.900]   And then we did manage to get backchannel.com.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.340]   So we're starting to see some.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.580]   But one reason why I went to start it on medium
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.500]   is that I thought it was gonna be super tough
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.540]   just to start something on its own
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.660]   without some sort of traffic funnel.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.300]   And that dovetail with Evan Williams theory
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.060]   that there's gonna be just a very few platforms,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.180]   whether it's Twitter or Facebook and something else.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:59.700]   And people aren't gonna hopscotch from one place to another
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:03.700]   that you're gonna get your attention from platforms.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.700]   And then medium would be one of those platforms.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.540]   So right now we've got about 150,000 followers
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.620]   just on medium, right?
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.180]   So that's the slice of the world
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.220]   which is signed in the medium.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.740]   150,000 of those people are signed in.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.940]   And then when they open their medium app,
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.980]   they could see, oh, there's a story on backchannel.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.820]   You haven't read.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.980]   And they get a daily email saying,
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.060]   here's what you missed in backchannel.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:29.300]   So we can get a really good chunk of our traffic,
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.740]   a baseline from that.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.020]   In addition to people coming through recommendations
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.700]   in Facebook or Twitter, Hacker News or whatever.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.860]   - I just find this interesting.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.900]   I guess it's a little bit inside baseball,
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:44.940]   but I noticed my own habits changing a lot.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.700]   And it's really changed because of two things,
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.780]   Facebook and Twitter.
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.620]   That that's the site most people.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.620]   I mean, I have medium.com and backchannel.com bookmarked.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.180]   But I'm much more likely to go to Facebook
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.820]   and follow links into those sites.
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.860]   - It's not the bookmark, don't you follow us on medium.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.620]   You don't get a little email saying yesterday.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.660]   - No, no, that's okay.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.500]   So this is-- - Does anyone do that anymore?
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.580]   - Yeah, everybody, this is the new thing.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.420]   It's the new hotness.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.260]   - I don't think I'm almost, whenever someone says,
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.700]   my site wants to send you a notification,
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.500]   I want to be able to turn that off.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.140]   - Turn that off always.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.500]   - But Jason, we have a clue.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.340]   - Jason, we have a clue.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.180]   - Jason said the same thing to me.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:28.340]   He said email 100% of email, he said,
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.980]   email is a much better way to get to people.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.140]   You should have an email.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.940]   And I, maybe again, I think maybe I'm an outlier
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.900]   'cause I ignore my email because that's too much and I can't.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.380]   I'm so fucking ocean.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.140]   I feel like I'm drowning in it.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:42.980]   Maybe normal people.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:47.420]   - Well, news letters are actually coming back big time.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.260]   - Right.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.620]   - And so we do a newsletter every Friday.
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.420]   It's either written by me or Jesse Hample,
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:57.300]   who's my colleague, a fantastic writer
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.820]   or Sandra Oppson or amazing executive editor,
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.580]   three of us, alternate that.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.700]   And we try to write something original in there
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.580]   that you might want to read in that newsletter there.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.300]   And we've got getting a lot of great feedback.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.540]   It goes out to all our followers
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.380]   unless they choose not to get it in their inbox.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.660]   And a sizable percentage will open those mails.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.340]   We'll get comments on it that will interact
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.780]   with it like a regular story.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.940]   So that's another way to reach people.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.780]   - How does it be?
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.180]   - I think that for Dopolsky's site,
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.020]   I think that he went for being different
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.020]   and so that you knew that you're at his site,
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020]   which is interesting.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.860]   But I think that sometimes different is not always better.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.860]   I think that most people go,
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.780]   they want to surf the internet to de-stress,
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.300]   to get news, but in a way that's really calming
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.340]   and I don't feel comfortable with a site
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.300]   that's kind of gives me a sensory overload feeling
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.860]   that it's almost screaming at me.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.380]   And I think that that's where it fails.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.780]   A little bit too much is sometimes a bad thing.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.500]   - This reminds me of the color scheme
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.940]   of the early Wired magazine, frankly.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.500]   - Definitely, definitely.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.900]   I think that's definitely his model.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.500]   You know, there was just a documentary released
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.340]   by Red Bullhole Places about early Wired
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.660]   and I watched it a little nostalgia trip.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.500]   - Oh yeah.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.420]   - And the art director was talking about how,
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.420]   they had his deal with his Italian press,
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.820]   the printed on my quality paper.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.620]   And they did all these exotic neon inks.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.020]   And when they went, the first running came off the test
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.780]   and they said, "That's not intense enough."
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.660]   And they made him for morning, morning.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:31.020]   Like poor cowbell.
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.100]   And they wanted it until it went beyond the machines,
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.460]   the printing presses capability to do it without smearing.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.140]   They got it to the point of smearing
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.540]   and dialed it back a bit.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.380]   - Wow.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.220]   - So it just wouldn't appeal to the phone.
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.140]   - And of course you couldn't read it for lover money.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.900]   - You couldn't read it without getting a migraine.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.700]   - But I survived and everybody.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.140]   Were you there, Stephen, at the beginning with Lewis and Jane?
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.020]   Were you with it?
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.340]   - I was, I wrote the second cover story for Wired.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.340]   And back then I wanted to show it to people,
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.860]   without giving them the whole issue.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.780]   So I tried to Xerox it and my text did not show good
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.660]   Xerox because the whole page looked like a flag
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.100]   with a red and white.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.100]   - It was probably a smart way to deal with copyright.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.260]   Get to buy the magazine if you wanted to read it.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.100]   - Very good.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.140]   - I'm gonna have to watch that document.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.860]   I did not know that backstory that they actually,
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.420]   they wanted to saturate that page.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.300]   Wow.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.140]   - Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.140]   - More is not better.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.580]   - Yeah, I'll have to see that.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.940]   What does business insider do about all of Stephen?
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.820]   I know you're not responsible for driving traffic
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.140]   and everything, but I'm wondering, do they see it?
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.180]   You know, I look at BuzzFeed and Vice,
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.260]   I mean, BuzzFeed said we don't think there is even
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.820]   a homepage will even exist anymore at some point.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.020]   They believe that their primary platform is Facebook.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.460]   - Yeah, I mean, we have a lot of distribution channels,
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.500]   but we're talking about this and I just took a peek
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.900]   at our chart beat and almost always without fail,
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:05.540]   the top page being right on business insider
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.500]   is the main page.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.060]   So people, thousands of people at a time
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.540]   are literally typing in business insider.com
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.300]   and seeing what the latest is.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.620]   And I think a lot of that is a testament to,
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.500]   we take great pains to make sure there's always
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.460]   something fresh and new every time you load the homepage
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.700]   if there's something that you can just always
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.940]   come to business insider.com and get a snapshot
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.300]   of what's going on in tech and finance and business
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.340]   and now of course, politics.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.060]   But yeah, Facebook is a huge driver for us.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.420]   Increasingly, Google 'cause of AMP on mobile
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.020]   is a big deal for us now.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.660]   Twitter is negligible.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.740]   - Whoa, really interesting.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.500]   - Yeah, I don't think any publisher would say
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.860]   they get a lot of traffic from Twitter,
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.460]   even BuzzFeed and all those guys.
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.260]   And then of course, so I mean, it's a mix.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.900]   I mean, we try to be as many places as we can
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.140]   and be kind of platform agnostic
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.220]   and our goal is to have people enjoy the content
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.380]   where they are.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.940]   So whether that's Facebook instant articles
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.780]   or clicking through from Facebook
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:14.220]   or I think we've built such a really powerful homepage
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.220]   that like, especially during repeat times,
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.060]   it's not unusual to have a couple thousand people
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.260]   just on, you know, typing in business
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.820]   and so they were.com.
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.660]   - I mean, I guess-- - I think that also
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.700]   Business Insider has a good deal of trust.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.300]   I think that it's gonna be a rare thing
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.260]   for a Business Insider article
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.980]   to get the Facebook Scarlet Letter.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.180]   - Oh yeah, we're not fake news.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.980]   Yeah, we don't have to worry about that.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.820]   - Yeah.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.900]   - I love the You Said Scarlet Letter.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.060]   - It's kind of what it is, isn't it?
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.060]   - So what is, what, this is the latest
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.620]   on the fake news story.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.500]   Facebook is going to,
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.100]   according to you guys at Back Channel,
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.820]   you said Scarlet Letter actually,
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.260]   that's the Penis Scarlet Letter to Fake News.
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.340]   What are they gonna do?
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.020]   - So it's kind of interesting.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.420]   So they were, they had this dilemma
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.260]   that these phony stories were getting circulation.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.780]   And when you see them on Facebook, of course,
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.100]   something created in a Macedonian coffee house,
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.820]   looks just as legitimate as the story
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.980]   from the New York Times or Back Channel
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.080]   or Business Insider or wherever.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:25.020]   And some people, I guess, are affected by it.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.940]   We'll buy this stuff.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.460]   And whether they do or not, that's the perception
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.140]   and Facebook got the answer for it.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.980]   But Facebook does not want to be in a position
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.900]   of being the arbiter of what truth is
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.700]   or what a legitimate publication is.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.060]   So they basically outsourced this problem
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.340]   to these fact checking organizations
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.740]   who were happy to take it on for free
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.940]   because that's part of their mission
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.140]   and I think their profile will be elevated if they do this.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.660]   So there's this little system where now
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.220]   the people can report things
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.340]   if they think it's fake news.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:02.340]   Facebook will algorithmically try to identify some of the stuff.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:07.460]   And then if it passes the test,
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.100]   it'll get sent on to these places like Snopes or--
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.860]   - Help me hear though, because they've had
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.900]   a report fake news for a long time.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:16.740]   In fact-- - It was buried.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.580]   It was buried.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.940]   - It's buried still on mine.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.860]   So I'm looking at post-sides.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.940]   - No, you don't get it.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.420]   It doesn't turn onto you yet.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.660]   - Uh-huh.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.060]   So right now, report post and then I don't know
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.900]   what I should do.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.780]   I don't think it should be on Facebook.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.820]   Continue, it's annoying, it's pornography,
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.420]   because oh, finally here, it's fake news.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.260]   - Oh, there it goes.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.100]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.340]   - But that's like four layers deep.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.540]   - You had to go deep, so that's the current one.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.980]   But right now it comes up on the first menu.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.220]   And then if you type it's a fake news story,
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.340]   they'll ask you whether you want to alert
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.620]   the person who posted it,
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.900]   or whether you want to report it.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.740]   It's a fake news story, in which case
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.940]   it'll be registered as that.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.660]   And if enough people register it,
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.740]   and it passes a couple of--
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.340]   - Are the humans involved?
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.340]   So at that point, does it go to a human?
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:08.260]   - You know, it's generally an algorithmic
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.860]   identification there.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.980]   - I give concern--
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.420]   - So along the line, there could be people involved,
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.740]   but maybe that's the last step there.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.940]   Some people were wondering whether you can do
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   like a denial of service attack on these--
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.780]   - Exactly.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.620]   - Exactly.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.460]   - Just clicking.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.300]   But I don't think you can.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.900]   I don't think you can click on a story
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.180]   from the New York Times,
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.860]   and if you're part of some sort of
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.660]   anti-New York Times movement,
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.260]   and then make PolitiFact check the New York Times.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.820]   It'll look at the algorithm,
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.100]   it'll look at the publication that originated,
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.460]   and they'll see how well this is publication,
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:47.540]   this is publication of followers,
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.540]   how it's the traffic of this publication,
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:54.180]   and it'll be able to like eliminate the New York Times.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.460]   I'm pretty sure that the way it's set up,
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.940]   that even though Facebook says it's not possible,
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.700]   but I don't think any of the New York Times stories
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.140]   or Washington Post are gonna get sent off
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.820]   to the fake news fact checkers.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.300]   It'll be interesting to see whether any
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.500]   Breitbart stories eventually pass that test there.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.020]   - See, I think that this is a legitimate concern
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:21.020]   because it's somewhat can be in the eye of the beholder.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.100]   Go ahead, Georgia.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.860]   - Right, but they're going for the,
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.740]   yeah, yeah, I think that you're right.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.860]   I think that it's difficult to says what is true
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.740]   and what isn't, there's definitely a slippery slope
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.820]   that we deal with, but the reason that fake news
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.700]   is such an issue is that we're naturally mimics.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.420]   So we see a news story, one is most people don't even
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.140]   read the news story, we just read the title to whatever it is.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:40.980]   - We share before we do.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.780]   - We see something, yeah.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.860]   And so if we see something over and over again,
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:48.020]   eventually, unconsciously, we will believe that it's true.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.260]   And I think that a lot of us like to think that we are above
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.340]   that and that we're very critical thinkers,
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.500]   but when we run through a decompression mode,
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.620]   we're just kind of passively absorbing things.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.460]   And that's why advertising works so well
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.940]   and it's a billion dollar industry.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.060]   And so the good part about what Facebook is doing is it,
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.700]   it just alerts you to say, think twice about this.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:12.500]   So right away, we're gonna look slightly more critical,
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.260]   especially when we're just kind of surfing the net passively.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.100]   And so I think that that's a good part to that,
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.660]   but I think that it goes even further
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.500]   because many of us will think that we are beyond having
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.060]   to really look at things critically
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.180]   because we have a certain amount of technology
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.660]   or we're so educated.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.980]   And that's when we're more easily swayed
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.020]   is when we don't think that this could be an issue
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.260]   in the first place.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.660]   - Let me use this as an example.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:40.500]   - A citizen is gonna buy Pebble for $740 million.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:48.540]   Not a true story, but not fake news or is it?
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.260]   - Right, so that's how we're getting it wrong.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.740]   That's not the purpose.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.060]   - So we can--
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.820]   - I agree that you could probably in many cases say,
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.060]   this is factual, this is not factual,
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.820]   but simply not being, this is important,
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.780]   not being factual does not make it fake news.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.620]   - Right, and so--
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.620]   - So now what?
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.980]   'Cause I think you could make a litmus test
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.420]   that would have to do with factuality.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.260]   The Pope, you go call the Pope, did you endorse Donald Trump?
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.620]   No, I did it odd.
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:19.580]   Okay, the Pope didn't do it, that's fake news,
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.620]   but it's not always just factuality, it's intense, right?
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.620]   And once you get to that--
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.260]   - So that's talking, yeah, Facebook told me
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.060]   they said at this point, they're going for what they call
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.540]   bottom of the barrel hoaxes.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.940]   The things done with no--
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.900]   - Stuff snopes with a debunk.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.900]   - Yeah, but snopes also debunks things,
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.300]   they might debunk the $740 million--
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.660]   - That's true, that's not a hoax.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.780]   - But at this point, Facebook is saying,
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.460]   we're going after the bottom of the barrel,
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.020]   intentionally misleading hoaxes, right?
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.660]   From places that even pretend to be
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.940]   kind of news organizations that they're not there.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:07.580]   So at this point, you can pretty much know
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.540]   what you see it, what they're talking about.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.820]   Though I don't think that solves the larger problem of truth.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.740]   So I think there's places you can look at,
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.260]   I'm going to use some right-wing places,
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.580]   maybe people will be unhappy with me,
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:22.540]   but Breitbart and Fox sometimes will do things
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.340]   that have been debunked before they publish it,
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:29.180]   before they go with it, particularly about climate change,
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:34.180]   and they'll stock the deck and write things
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.500]   that they maybe aren't even true.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.100]   And that's another level of what some people
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.780]   are calling fake news, or certainly things
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:47.180]   that people don't want to see on their news feed.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.100]   - Right, Facebook, this is the Scarlet Letter,
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:51.940]   this is the little flag they're going to put on here,
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.140]   it's a red square with a triangle
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.020]   and an exclamation mark disputed by third party fact checkers
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.860]   and learn why this is disputed.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:04.820]   I guess that's fair, I mean, they're not blocking it, right?
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.780]   - No, no, no. - They're just letting you say
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.900]   be a little bit more conscious of that.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.820]   - I don't think this is going to change anything though,
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:14.060]   because I think chiefly people share fake news,
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.300]   not because they want it to be true,
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:17.580]   or they believe it to be true,
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.380]   but because it reflects a worldview they believe,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.380]   and it's like, it's a nod, it's a pat in the back,
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.740]   it's a, so it has nothing to do really with the content
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.780]   of the story, in my opinion, it's more a cultural thing,
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:37.940]   which of course this doesn't hurt, I guess.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.500]   - Well, why? - With a guy,
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.740]   with a guy who shot up the pizzeria,
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.060]   how gone, if he had seen that little thing on the bottom,
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.180]   I don't know.
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.980]   - Yeah, I don't think this is going to stop that guy, right?
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.380]   He's just going to say, well of course they're disputing it,
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.420]   'cause they're in on the whole thing,
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.500]   and they're probably child pornographers too.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.380]   - No, well I think that where it becomes important
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   is that how does fear-based or insightful news
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.060]   work on our brain?
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.980]   So when you read something and it makes you feel an emotion
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.980]   of fear or worry and you feel protectionistic,
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.820]   you're activating your limbic system,
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.260]   which is like that middle reptilian part of your brain,
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.140]   and the problem with the reptilian system
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.300]   is it's highly emotional, but it's not really connected
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.860]   to your analytical cognitive center of your brain.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:25.420]   And so it almost like goes into a belief system
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.980]   that is past analytical thought,
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.660]   and that's where fears and phobias come in.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.860]   You might be scared of the dark,
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.100]   but know that nothing bad is going to happen in the dark,
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.060]   yet you still have this irrational fear towards it.
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.620]   So news stories that say, this person is dangerous,
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:44.300]   or this type of media is going to melt your children's brains.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.980]   Without having that little tiny moniker of saying,
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:50.020]   this might not be true, immediately it creates
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.780]   an emotional reaction that supersedes analytical thought,
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.300]   and then we are a little bit more fearful of that,
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.820]   or at least cautious to that.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.060]   You hear that enough?
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.620]   It becomes belief.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:02.780]   Because that part of your brain says,
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.980]   you know what, we might as well be safe than sorry.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.820]   And that's why this is so important,
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.140]   is that even the most rational of people,
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.860]   if you hear something enough that I should be scared of this,
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.340]   you might start to be cautious,
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.220]   and then with enough repetition,
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.620]   you might actually believe it.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.380]   - Yeah, and I think, all right,
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.220]   you got to keep mine. - You got to keep mine.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.380]   - You also got to keep mine.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.620]   - You also got to keep mine. - No, actually it's not, though, Leo.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.620]   It's actually all of us.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.260]   We are not a person that you can make.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.220]   I think that that's a misunderstanding
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.340]   of why this stuff gets shared.
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.420]   I think many of the people share this stuff.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.860]   It's not whether they believe it or not.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:40.420]   It reflects a worldview that they believe.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.500]   I also worry about what about the Andy--
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.940]   - World view usually of fear or protectionism
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.300]   or incitfulness.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.620]   And there's a reason, probably from their own upbringing,
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.580]   that they have that belief system in the first place
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.260]   without radically thinking about it.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.180]   - Do you want Facebook to start telling you that?
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.780]   - I just think that-- - You poor little person.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.260]   You're living out of your limbic system.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.980]   We got to help you here.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.820]   That bothers the hell out of me.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.420]   The last person I want telling me,
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.940]   what my beliefs are is Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.220]   - Well, those are the choices that--
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.980]   - Other people crowds say that maybe you should think
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.740]   twice about something isn't a bad thing.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.580]   Now, I'm not saying that maybe Mark Zuckerberg
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.420]   should be the one that's doing it,
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.740]   but I think that you would be greatly,
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.460]   it makes it easier-- - Crowdsourcing it
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.500]   is also fraught with peril.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.180]   - For sure. - And I worry about
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:34.780]   the Andy Borowitz is at the New Yorker in the onion
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.600]   because I think a lot of satire is also fake news.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.860]   - So I disagree with that to a degree
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:45.140]   because should Facebook be doing this?
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.260]   Should Mark Zuckerberg have to say of what's true
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.260]   and what's not true and what's at hoax
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.300]   and what's not hoax?
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:54.660]   Of course they should because they are a major distributor
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:58.180]   of information and news and with that comes an awesome
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.420]   responsibility to make sure people are getting accurate
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.540]   information and not just, it's dangerous.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:06.860]   As we learn with the pizza gate thing,
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.420]   it can be dangerous otherwise.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.260]   And it took them a long time or too long rather
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.580]   to kind of admit to themselves,
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.460]   wow, we really do have this responsibility.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.020]   We really do have an effect on how people think and work
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.420]   and possibly an effect on elections and so forth.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.980]   And it's the stuff that traditional media has done forever.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:29.300]   You know, us here as the journalists on this panel
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.020]   do it every single day.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.460]   Every single day, we're vetting stories for truth,
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.180]   we're vetting stories for accuracy,
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:38.340]   we're vetting stories for hoaxes and you know,
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.020]   we're vetting Trump's tweets, whether or not he's lying
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:44.260]   about millions of people illegally voting and you name it.
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.100]   And you know, there's always that discussion as Facebook
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.820]   and Media Company, as Google and Media Company.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.980]   Whether they want to be or not, you know,
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:57.380]   as a distributor of news, there is an curator of news,
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.340]   you have a responsibility to make sure it's right.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.580]   And so what this fake news button or whatever you want
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.900]   to call it does is it kind of de-emphasizes it
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.020]   and the algorithm too.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:09.340]   So, you know, hopefully it doesn't go quite as viral
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.700]   on the platform.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.260]   And then it's also saying, hey, you know,
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.820]   we edit this, we try to vet this and it might be fake.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.580]   So, you know, take it with a big grain of salt.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:21.460]   So I think it's nice to see them, you know,
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.660]   at least attempting to take some responsibility
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.900]   for all this media they're putting out there.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:31.580]   - Yeah, I think that the Google really is the,
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.340]   you know, the model for dealing with this.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.500]   And I find it interesting.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.420]   So I wrote a book about Google and running one
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.580]   about Facebook now.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:41.620]   And Facebook is undergoing a lot of the things
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:46.100]   that Google did when it realized that its search engine
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.940]   had such power that their logical view
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.180]   of how it worked and how it was fair
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:54.100]   really wasn't enough for people, you know,
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.780]   when they felt that it wasn't treating them fairly here.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:01.780]   And in this case, people feel that there's consequences
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:05.900]   from the newsfeed circulating these stories
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.260]   that, you know, don't fit the Facebook's engineering
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.580]   response, which would be, well, it shouldn't feel,
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.500]   you should basically know it, take everything
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.900]   with a grain of salt because it's just these people
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.740]   linking, right?
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.620]   And, you know, and it isn't all determined by an editor.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.700]   And Facebook, of course, can't edit a billion stories a day.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:28.460]   It's a difference between business inside or, you know,
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:32.500]   and the other places in Facebook is that, you know,
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.100]   no human being can get all the stuff that goes
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.300]   through Facebook there.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.300]   So they're trying to find that balance
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:44.300]   on how to do things while not stifling the voices
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:49.020]   and the desires of the people who are their customers
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.700]   who come to that newsfeed and spend time there,
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.200]   which is what Facebook wants.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.460]   - I worry that we get out of this an impression that
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:03.860]   every story is either true or fake
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.620]   and that we can tell the difference.
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.420]   I mean, there are people in our chat room right now
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.260]   who are saying, and you believe what the CIA says
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.380]   about Russian hacking, when do we start believing the CIA?
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.420]   Who's gonna determine whether that's fake news or not?
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.300]   I just worry about algorithm solutions.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:25.900]   And I have to point out, Steven, that Google is as much
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:29.900]   responsible for this as Facebook is even to this day,
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.580]   partly because of AdSense, that's where these fake news
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.860]   sites get their revenue.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.460]   And partly because search results to this day
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:41.260]   continue to pull up all sorts of spurious stuff, right?
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.260]   - Right, well, I mean, it wasn't--
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.900]   - Google didn't solve it, did they?
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:51.060]   - Well, they didn't solve it, but there was a case.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:55.300]   The solution that Facebook has in this bottom
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:00.300]   and the barrel, after the bottom of the barrel places
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.540]   is very similar to me than the one that Google used
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:08.100]   when it turned out that if you typed in JU, J-E-W
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.860]   in the search engine, Google didn't wanna take down
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:16.860]   the site and block the site that was this anti-Semitic
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.460]   Holocaust denier site that came up towards the top
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.060]   of the results, but instead, they automatically took
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:27.620]   out an ad that would appear whenever someone pulled this up,
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.700]   explaining why that site showed up
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.740]   and what kind of site it was there.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.380]   So in this case, Facebook, you can still even
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.860]   share something once it gets a scarlet letter,
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.580]   but you get a warning saying, hey, you're sharing
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.300]   something like that, and you might like to share,
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:46.500]   in which case, then other people will also see
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.780]   the scarlet letter, which is like sewn very tightly
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.300]   onto the length that you can't get rid of.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:55.100]   - Wow, well, I see potential problems
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.340]   I'll have to watch and see how it's--
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:59.860]   - Well, it's a very difficult problem because, again,
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:02.980]   you don't wanna close the newsstand down
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.460]   because things in the newsstand are there, you don't like.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.300]   - There's a lot of fake news.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.860]   - Yeah, because in the end, that could be the same thing
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.420]   that would happen to your point of view.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:11.260]   - Right.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.100]   - And so the danger could run those ways.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.740]   - My point is exactly that censorship is always across.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.620]   - I fully agree with you on that.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.820]   I think that just giving a little moniker to think about it
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:22.860]   is a minor inconvenience and it's not actually shutting down
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:23.740]   thought.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:26.380]   In the end, the only thing that really helps us
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:30.260]   against groupthink would be education in learning how
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.780]   to critically think.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.100]   And right now, that's not happening enough in our school
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.340]   systems and we're becoming almost the worst.
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.980]   We're kind of like just wanting to get little bites
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:43.020]   of information and having them be as easily digestible
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:43.860]   as possible.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:45.860]   And so most people are just really reading the headline
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:46.860]   anyways.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.500]   - There's a couple of interesting efforts to try to increase
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:58.500]   news literacy online, Wauch-Mossberg and Karen Wickry,
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.460]   formerly of Google and Twitter, are involved in one.
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:06.620]   My fear though, is anyone who would be interested
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.460]   in becoming more media literate is probably not the kind
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.660]   of person who's consuming these fake news articles.
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:13.900]   - And that's wonderfully sad.
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.940]   I think that that's why it has to be in the school system.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:16.940]   It's so important.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.140]   - Well, I mean, there's also, I wish I could remember
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:26.140]   the name of this thesis that the people,
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.460]   the evidence you're a psychologist,
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:30.220]   you probably have read these studies, Georgia,
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.820]   the evidence is that people who consider themselves
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:36.860]   well read and literate are in fact more easily swayed.
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.860]   - Yes.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.460]   - Because, that's the problem that they think that,
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:45.020]   I've read all, I've studied it up, I'm so smart.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:45.860]   What does that call?
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.860]   - It won't happen to me.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.980]   - I'm so smart, why don't they just, I don't know.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.460]   - I don't fall for fake news.
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460]   - It'll tell us it's fake news, right?
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.380]   - Oh, we all have, we all have, yeah.
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.220]   - Yeah.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:01.180]   - Okay, I work tomorrow, we're interviewing Tim Wu,
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.020]   who's new book is called The Attention Merchants.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:06.660]   In the book he talks about the first fake news,
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:10.980]   which actually goes back to the first newspaper in 1862
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:15.740]   where there was a real newspaper war going on in New York.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.380]   Newspapers didn't, were expensive at first,
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.780]   didn't make a lot of money.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:23.020]   And a couple of publishers came along,
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.060]   I don't remember the names, I'll have it for you tomorrow
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.060]   'cause it's in the book.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.500]   I think it was, I think Benjamin Day, I think.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.980]   - Benjamin Day, who said, well, first of all,
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.860]   we're gonna charge a penny, which is a loss at a loss,
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:36.940]   but we're gonna make the money up in display ads.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.900]   And in order to boost circulation started,
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:45.620]   made up a story about telescopes seeing the people
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:48.260]   on the moon and describing the people who lived
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:50.060]   on the moon and the houses that they had,
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.820]   and it was a sensation and sold papers like crazy.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:56.220]   - Fake news is as old as mass media, literally.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.140]   - I would say it's even older
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:02.500]   'cause you can take a look at cave paintings of unicorns
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.300]   and of aliens coming down.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.420]   And if you take a look at the graffiti in Fucke-Pom-Pay,
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.500]   which is a fascinating read,
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:12.580]   it is all spreading of certain belief systems
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.860]   of different people and anger towards the government.
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:19.300]   And so I think that fake news is as old as humanity, really.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:25.140]   And so ultimately I fear that this is another witch hunt
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.820]   and it really is about censorship.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.820]   Sensorship from the left is opposed to censorship
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.460]   from the right, but censorship all the same.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:38.460]   And I really worry that that opens a bad precedent.
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:43.020]   But I also think that there is a problem with fake news.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:46.180]   I think you're right, that I think it does influence people.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.180]   So I don't know what the answer is.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.460]   I also wish that we didn't get so much of our news
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:55.500]   from Facebook, but that's another problem entirely.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.300]   Where are you gonna go though?
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.500]   See, I'm one of those people who reads all
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.540]   the different sources, so I know I know what's going on.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.020]   - I'm waiting for the first word of someone who said,
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:09.780]   "Man, if I had known that Hillary was not a demon,
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.220]   "I would have voted for her."
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:13.660]   (laughing)
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.700]   - Here's the article, "Thank you, Bleak in the Chatroom.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.960]   "Why smart people are stupid, this is Jonah Lehrer
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.220]   "and the New Yorker."
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.900]   Jonah Lehrer was writing originally
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.340]   for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.020]   And-- - Jonah Lehrer?
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.140]   - Yeah, is that interesting?
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.860]   Yeah, this goes back to 2012.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:34.540]   - Right, I guess that he was believed him, right?
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.860]   - He was a famous fabricator, right?
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:43.500]   That's a good point, but he does talk about Daniel Kahneman,
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.460]   who, Professor of Psychology at Princeton,
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:49.680]   who was the one who came up with this evidence
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.840]   that people who think they're smart,
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.320]   smart people suggested that smart people
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.040]   are more vulnerable to thinking errors,
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.560]   because we think intelligence is a buffer against bias,
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.720]   but it's actually a subtle curse.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.760]   And yeah, consider the source though,
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.320]   'cause Jonah Lehrer was also involved
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.560]   a little bit in fake news.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.540]   - Well, I think, but apparently--
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.380]   - Enhanced.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.900]   - He's a new book on, apparently Michael Lewis's book
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.300]   on Kahneman and his partner is fantastic.
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.320]   - That's where I had just read this was at,
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.120]   Michael Lewis, that's what I was trying to remember, yeah.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.840]   Very interesting, and it was also
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.400]   at the University of Toronto.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:38.500]   So sometimes bias is very hard to detect.
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:39.940]   Let's just leave it at that.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:41.420]   We're gonna take a break and come back with more.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.460]   We had a great week this week, lots of fun at Twit,
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:45.940]   and we've made a little promo
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.660]   to give you a peek at the highlights
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.220]   just in case you missed some watch.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:53.340]   - Okay, Google, turn off the Christmas tree inside.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.180]   - No!
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.420]   - I just love it, oh my God!
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:00.700]   - Okay, Google, turn on the Christmas tree inside.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:03.780]   - No, I can tell you what happened again.
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:06.820]   - This week in Google, I have a little something, something.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.980]   - Oh, you got it, you didn't have to stand in line?
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.580]   - I took advantage of this thing called eBay.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:12.660]   I like the idea.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.420]   I've heard that streaming live videos
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.820]   all the rage these days.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.780]   So I was thinking maybe I should do some of that.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.220]   - Know how.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.140]   - The Microsoft Surface Studio is a beautiful computer,
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.220]   but over the last few weeks, one deficiency
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:28.260]   has become glaringly clear.
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.580]   The storage performance is wanting.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.960]   Upgrading the drives on the Surface Studio isn't hard,
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.460]   but it does require the removal of 32 screws and bolts
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.060]   in about 50 steps.
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.620]   With our new Surface SSD Studio,
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.100]   we benched about 540 megabytes per second read
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:47.020]   and 500 megabytes per second write.
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:50.020]   For those keeping score, that's a little bit faster.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.700]   - Twit, tech just like you like it.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.660]   Surface.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:56.140]   - But you didn't have the black hard rubber
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.900]   Western electric phones that we all had.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.740]   - No, yeah.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.740]   - And with the dials.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:02.100]   - Nor did I have telegrams.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.020]   - I have Snapchat spectacles.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.380]   I know I'm old, I'm snapping right now.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.140]   My God, what more do you need?
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.620]   - I'm cool.
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.860]   - Okay, let me upload that to my story.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:19.700]   Great week ahead, let's see what they'll be covering
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.140]   on TNT this week.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:21.980]   - Thanks, Leo.
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.180]   This week we celebrate Festivus,
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:26.460]   the holiday that's been around since the ancient
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:27.940]   Seinfeld times.
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:31.380]   Among other things, Festivus is a time to air your grievances.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:34.060]   So it's only appropriate that this week's big stories
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.580]   include some of the largest tech grievances of the year.
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.180]   First for all you Galaxy Note 7 loyalists out there,
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:43.380]   Samsung is pushing out an update on Monday, December 19th
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:46.220]   that will prevent your recalled device from charging
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.380]   and eliminate the ability for it to work as a mobile device.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:51.940]   Depending on your carrier, that update might not be pushed
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:55.140]   out until the end of December or early January.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:57.180]   But either way, it's time to bring it back to the store.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:59.300]   My friends, it's time.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.700]   According to Mac rumors, Apple will begin selling their
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:05.300]   wireless air pods in stores on Monday, December 19th,
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.860]   just in time for the holidays.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.220]   If you've waited until the last minute to shop for the
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.060]   holidays and don't forget to use NORAD's Santa Tracker this
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.580]   week to track the old man on his way to delivering all the
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:16.420]   good stuff.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:19.140]   And speaking of holidays, TNT will be here all week.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:21.940]   And Jason Hall and I will cover all this news and a whole
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.740]   lot more every day at 4 p.m. Pacific.
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.820]   That's the week ahead.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.700]   Back to you Leo.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.620]   - Thank you, Megan Moroni.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:29.860]   TNT Monday through Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.700]   Eastern, 2400 UTC.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.420]   By the way, there is a Santa Tracker schism.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.780]   I hope you know that NORAD and Google
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.820]   went their separate ways and Google now has its own
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:42.300]   Santa Tracker that is not with NORAD.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.060]   So pick your--
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:44.780]   - Drama.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.500]   - Drama.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500]   Pick wisely.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.140]   Decide which Santa Tracker.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.380]   I think the results are roughly the same though.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.260]   Just want to point that out.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.740]   I'm going to ask you about those air pods.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.580]   Shut up.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.540]   I'm not asking you computer, stupid computer.
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:29:59.620]   I'm going to ask you about those air pods.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.580]   - I thought that was me.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.420]   - No.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:02.420]   It's just--
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.380]   - Everyone's checking.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.220]   - Windows just doesn't like to be ignored for too long.
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.940]   - Have you noticed that?
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:08.780]   - You have an update.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:09.620]   Come on, do it now.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:13.260]   - Hey, come on, touch me, touch me.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.460]   I dare you to touch me.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:19.820]   This week in Tech brought you today by GoToMeeting,
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.500]   why do a phone conference call?
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.380]   They're so bland, they're so boring, they're so
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:26.340]   two dimensional when you could go high tech
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:27.740]   with GoToMeeting.
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:30.980]   Now what's great is it can be a stealth phone bridge.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.340]   So you could start a GoToMeeting.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:35.580]   It's easier than anything because you just click a link.
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.020]   They have a plugin for Outlook.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:40.020]   It sends an email out to your client or your colleague.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:42.100]   They click the link when the time comes.
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.020]   If they don't have the software, it's installed
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.660]   automatically and quickly.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.900]   And they're there, they're ready.
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.060]   And you couldn't be just talking to each other.
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.540]   Just like a conference call.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:55.780]   But then, you could slip this in, you could sneak it in.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:56.940]   You could say, hey, I'd like to show you
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.740]   my PowerPoint presentation with your mind.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.900]   And then, boom, all of a sudden, he's seeing your screen.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:03.100]   You're sharing the PowerPoint.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:03.980]   You're showing the document.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.580]   You can collaborate on the document.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.380]   And then, you could say, you know what?
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.060]   I wonder how you're liking this.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.500]   Would your mind turn on your camera?
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.260]   I'd like to see your reaction.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.140]   And I'll turn it on mine.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.580]   And suddenly, you've got crystal clear HD video.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:20.620]   And this is not just a conference call, my friends.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:24.620]   This is an engaging, effective, efficient meeting.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:27.500]   Whether it's a sales demonstration, a presentation,
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:30.180]   a collaboration, an ad hoc meeting.
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.980]   I know teams that stay on GoToMeeting most of the day
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:34.180]   because they're all over the world.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.660]   And that's how they stay in touch.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.780]   Nine out of 10 GoToMeeting users agree.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.380]   They close deals more than 20% faster.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:44.540]   And you can do it too, right now, free at GoToMeeting.com.
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.300]   Don't phone it in.
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:46.340]   Start your free trial.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.700]   Like go to meeting.com.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.140]   And you see right there the orange button.
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.580]   Just click that and you're good to go.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:58.140]   Why do a conference call when you do GoToMeeting?
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.500]   We're talking about the week's tech news.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.340]   Stephen Levy is here from backchannel.com.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:07.220]   One of the last two people who used to go to Bill Gates
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:09.140]   Pajama Party or something.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.540]   If I've met, not misunderstood it.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.300]   Markoff is now retired too.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:18.180]   The last one, last man standing, Stephen Levy.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:22.020]   Also with us, Georgia Dow from iMore.com.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:22.820]   Great to have you.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:25.500]   She's a psychotherapist so you can trust her when she talks
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.460]   about your brain.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:32.540]   And Mr. Steve Kovac from the business insider.
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:33.780]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:38.020]   All from the East Coast where you're being voice-coached.
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.180]   Are you from the West Coast?
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.060]   Why did I think you were in New York?
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:41.700]   No, I'm in New York.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.180]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:45.100]   That's the East Coast is the best coast though.
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.820]   No, we're done with the polar vortex.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.500]   It was like almost 60 today.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.620]   Whoa, good.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.540]   I'm flying out here to see my mom in a couple of days
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.900]   after Christmas.
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:57.420]   Verizon has decided, by the way,
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:02.660]   Megan had the story that on Monday, your note seven,
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.820]   if you still have one, and apparently over 100,000 people
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:07.780]   in the United States have not turned in their note seven,
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.020]   Samsung sending out an update that will mean you can't use it
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:12.180]   unless it's plugged in.
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.660]   Verizon said, at first, no, we're not going to do that.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:15.940]   It's Christmas.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.100]   Everybody has the right to have a fire at Christmas.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.180]   Even CeeLo, right?
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.140]   Did CeeLo's note seven blow up?
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.900]   Somebody was saying that.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.980]   Verizon was going to block that update.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:32.700]   Now they say, all right, all right, we'll do it.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:37.460]   Verizon's going to brick your note seven, January 5,
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:42.140]   T-Mobile, December 27, AT&T, January 5, sprint.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.860]   We'll be the one that keeps your note seven
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.540]   going the longest, January 8.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:49.460]   Imagine the liability though, if you're sprinting,
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:52.980]   somebody has a fire on New Year's night.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.660]   You don't need a you-all time log?
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:56.260]   Keep it in the fireplace.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.100]   That's actually a good idea.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.940]   Just keep your note seven in the fireplace.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.940]   That's kind of this.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.460]   That really was one of the big stories of the year is just the--
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.060]   You could gift it to someone you don't like, right?
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.020]   Here's a note seven.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.740]   You get a note seven, know that that person doesn't really
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.300]   care about you.
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:18.380]   So I had said that I don't think that these are exploding
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:24.420]   anymore, but apparently CeeLo, CeeLo Green, who
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:28.460]   is a well-known musician and producer,
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.180]   according to surveillance footage, security footage,
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:34.460]   was nearly killed.
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.620]   Is this fake news?
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:37.620]   Fake!
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.100]   I don't even know what the site that is.
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:40.260]   It was staged.
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.780]   Oh, man.
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:45.060]   I fell for fake news.
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:47.300]   But look, I have video.
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.660]   I would call that satire.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:51.500]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.620]   What is it, satire?
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.620]   Here he is.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.660]   He's in his studio.
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.620]   Security camera's on.
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.500]   CeeLo Green.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.020]   He's there.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.540]   He's talking on his note seven.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:04.500]   When watch, he's got it right up to his head.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.860]   This looks real to me, folks.
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:07.340]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:08.660]   Now he's rolling closer to the camera.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:10.020]   That worries me.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:13.340]   Maybe it's a-- oh, my God!
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.260]   It exploded, and he's lying on the floor.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:19.180]   Motionless.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.940]   OK, apparently this was staged.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.220]   That's when someone needs more press.
[01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.180]   Why didn't Facebook flag this?
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:37.060]   We have a game we play at home with the kid
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:38.740]   when we watch YouTube videos.
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.900]   Real are staged.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:45.100]   And I notice he gets it wrong every time.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.860]   Although occasionally, I will think it's real and it's staged.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:50.540]   Most of it's almost all of it's fake, by the way.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:53.260]   How do you find out?
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.620]   I don't know.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.100]   Scarlet letter.
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:56.540]   I don't know.
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:57.740]   How do you find out?
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:00.460]   Without that Scarlet letter, what do we do?
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:00.780]   I mean--
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.660]   If you have to ask, it's fake.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:05.300]   Yeah, maybe that's true.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.620]   So some big changes at Google.
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.100]   But that's the problem is that people
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:11.300]   are getting better at making things look really authentic.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:13.660]   Yes.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:18.100]   Well, you saw the very funny--
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:21.980]   there were a couple of funny take-offs on--
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:25.420]   oh, what was the holiday love actually?
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:30.020]   Where he goes at the end of the movie and he says--
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.820]   he comes to the knocks on the door and she comes to the door
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.940]   and he says, shh, tell them it's carolers.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:35.260]   And he plays Christmas Carol music
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.820]   and then shows her the title cards.
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:39.620]   So there've been a number of fakes.
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.220]   One was Putin coming to see Donald Trump.
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:46.980]   And Putin says, shh, tell her it's crooked Hillary.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:48.100]   Trump shots to Melania.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:48.660]   It's OK.
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.060]   It's crooked Hillary.
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.540]   And then there's-- I saw another one--
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.260]   So night live didn't want to--
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.180]   I didn't like it.
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:57.940]   With Hillary coming to an electors door.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:36:59.340]   That was good.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:36:59.820]   That was hilarious.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:02.540]   It was actually very funny.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.380]   I believed in both.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.140]   I thought they were real.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.420]   I didn't know.
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.060]   So let's talk about what's going on at Google
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.140]   since we've got Stephen Levy, who knows everything.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.940]   He's got very good sources inside of Google.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:14.620]   One thing I'm hearing from a lot of Googlers
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:17.220]   and people who know Googlers is--
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:20.700]   I'll put it bluntly, so to speak,
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:26.020]   that Larry Page and Sergey Brin are off in space,
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.220]   not paying that much attention.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:29.460]   That Ruth Poor at the new CFO is just
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:31.860]   cutting and slashing, hacking, and hewing,
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:37.580]   and reorganizing Google on better financial basis.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.900]   Does that sound accurate to you?
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:41.940]   Because we do see a lot of changes over there.
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.500]   There's a lot of changes.
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.380]   The alphabet thing--
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.060]   I think the jury's still out.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.660]   I never was in love with it.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.340]   I think that--
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.780]   Splitting Google up into one big holy--
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:56.180]   --that we called alphabet with lots of little companies, Google
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.860]   being its own company run by Sundar Chai.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:58.500]   Yeah, but the bats.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.460]   Yeah, Google is the alpha company,
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.980]   and the rest of them are the bats.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:05.900]   And it just changes the character of those companies.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.540]   It used to be that the hole was more than some of the parts.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:15.100]   Now, parts all have to be accounted for there.
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.580]   So they almost went in the direction there.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.340]   So there was something like fiber.
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:23.500]   It had a mission before, which success
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.980]   was in terms of building the number of people who
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:30.940]   can get the internet and then use Google.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:34.300]   Now that they're asking it to sort of be a business on its own,
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:35.500]   it isn't doing that great.
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.780]   So that's a key example.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.060]   And then the other thing it was supposed to do
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:43.020]   was give the CEOs more autonomy and power.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.940]   And now we're seeing all these CEOs falling off
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.860]   because maybe Google and Google and the other,
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.580]   they use the power.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:52.260]   And they were ticking off people there.
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:55.980]   So I don't think Larry has totally checked out from what I
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.780]   hear.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.340]   I think that in some ways, he likes the structure
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.140]   that he can zoom in and pay attention to the things
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.940]   that he cares about.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:15.580]   But I think that Google itself is sort of recreated--
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:18.100]   the Google part of Google is sort of recreated itself
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:22.700]   by taking on aspects that used to be part of, say, X.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:27.140]   So now there's a research division within Google itself.
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.820]   And the virtual reality is in Google itself.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:35.260]   So eventually, will Google be spinning off companies of its own?
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.420]   Will they become alphabet bets?
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:43.620]   Or will they be just part of an Uber Google there?
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.780]   Because Sundor is doing such a good job.
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:49.300]   Everyone thinks that he's killing it there.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.700]   So it's an interesting time for the company.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:57.780]   But meanwhile, look, the revenue and the business model
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:59.940]   still keeps everything afloat.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.340]   Google's a great engine, right?
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:04.060]   I mean, there's no question about it.
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.700]   They're going to spin off the self-driving car.
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.300]   They've got a name for the company.
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.900]   It's going to be called Waymo.
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:13.540]   Apparently, the change here is that Google's not
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:14.300]   going to build their own.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.300]   They're doing a deal with Fiat Chrysler to make cars.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:21.220]   And the cars will probably have steering wheels famously.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.220]   They have to.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:24.820]   I love it.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.140]   Say against Steve?
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.620]   I just had to have my law.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:29.660]   My law, yeah.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.140]   Yeah, Google's very unhappy.
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:32.980]   They have to build steering wheels in there.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:37.660]   They had this plan that they would send those little bugs
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:41.780]   out there around Mountain View and take people from one
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:43.780]   campus to another.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:45.420]   And they're very unhappy that they
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:47.580]   have to put steering wheels in them.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:50.160]   The information also says that Google
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.700]   wants to launch a company called Shofur, which
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:57.420]   will be a taxi or commercial ride sharing service
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:59.580]   by the end of next year.
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:02.180]   Shofur was actually the code name for the whole Google car
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:03.180]   project.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:07.660]   Ah, Robotaxi service.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.860]   This is what Uber-- maybe this is why Uber is rushing
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.060]   to get its Robotaxis out.
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:16.620]   Maybe they see Shofur coming up behind him.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.780]   Also, let's see, what else has changed in Google?
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:24.900]   There's Calico, which is the anti-aging spinoff.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.300]   That one seems to be doing OK.
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.460]   They have $1 and 1/2 billion in the bank,
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.980]   according to Antonio Rigolado writing for the MIT
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.980]   technology review.
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:39.300]   I think it's interesting how they measure success
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:43.180]   for different bets, because obviously, fiber, they see
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.540]   as more of a shorter term.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:48.380]   They want to see something material in the shorter term,
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.220]   whereas something like Calico, where they're literally
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:54.300]   trying to stop us from dying or get us to living to age 400
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:57.500]   or whatever, they realize that's not going to happen tomorrow.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.020]   That's going to take years or decades of research,
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:01.380]   and they might not even get there.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.540]   So it's interesting to hear how you
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.420]   want to talk about Ruth Porat digging into these companies
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:12.020]   and setting goals and so forth.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:14.700]   Calico is not making any money, but their mission
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.620]   is more way out there.
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.380]   So that's pretty interesting, too.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.580]   And I want to hear what Steven has to say about this,
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:26.340]   just like, what are Larry and Sergey
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.540]   focused on out of all these other bets?
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:31.700]   What's your impression of--
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:35.340]   they're clearly just totally disconnected from regular Google.
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:37.700]   Are they more into things like sidewalk labs?
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.460]   Are they more into these crazy other bets, like curing death?
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:44.500]   I mean, what's your impression, Steven?
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:50.500]   Well, Sergey spends most of his time at X.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:54.460]   And the moonshot, I think.
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:01.100]   And Larry, from what I hear, is also super interested in that.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:05.900]   I know he watches things like sidewalk.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:09.540]   Calico is interesting, because like life sciences, which
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.100]   does have some revenue stream, what Calico possibly could do
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:19.260]   is if some of the scientists make one breakthrough,
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:21.780]   maybe it won't make us live to 1,000 years old,
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:29.900]   but could make us look better for 10 more years
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:33.260]   as we get older, because it's all about stopping aging.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.820]   That's like a multi-billion dollar drug, right?
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:38.980]   So just the prospect of one of those things
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:43.220]   could wind up being a pretty hefty revenue stream.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.460]   It's the holy grail, right?
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:46.220]   And--
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:47.700]   Yeah, but you don't have to go--
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.540]   Yeah, you don't have to get the grail in order
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.860]   to make some money there.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:55.700]   And even something that could stay off, the reaper
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:00.780]   would make you feel younger for a decade or two.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:04.820]   Little pieces of the grail could be pretty profitable.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:05.300]   Except--
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.300]   Maybe they'll--
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:11.420]   It's one of those areas where time is one of those things
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.260]   that we can't stop.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.820]   It comes for all of us.
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:16.740]   And so, yes, the same thing with aging or just looking
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.340]   better, though it's funny that you said that,
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:21.220]   because the naked neural rat is probably one of the least
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.020]   attractive of creatures on the planet.
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:28.100]   And there's some force that are in contention for it.
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:30.900]   But they also have cancer-resistant properties.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:35.100]   And they're also impervious to certain types of pain.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.100]   So it's not even just that.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:40.700]   It's also quality of life that they can improve upon.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.620]   I'd rather die than look like a naked rolled bat.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.860]   Don't they have interesting social--
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:49.020]   They have a high quality of life, I hear, actually.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:51.500]   I think living a colony ruled by a queen,
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.220]   it's similar to the Borg, really.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.380]   Nice.
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:57.220]   They have an interesting social arrangement.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:59.580]   Give me death.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.700]   Give me death.
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.020]   Or give me naked moments.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.940]   Don't be assimilate.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:07.140]   What else is going on at Google?
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:11.580]   Android Things is their new name for their IoT stuff,
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:17.180]   bringing Brillo and Weave together under one roof.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.140]   I would love to see one company, Android--
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:23.420]   I mean, Google or Apple or somebody
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:28.980]   kind of make some sort of progress in this IoT space
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:30.340]   to kind of bring everything together.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.140]   We have all these protocols and companies,
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.580]   and nothing works with anything else.
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.180]   And it's just a mess.
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:37.680]   Right.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.940]   Well, now, what supposedly we should bind them together
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:47.500]   is all these voice products like Echo, now Google Home,
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.460]   and things like that.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:52.060]   So the place where you command them might be the glue.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.980]   But of course, there's about five companies that
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:55.700]   want to be that central hub.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.220]   Right.
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:59.740]   Well, maybe Amazon's got a little lead.
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.860]   Apparently, the wind resorts in Las Vegas
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:09.700]   are putting in echoes in every room, 4,748 hotel rooms.
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:12.260]   I was wondering, well, if you order something,
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:13.500]   where does the product go?
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.380]   Apparently, it's all Steve Wins account.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:19.980]   So go ahead and buy Steve some cashmere socks and have fun.
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.220]   Actually, I think this is a good idea.
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.980]   And boy, it's good for Amazon because it'll
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.140]   introduce people, a lot of people,
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:28.420]   to the Echo, who probably have never tried it before.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.820]   So am I the only one that thought that's the first thing
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.980]   that I would unplug if I was staying in a room?
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:34.620]   Why would you unplug it?
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:36.060]   Because it's creepy.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:36.900]   I go to a hotel.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.060]   One is I want to be unplugged.
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:41.140]   But two is that I want to have control over what's
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:44.300]   being listened to while I'm there.
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:45.860]   Well, at least it's sitting out in the open.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:49.340]   You don't know what they've got in the walls.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:52.700]   Well, I assume that that would be legal versus putting something
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.140]   out in the open, which would be legal.
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:55.620]   So there's even a greater chance of it.
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.780]   That's interesting.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:57.540]   No, it would--
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:00.460]   OK, so would it be-- OK, so if you put an echo in there,
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:03.180]   is that presumed consent then if you listen in on the echo?
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:04.820]   No.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:06.300]   Well, no, but it's assumed consent
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:08.300]   that you don't mind the--
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.020]   you would have to be OK with the privacy policy
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:12.820]   that Amazon already puts out.
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:13.820]   And in that--
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:17.540]   I literally have echoes in every room of my house.
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:17.900]   Am I--
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:20.860]   Yeah, but Leo, you're also live most of your life online.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:22.540]   You're almost always here.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:25.780]   So you're kind of already very comfortable with people
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:27.340]   knowing a lot about your private life.
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:28.980]   Well, nobody's listening to my echo conversation.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:32.020]   Very private when you're out off of Emra.
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:35.900]   Nobody's listening to your echo stream.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.940]   You think it's on all the time.
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:38.940]   And somebody at Amazon is sitting there--
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:41.100]   And let's hear what's going on at the Dow House.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:41.980]   They are.
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:44.380]   The thing is that if they wanted to, they could.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:46.260]   And there's a difference between both.
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.100]   OK, I guess that's true.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:49.420]   In fact, Evernote got in a little bit of hot water
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:52.820]   this week because they announced a new privacy policy,
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:55.340]   something that always been true that Evernote employees could
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:55.980]   look at your notes.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:57.140]   It might from time to time.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:58.180]   That really upset people.
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:00.260]   So they took it back out of the privacy policy
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.540]   without changing the ultimate fact that, of course, they still
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:06.740]   can at any time look at your notes
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.820]   because they're storing them.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:08.900]   That's called cloud.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:15.140]   Oh, we didn't mention the Yahoo hack.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.500]   Actually, I want it before we get to that.
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.900]   I do want to, since we were talking about Google, talk
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.380]   about something Google has a big investment in.
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:24.340]   But of late, there may be people saying
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:26.020]   that the emperor has new clothes.
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:28.220]   And I'm talking about magic leap.
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:33.260]   Have any of you gone to see the magic leap demo?
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.020]   I wish.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:38.580]   I mean, Kevin Kelly did a whole story on it and wired
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.500]   and talked a lot about it and how amazing it was.
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.300]   And they've raised a ton of money.
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:45.500]   But now it turns out, according to some,
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:49.180]   that maybe this technology isn't near ready for prime time.
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:52.860]   They had-- that it looks a little more like this than the
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:55.260]   HoloLens and other augmented reality project that's
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.460]   a little bit farther along.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:59.860]   And in fact, according to one report, it's not even as good
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:00.740]   as HoloLens.
[01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:04.820]   It still requires you wire it up to a massive computer.
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:08.460]   It looks like apparently, magically, might have made a
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:16.100]   best bet on a technology that hasn't really paid off.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.740]   It sounds like the first thing they're going to release is
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:21.620]   going to be kind of like a watered down version of what
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:24.060]   they've been showing people in demos and has been showing
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:28.900]   investors and thousands of people, or maybe 1,000 or so,
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.300]   have tried it under NDA.
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:33.820]   So even if they have used it, they can't really talk about
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:36.300]   the experience publicly.
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:40.340]   But I hate the Theranos comparison for anything now.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:42.260]   So I mean, I feel like, yeah, it's not that.
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:45.060]   Theranos was in all likelihood in a kind of an
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.860]   intentional ruse.
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:49.740]   You don't think magic leap is tricking anybody.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:50.380]   I don't think there--
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.260]   Yeah, I don't think there are potentially.
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.940]   The Theranos thing is a crazy comparison.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:50:00.100]   I mean, the investors in magic leap are the most savvy tech
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.340]   investors on the planet.
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:05.540]   Sundar Pishai is on the board.
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:08.580]   They have other super knowledgeable tech
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:09.340]   investors.
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:17.260]   If magic leap doesn't succeed, then look, they went and
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:18.540]   gave a shot at it.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:21.220]   I personally can't say whether or not I've seen it.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.460]   But--
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.020]   Aha!
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:24.620]   Are you seeing it?
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.740]   You're totally seeing it.
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:25.740]   Aha!
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:28.260]   He's been in the aid.
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:28.740]   All right.
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:31.660]   But I can say.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.020]   But I think what's happened in the past couple of weeks has
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.180]   been a little nuts.
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.220]   The information did a story on it.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:42.100]   The information story was not a story which was the
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:44.700]   equivalent to the Wall Street Journal Theranos story.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:46.660]   It didn't have wrongdoing.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:47.860]   There wasn't like deception.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.100]   It showed what a lot of people knew that they were
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:54.580]   moving as fast as they hoped.
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:55.820]   And these things happen.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:00.780]   There is one accusation in the information story that is
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:04.300]   not great, which is this video that was made and used
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:07.140]   apparently to recruit employees just another day at the
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.500]   office of magic leap.
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.180]   And it turns out it was created--
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.540]   in fact, it even says on the stamp here at the Weta
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:15.540]   workshop, the folks who did the special effects for the
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.060]   Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, it is completely
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:21.420]   the whole cloth that is not using the magic leap technology
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:21.780]   at all.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:23.860]   This is special effects.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:24.060]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:26.420]   No, I think it's clear to anyone that that's not what
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:29.140]   happens when you go to work magically.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:32.300]   That's the way you do your work.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:37.020]   So I think if that's the smoking gun, a big deal.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.380]   I mean, it was a solidly written story.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:43.260]   But I think what was more interesting to me was the way
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:48.020]   that magically responded to the story, which Roni--
[01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:50.900]   the brother was the CEO--
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:52.020]   has gone into it like--
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.220]   he's gone to a little Twitter mad trying to defend
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:57.380]   magically there.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:02.580]   And I think maybe he would be doing better off holding his
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:08.380]   powder and waiting until he had something to share whenever
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:13.620]   that is, contacting his investors and assuring them that
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:17.660]   he's going to be able to eventually do the launch.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:22.540]   And then improve on it and win the long game, which this
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:24.420]   really is.
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:30.780]   So I think that right now, if you follow him on Twitter,
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:32.660]   you're going to get a lot of tweets.
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:33.580]   These things happen.
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:37.100]   I mean, in fact, as all these investors know, and they've
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:41.820]   poured more than $1 billion into magic leap, sometimes you
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:42.500]   make a bet.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.540]   It's a high risk, I reward bet.
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:46.540]   Maybe it takes longer.
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:48.260]   Maybe it doesn't ever happen.
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.060]   But that doesn't mean it's malicious.
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:54.540]   It just means that they're trying something difficult.
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:57.540]   I think it's also just way too soon to judge something most
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:59.540]   people haven't seen publicly, that they haven't done a
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:00.820]   public demonstration of.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:03.540]   And I think the reason why there's so much interest is
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:07.380]   they've been hyping it up for years.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:11.620]   But beyond the money that they've attracted, cover story
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:15.140]   and wired, cover story and forms, this is the future.
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:19.420]   And glowing profiles that don't really say very much.
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.020]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.500]   It feels a little like it's over-hyped.
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:27.380]   It lumps a lot of expectations on the company between the
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:28.660]   amount they've raised.
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:33.660]   And these glitzy magazine stories on them that are
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:36.260]   light on meat.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:39.260]   There's no meat to what's really going on there.
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:41.820]   So it's no wonder why the information wanted to poke
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:45.580]   around and see what the heck's going on.
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:49.100]   I think it's right full to be a little bit skeptical.
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:52.220]   But again, no one's really tried it and they don't have
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:53.060]   their final part.
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:57.580]   No, there's no one asking you to go buy one now.
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:59.020]   Right, exactly.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:01.700]   Yeah, no, it's no skin off my nose.
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:04.420]   I also think it's suspicious when a company will show it
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:08.660]   to people, but then insist that you not talk about it.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.380]   And it's one of the reasons I don't do any NDAs, because
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.740]   I feel like that doesn't help me.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.940]   It doesn't help my audience.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.940]   If I know something that I can't tell them,
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:24.820]   and it feels like, well, okay, why are you showing me this then?
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:27.660]   Who's hearts and minds are you trying to win here?
[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:28.940]   Anyway.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.860]   They have to walk a very careful line because they want to be
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.460]   able to build up press and interest so that they can make
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:38.060]   a certain amount of money that they need in order to
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:41.740]   invest and to develop. But then you also end up with your
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.700]   audience having what could end up being
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.540]   expectation debt. And that's when you have oversold something
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:50.420]   and you under deliver. And then people end up really angry and
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:53.260]   upset with something that they expected would be mind-blowing
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:56.980]   and end up being pretty awesome, but for the fact that you
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:58.180]   expected the world.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:03.140]   They also have 800 employees, which is a lot for a product
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:05.900]   that may not emerge for years.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:06.980]   And they're also losing people.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:10.020]   I mean, you want to talk about the press coverage that they've
[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:12.580]   had. They've lost their chief marketing officer and they've
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:16.620]   lost their head of comms. This week they lost their head of
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:19.820]   comms and one or two ago they lost their chief marketing
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:23.220]   officer. And there isn't that thing to even communicate or
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.340]   market yet. So you got to wonder what's going on there.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:30.700]   Why are they losing that side of the business?
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:32.380]   And they've lost a lot of other employees too.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:35.020]   And those are the people chatting to the press right now.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.460]   OK, so maybe there's no fire, but there's a lot of smoke.
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:40.020]   I just thought I'd bring it up.
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.860]   You're right. None of us have lost any money.
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:44.340]   And the people who are putting money into it are smart and
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:49.140]   know what they're doing. I would assume.
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:50.980]   Let's take a break. Final thoughts.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:52.460]   I do want to talk about that.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:55.340]   The latest Yahoo News. Holy cow.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:57.740]   And whether Verizon is going to keep buying it.
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:55:59.780]   I don't know what's going to happen with the--
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:02.180]   and if Verizon does pull out of the deal, which I'm sure at
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:06.260]   this point it could, what happens to Yahoo?
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:12.140]   But first, a word from our sponsor. Audible is my audio book store.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:15.540]   I love it. I've been an Audible listener since the year 2000.
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:18.060]   That's when I started listening. I've always loved audio books.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.980]   I love the idea of somebody reading to me.
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:23.340]   I learned so much. And there's always times in the day when I
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:25.900]   can't hold a book, but I can listen to a book when you're in
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:27.900]   your commute, when you're at the gym, when you're walking the
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:30.380]   dog, watching the dishes, whatever it is you're doing.
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:33.340]   It's really nice. And, you know, talking about the Amazon Echo,
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:37.220]   it will read to me. I could say, "Echo, read me, read to me."
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:40.780]   And it picks up where I left off my most recent book automatically.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.700]   I love Audible. We're going to get you two free books right now.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:49.060]   If you go to audible.com/twit and the number two,
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:50.740]   there's some really good books in here.
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:53.260]   Everybody's raving. I haven't read it yet about Trevor Noah,
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.380]   the host of The Daily Show's new book, Born a Crime.
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:58.380]   He narrates it. I think that's always great.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:02.100]   Let it go in past this year. This is the biography to read.
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:05.380]   I'm your man. It's available at audible.com.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:09.380]   You want to really get into some heavy history,
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:12.460]   57 hours and 13 minutes, the rise and fall of the third
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:15.420]   right. I have to say, I read this in paper.
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:19.220]   I love this. Audible has so many great books.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:23.380]   All the bestsellers, classics, science fiction, history,
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:26.740]   biography. Here's a little something called hackers.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.900]   Heroes of the Computer Revolution.
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:33.780]   If you haven't read Stephen Levy's classic, you got to read it.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.540]   They have all of your books. I'm sure they do.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:40.420]   Let's see here. In The Plex, that's the book on Google.
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:43.140]   Really a good read. I actually listened to that.
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:46.820]   Insanely great. The Life and Times of the Macintosh.
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.260]   I think I listened to that. I know I listened to the perfect thing,
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:52.020]   how the iPod shuffles commerce, culture and coolness.
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:54.620]   There's good stuff. I now read it insanely great.
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:55.740]   That was the one I read.
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:58.740]   The one that you're never going to do again, right?
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.740]   That's a lot of work.
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:04.740]   The good thing was it was about 10 years after I wrote it.
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:09.740]   To me, what's horrible is if you have to read a book that you just wrote,
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:12.740]   it's like torture because you're sick of it by then.
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:16.740]   You've gone over it 50 times and copy edits and things like that.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:18.740]   You think it's horrible.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:21.740]   Sitting in a studio for four days and reading it will be torture to me.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.740]   But this was fun. It was like visiting an old friend.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.740]   We should mention that, as we were talking about John Markoff,
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:32.740]   I wonder if, yes, Machines of Love and Grace is at Audible.
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:34.740]   This is a wonderful book.
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:38.740]   John Markoff's written so many great books about the tech revolution.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:40.740]   That's probably the classic.
[01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:42.740]   He also wrote what the Dormouse said.
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:43.740]   I wonder if they've got that.
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:47.740]   They've got a lot of his New York Times pieces here as well.
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:48.740]   That's another thing you get, by the way.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:53.740]   If you go to audible.com/twit2 is the daily digest of the Wall Street Journal
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.740]   and one of the New York Times read to you.
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.740]   I guess they don't have his book about the Dormouse.
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:00.740]   That was him, right?
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:03.740]   Or was it Katie Haffner who wrote that?
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:09.740]   Anyway, there are great books at Audible and you must join and you must take advantage of our offer.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:12.740]   You'll go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:13.740]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:16.740]   That's a subscription account that gives you two books a month.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.740]   That's what I do and it's the easiest way to just kind of build up your library.
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:22.740]   I should show you my library.
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:23.740]   Hundreds of books.
[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:24.740]   In fact, I'm going to do a blog post.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:30.740]   I did a blog post a year ago on everything that I had to listen to in 15 years of Audible,
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:33.740]   but I have to update it now with the books from this year.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.740]   There are so many great books and I want to give you links to all of them.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.740]   I'll do that on my blog.
[01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:44.740]   I'm reading right now and I'm sure, Georgia Dow, you probably read this in your studies.
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:52.740]   Man's search for meaning by the legendary Viennese psychiatrist Victor Frankl, the story of his
[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:57.740]   internment at Auschwitz and it's unbelievable.
[01:59:57.740 --> 01:59:59.740]   I haven't actually read it.
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:02.740]   I've followed pieces, but I haven't actually read the book.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.740]   You'll have to tell me how it is.
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:10.740]   He created logo therapy and it was based shortly after he got out of Auschwitz, based on his experiences there.
[02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:16.740]   It's just, well, it's powerful, I guess is the best word for it.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:17.740]   But this is the beauty of Audible.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:20.740]   You get great experiences.
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:23.740]   It's almost like you're there when they're reading to you.
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:25.740]   There's something about the way you're taking it in.
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:30.740]   Here's the book you were talking about, Stephen, the undoing project, a friendship that changed
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:31.740]   our minds.
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:37.740]   This is about David Kahneman and Amos Tversky's studies about the decision-making process.
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:39.740]   Michael Lewis is so great.
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:41.740]   He always picks fascinating subjects.
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:42.740]   This is his most recent.
[02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:44.740]   All of his books are all so unaudible.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:46.740]   Look, pick two and get them free.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:48.740]   You cancel them the first 30 days.
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:50.740]   You'll pay nothing and the books will be yours to keep.
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:55.740]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:59.740]   I've just given you so many books to get.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:03.740]   You know what's funny is now I'm adding that because I have a wish list unaudible that's
[02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:04.740]   got an 80 books on it.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:09.740]   I'm going to add that to the list because I want to read that too.
[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:12.740]   That's the book about the economy and stuff.
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:13.740]   All right.
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:14.740]   Yahoo.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:19.740]   It's just one thing after another with Yahoo, isn't it?
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:26.740]   Now they say that one, and I think it's a story just because of the number, one billion
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:29.140]   user accounts have been breached.
[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:32.740]   This happened a few years ago.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:38.300]   Remember that of course earlier Yahoo had revealed that half a billion accounts have been breached
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:43.740]   in a separate hack.
[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:47.260]   At this point, you got to wonder, is Verizon going to go through with a deal?
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.540]   What happens to Yahoo next?
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:57.940]   We had AOL CEO Tim Armstrong who's kind of helping spearhead that deal at our conference
[02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:00.180]   a week and a half ago now.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:05.740]   This was before the disclosure of the hack and we asked my colleague, Aston Point Blank,
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.220]   put a number on this, what's the percentage chance that this happens?
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:13.980]   He wouldn't do that, but he's like, I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal is going to go through
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:14.980]   week later.
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:15.980]   This happens.
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:19.540]   So it's either going to be a discount.
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:21.540]   You've got to think they still want to add that.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:22.540]   Well, they asked for a billion off.
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:25.860]   They already, Verizon asked for a billion off for the first hack.
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:32.220]   And actually what's really important is what did Marissa Meyer know and when did she know
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:33.220]   it?
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:39.780]   Did she hide this material information from Verizon and other suitors when they were selling
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:41.540]   the company?
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:44.580]   And there's some evidence that she did on the 2014 hack.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:49.980]   This billion account hack happened a year earlier.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:55.820]   So it would stretch credulity to think that Marissa Meyer did not know about this billion
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.140]   account hack from 2013.
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:00.540]   I'm just shocked that that many people still use Yahoo.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:01.540]   I know.
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.540]   That was the other thing.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:07.940]   A billion people really names, telephones, dates of birth passwords.
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:15.340]   The company says it thinks it's distinct from the 2014 hack and it says, oh, the hackers
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:17.860]   aren't in our network anymore.
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:22.020]   So they say, I don't know.
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.020]   What do you think?
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:28.900]   Then pulls out, maybe they'll just ask for another billion off.
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:29.900]   What happens?
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:32.180]   There's still a lot of value in Yahoo, right?
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:35.740]   Because of Alibaba, Japan and all that kind of stuff.
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:38.460]   Well, you don't get the Alibaba stake with the...
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:40.780]   Okay, Alibaba, yeah, that's true.
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:45.780]   But there is a lot of value still tied up in there and they do have a massive user base.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:49.940]   So I mean, it's, and especially for what AOL wants to do with it.
[02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:52.260]   Well, we do know they have a massive user base.
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:53.260]   But...
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:54.260]   No, but people...
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.260]   How much longer?
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.260]   How much longer?
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.820]   That's all a lot of people get through news.
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:01.180]   You want to talk about visiting a homepage for getting your news.
[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:02.580]   Yahoo is massive.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:06.020]   I use my Yahoo for years as my homepage.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:13.700]   I'm happy to say I've grown out of it, but it was my homepage.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.380]   I think we can wrap things up.
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:19.220]   Is there anything I missed that you wanted to talk about?
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.220]   Twitter?
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:24.380]   Anything to say about Twitter?
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.700]   Anything to say about drones?
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:27.700]   Virtual reality?
[02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:29.620]   Oh, AirPods, you got them.
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:31.020]   Oh, yeah, here.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:32.020]   Boom.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:33.020]   You went to the store?
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:34.020]   No, they sent you a review unit.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.020]   They're reviewing it.
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.780]   Yeah, we've seen the pre-production review units.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.580]   Renee Richie had those and others.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:39.780]   You like it?
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:41.740]   Yeah, they're okay.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:47.940]   I mean, so the production ones had a lot of issues.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:49.860]   Mostly related to the software.
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:54.500]   Apple told me ahead of time before you try these, make sure you have the latest iOS update
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:57.460]   and before you start rocking them.
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:02.100]   But before I'd issue, if I was listening to music and someone called me and I answered
[02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:07.140]   the call like the audio wouldn't carry over and it would just get all screwed up and things
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:10.300]   like that, that seems to mostly have been fixed.
[02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:12.260]   My big prop, I just have two issues with them.
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:18.100]   One, they look really goofy when you wear them and two is the control mechanisms.
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:22.460]   It's really annoying to adjust the volume and switch tracks when you're listening to music.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:23.460]   You have to enable Siri.
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.620]   Are you supposed to talk to Siri to it?
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:26.140]   Yeah, so Siri will do this.
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:31.260]   So like, if I want to throw up the volume, I double tap it, say Siri, raise the volume
[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:35.460]   and then the music stops and then plays again with the higher volume.
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.460]   That's just awkward.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:40.620]   I mean, yes, you can use your watch and yes, you can just physically touch on the phone.
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:46.260]   But that little dongle on the wired earbuds were so nice and it seems like they didn't
[02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:48.140]   really figure out a solution to replace that.
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.900]   But other than that, they're cool.
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:50.900]   Battery life is great.
[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:53.540]   Yeah, they're neat.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:58.780]   Apple's getting a little heat too because of their Mac OS update of Sierra 10.12.2.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:02.420]   People were complaining about the new MacBook Pros, including Mossberg, about the new MacBook
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:05.300]   Pro's battery life fluctuating wildly.
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.100]   So Apple did fix that.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:10.020]   They removed the time remaining estimate.
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:11.020]   I love this story.
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:12.020]   Now you just don't know.
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:13.020]   Now you just don't know.
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:14.020]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:16.020]   You can't trust it, so we'll just take it out.
[02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:19.620]   So like the North Carolina legislature said, you're we're in luck.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:20.620]   They're on state employees.
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:22.420]   We're allowed to talk about climate change.
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:23.420]   Right.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:24.420]   Right.
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:29.220]   So when the car that when the coast got flooded, you know, all the time they'd have to say,
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:31.020]   you know, little water.
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:32.220]   These things happen.
[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:33.220]   Right.
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:34.220]   Right.
[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:37.820]   Can we talk about the new emoji for a second?
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:38.820]   Yes.
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:46.860]   The iOS 10.2 is out and we now have many attractive, new, almost good enough to eat
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:48.020]   emojis.
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:50.140]   What are your favorites?
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:51.820]   I well, there's the bacon.
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:52.820]   The bacon's really cute.
[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:55.900]   I like the face plant.
[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:58.020]   The one that's being sick.
[02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:59.020]   The face palm.
[02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:01.420]   Yeah, that's not a face plant.
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:03.420]   That's where you put your face on the side.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:04.420]   My Canadian.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:07.140]   I don't think they have a face plant emoji.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:08.980]   Although that would be okay.
[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:11.380]   But no, it's like, oh, I could have had a VA.
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:12.380]   I could have had a VA.
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:13.380]   Right.
[02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:14.980]   We talk about the creepy clown.
[02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:15.980]   The creepy clown.
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:16.980]   Whoa.
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:23.820]   That's the thing is that emoji used to be a safe place for those of us that are suffering
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:27.500]   from chlorophobia, which is the fear of clowns.
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.500]   What's it called?
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:30.500]   Chlorophobia.
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.340]   See how you spell that?
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:33.340]   Okay.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:34.340]   I'll try.
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:38.220]   You are O P H O B I A. I'm dyslexically.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:39.740]   I don't have to spell anything.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:40.740]   Chlorophobia.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:41.740]   Wow.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:42.740]   I never knew that.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.540]   Yeah, it's the fear of clowns.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:45.940]   There's a disco guy.
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:48.260]   There's a Mrs. Claus.
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:50.180]   This is from emoji P D.A.
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:52.780]   There's a pregnant lady, not a pregnant man though.
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:55.620]   A really creepy clown.
[02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:59.220]   Yeah, I don't really understand the creepy clown.
[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:01.060]   Like who was begging for a creepy clown?
[02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:03.820]   Maybe that's most of us have chlorophobia.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:06.380]   So they have the crooked Hillary?
[02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:10.420]   No, by the way, that's a funny story.
[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:14.060]   The crooked Hillary emoji that the Trump campaign was asking for was what?
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.660]   A couple of bags of cash.
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:21.180]   And then they wanted to simplify it to just a person running off with a bag of cash.
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:24.740]   And Twitter, I think quite rightly said, you can't have a custom emoji.
[02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:28.540]   What are you talking about?
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:32.220]   And then Jack Dorsey's glad he did because he didn't have to go to that tech summit.
[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:34.220]   Here, let me see if I can get the clown for you.
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:37.620]   This is a video of all of the new emoji.
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:42.060]   Apple has decided to make these kind of almost realistic, at least with the food.
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.060]   The humans aren't so much.
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:47.260]   And thanks to Google, by the way, for creating male and female.
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:51.980]   Whoa, that's a singer looking like Bowie.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:54.380]   New male and female for all the occupations.
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:09:00.260]   Google kind of demanded that and rightly so, health worker.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:06.420]   Here's the lying face of Pinocchio nose sneezing face with a handkerchief to the nose.
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:09.540]   Oh, I thought that that guy was trying to sniff a ghost.
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:11.060]   Yes, I thought so too.
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:16.700]   Druelling face, rolling on the floor, laughing, which is a slightly rolling.
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:17.700]   Cafe's with cowboy here.
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:18.700]   Come stand back.
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:19.700]   Watch out.
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:20.700]   Here comes the guy.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:25.700]   Morning.
[02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:27.220]   Are you really scared of that?
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:28.220]   It doesn't look harmless.
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:31.860]   Not that one, but still, you know.
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:38.300]   These are the Apple versions, but these are actually part of the new standard.
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:43.260]   So you will see these on most platforms sooner or later.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:44.900]   Georgia Dow, there you go.
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:47.580]   He said there's a Google clown is not quite so bad.
[02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:50.660]   The Microsoft clown looks like it's made up.
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:51.660]   It's a great play-doh.
[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:58.020]   I think the Apple one is the scariest for sure.
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:09:59.020]   Thank you, Georgia Dow.
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.020]   I'm more.com.
[02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:03.700]   Don't forget her videos at anxiety-videos.com.
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:08.660]   Great stuff, not just on anxiety, but sleep and getting your head together.
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:11.060]   Some really great encouraging videos.
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:12.260]   You do a great job.
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:13.580]   It's always wonderful to see you.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:14.580]   Thank you for joining us today.
[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:15.580]   I appreciate it.
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:16.580]   Thank you so much for having me.
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:20.620]   Steve Kovac is a senior editor at a senior correspondent at Business Insider.
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:23.500]   That means you don't have to carry a red pencil with you.
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:24.500]   You just write.
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:25.500]   This is true.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:27.500]   You'll let the other people edit.
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.500]   Thank goodness.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:33.740]   At Steve Kovac on the Twitter and of course, Stephen Levy, always a pleasure.
[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.740]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:35.740]   StephenLevy.com.
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:36.740]   Thank you.
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:37.740]   Backchannel.com.
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.540]   Do you all tweet?
[02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:41.620]   I mean, should I give your Twitter handles?
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:42.620]   Because you all tweet.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:43.620]   Yeah.
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:44.620]   Yeah.
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:45.620]   Stephen Kovac.
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.620]   One thing I do is tweet.
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:47.620]   Really?
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:49.620]   Yeah, I don't use Facebook or Snapchat and Instagram.
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:51.100]   I'm like Facebook better than Twitter.
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:56.500]   I feel like Twitter is just too fragmented, too hard to follow, too strange.
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:11:02.620]   But I do follow Donald Trump, I have to say, because it's just fascinating.
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:05.580]   I can't take my eyes off his Twitter feed.
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:08.260]   That's one word to say, fascinating.
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:15.060]   Well, I mean, don't you find it like, wow, I can't stop reading it.
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:16.060]   Yeah.
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:17.060]   What?
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.420]   It just incites rage in me, I think.
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.420]   That's the big thing.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:20.820]   I'm trying not to be raging.
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:21.820]   Yeah.
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:30.300]   I'm trying to just be sanguine about the whole thing and just kind of understand.
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:34.780]   But those tweets, wow.
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:36.100]   Unprecedented.
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:37.100]   I love that.
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:38.740]   It's a shame they fixed that.
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:45.420]   You know, he tweeted the misspelling where he said that Chinese stole our drone and this
[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:52.700]   is unprecedented with an S came from an Android phone middle of the night next morning fixed
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:58.220]   from an iPhone confirming what many have long said, which is when Trump tweets.
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.780]   It's usually late at night from an Android device.
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:06.580]   And when his staff tweets, it's the next morning on an iPhone.
[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:10.860]   Just a little, you know, it's helpful to have these glosses to understand better what's
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:12.260]   going on.
[02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:14.420]   It's unprecedented.
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:15.580]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:16.580]   We do.
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:17.580]   This is our last Twitter 2016.
[02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:21.940]   We'll be back January 8th, but there will be fresh tweets for you next week.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:27.340]   We're going to do a holiday seasonal twit where we get some of our favorite hosts in the
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:31.580]   studio that aren't normally in studio Steve Gibson, Denise Howell, Renee Richie.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:34.500]   And we'll talk about all the big tech stories of 2016.
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:37.540]   And then the following week, our best up, thanks to you.
[02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:41.740]   We've been, you've been submitting all these great bits from the previous episodes.
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:47.140]   We've edited them together into a fun couple of hours of the best of twit 2016.
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:48.140]   That'll be.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:50.660]   Tell me they have you with the plants.
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:53.500]   Oh, I think they start with that.
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:55.620]   I mean, where I got naked.
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:56.620]   Yeah.
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:57.780]   You were there for that.
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:12:59.460]   That was so great.
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:00.620]   That was so great.
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:01.620]   That was the funniest thing.
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:03.620]   That's one word for it.
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:06.420]   No, I didn't mean that insulting.
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:07.420]   It was just.
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:14.620]   It was definitely unpresidential.
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:19.460]   So yes, that's going to be on that New Year's Day, Christmas Day, of course, is the holiday
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:22.100]   show and we'll be back January 8th without a fresh twit.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:23.580]   In fact, we'll be talking about CES.
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:27.420]   We'll get some people who are at CES because believe it or not, yes, it's CES time once
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:28.660]   again.
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:33.100]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300 UTC.
[02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:37.260]   If you want to join us live on the stream live and studio, just email tickets at twit.tv
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:39.180]   We love having a live studio audience.
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:43.140]   And of course, in our chatroom at irc.twit.tv.
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:50.020]   After the fact, our shows are available on demand at twit.tv on youtube.com/twit.
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:54.860]   And of course, everywhere you get podcasts, we have audio and video for you.
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:55.860]   And it'd be great.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:14:01.420]   It would make me very happy if you would subscribe because I tell you what, the show is interesting
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:02.420]   every week.
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:05.740]   And I know it's long, but you can take your time listening to it if you download it and
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:06.740]   listen.
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:07.980]   Thank you for being here.
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:13.940]   Have a great holiday, happy new year, and I'll see you January 8th.
[02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:15.900]   Another twit is in the camera.
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:16.900]   It's amazing.
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:17.900]   Do the twit.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:18.900]   Do the twit.
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:19.900]   All right.
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:20.900]   Do the twit, baby.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.900]   Do the twit.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.900]   All right.
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:23.900]   Do the twit.
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:24.900]   All right.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:24.900]   Do the twit.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:26.100]   Do it in the twin.
