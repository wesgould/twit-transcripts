[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.200]   Show where we cover the week's tech news. Great panel for you. We brought in the
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.520]   heavy hitters. The smart guys. Start with Tim Stevens. He is from CNET but also from
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.160]   a brand new publication on CNET. Congratulations on the road show. Thank
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.080]   you Leo. Yeah we just launched that at the Detroit Auto Show this week and it's
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320]   been a great first week. We're really excited to have it out there in the wild and public
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.640]   eyes finally. Timing couldn't be better. Everybody's very interested in autonomous
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   vehicles. What's going on with cars. I mean it really isn't. It's not any more you
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.120]   know you want to core veteran Mustang. It's really gotten to be very interesting.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.560]   Almost a consumer electronics subject these days. Absolutely. Yeah we're seeing more and
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.680]   more studies that show that people are making buying decisions about cars more
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.960]   about what their phones can do with their cars than what's under the hood. So you
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.120]   know we're trying to try to do our best to bring that information to the readers.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.320]   Well somebody else who's very interested in all of this. He joins us from Taiwan.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.920]   Ben Thompson of Stratecory.com and the Exponent FM podcast. Hey Ben good morning.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   Good morning. How early is it? It is 7 a.m. Oh it's not that bad. You could you
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.160]   normally get up at this hour no doubt. Yes. White cold bloggers do.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.600]   Bloggers love getting up. See the sunrise. It's a you know it's better now because
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.520]   during days I was I'm after week about six. I it's right six. I winter is easier.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.440]   Well welcome. I'm so glad you make the time for us because we really love your
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.720]   input. Also joining us and we're thrilled to have him Steve Kovac. He is from
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   Business Insider but he's now deputy editor of their newest publication Tech
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.400]   Insider Tech Insider.io. Last time you were here you were just getting that
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.840]   started. It's going well. Yeah we're I think we're six months in now and yeah
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.120]   everything's chugging along. It's really impressive. We just finished our first
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   CES and now we're gonna do some big things for first full year out there. So
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.440]   I'm really excited. And it is a wide ranging. Well the best pizza place in
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.760]   New York City. Here's what gravitational waves are and how they could change
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.960]   physics forever. And mix of stuff. It's a mix. Lake Erie can get extremely violent
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.720]   and hear the photos to prove it. The sexiest doctor alive. It's really a wide
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.080]   ranging. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot of digital culture. That's what the
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.400]   Instagram doctor guy is. Yeah. I'm in charge of just the nuts and bolts gadget
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.680]   and app coverage. But you know we're pretty diversified and you know the whole
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.360]   idea here is to cover things. The broad theme of the site is innovation and
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.720]   and what technology enables us to do. And so that hot doctor wouldn't exist
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   without Instagram. That's true. So it's a kind of a different approach to
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.200]   technology journalism I think. I was looking at I Justine's feed the other
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.800]   day. And we love I Justine. She kind of got her starter on this network. You
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.000]   know and I've watched with great pride and interest in her success. But man I
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   mean it's interesting to watch your Instagram feed. The most recent one is
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.400]   her jumping in the air and there are a lot of them like that. I think 20,000
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   likes. Yeah. And it's immediately to immediately. Did you see the video of
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   the what was that of the guy? It's notifications. Oh yeah. It just blows
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.880]   up his home screen. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. And that's why if you're an
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.560]   Instagram star you never turn on a lock screen notifications. Oh, it just
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.360]   whizzes by. I'm gonna have to see if I can find that. I can't remember what he
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.560]   he was a it was a sports thing like NFL or something. How he was famous but
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.800]   we posted it on the site too. I was just blown away by that. I didn't know the
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.160]   iPhone could do that. Yeah. This is what 8 million Instagram followers does to
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:22.840]   your notifications. Take a look. Can you see me? You can't see me? You see me.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.400]   There we go. Look at that. I didn't even know the iPhone could do notifications
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.440]   that fast. Look at the TV. That's watching my notifications flow in. Wow.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.880]   Those are all likes. Jiminy Christmas. So you did have a story that is more
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.720]   probably more important than how many Instagram likes. By the way, it said it's
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.080]   a demeaned as you who runs a soccer focused Instagram account at 433. I've
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.120]   never heard of it. But if I guess if you're a soccer or football fan you would
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.560]   know. SpaceX had a launch and attempted landing today that failed. We should
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.880]   mention they were trying to do what they had already done once before which is
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:15.240]   land the first stage. No, one of the stages successfully so it could be
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.880]   reused. Unfortunately, in this case apparently one of the struts snapped. We
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.760]   weren't able to watch the video. The video feed from the barge failed.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:31.080]   They're going to put it up later. Musk said the residual pieces of the crash.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.280]   Elon Musk, we're talking about the founder of SpaceX, are bigger this time compared to the
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:41.480]   first two similar landing attempts last year. But from the looks of it, at least some of it survived.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.120]   And of course, this is important to SpaceX and to SpaceX in general because one of the big
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.560]   costs of launches is that these rockets are one-time use and they've landed the sea and they're
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.960]   gone and they're very expensive to build. The last fair landing that they had blew up
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.160]   rather spectacularly looks like this one just got settled over. So that's an
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.960]   improvement. But the one success that they did have was on solid ground. They're still trying to do
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   the drone ship landing thing successfully. They haven't managed to pull that off just yet.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.000]   If they can do that, then they can do that in California, which is what they want to do.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.480]   So we'll have to wait and see. But I guess it was somewhat rough seas today, which probably
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.280]   didn't help matters at all. Well, and also there is a little bit of
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   buying between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk because Jeff Bezos was a blue or blue
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:40.840]   sky. Blue origin. Blue origin did successfully land one of its stages. And so there's, you know,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.760]   this is kind of, they're measuring. It's okay. A little competition is good in civilian space.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.880]   Actually, we talked yesterday on the new screen savers Jason Calicanis was my co-host about Elon's
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.200]   plan to provide global internet with some huge number of low-Earth orbit satellites.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.720]   And he had to, Jason pointed out, well, one of the reasons he can even contemplate this is he
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:10.440]   happens to own a rocket company. So maybe there is some sense in launching this. What was it?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   How many was it? Was it 400, 500 low-Earth orbit? All right, let's get back to the topic at hand.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.000]   You didn't go to CES. Tim was at CES. Ben, you didn't go to CES.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.120]   I was there. I was very happy. I was very happy staying here. Yeah.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.280]   Sorry, you got Computex. You got other stuff to do. But you went, you went, Steve.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.480]   Yeah, actually, I saw Tim there at the Faraday future keynote thing.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.360]   Faraday is one of the electric cars, kind of a new one in the business. They showed off a concept car.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.520]   How? Well, deal. What? That overreel. Ben, how you look at it? Yeah.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.080]   Faraday has yet to actually show any real product, right? But are they, what do you think, Tim?
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   Are they credible? They've definitely got a lot of funding. That was one of the big things that
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.440]   they talked about at the event at CES. Was there the backing from LED TV, which is a major Chinese
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.320]   media conglomerate worth billions of dollars? They've invested somewhere around a billion dollars to
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.120]   get this company Faraday future off the ground. So they definitely got some strong backing and
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.840]   they have started, they're about to start construction on a battery factory just outside of Las Vegas.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.640]   So that was another part of the big announcement. They're making at CES. But the big thing that
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.480]   we wanted to see was some kind of a production based car or something that would be, that we
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.960]   could actually see and sit in and get driven around in and actually track the course of this
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.720]   company towards some kind of a product that you and I could actually think about buying.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.480]   But instead they rolled out this crazy concept car thing, an autonomous
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.160]   thousand horsepower four wheel drive, electric hypercar thing, which was just a hollow shell,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.880]   certainly nothing that would ever go into production. And that was pretty disappointing because everyone
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.000]   can drive cool sketches and have lots of fun, but to actually make a production ready car that
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.520]   can pass all the crash regulations and everything else that you need to get on the road,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.920]   that's a much more complicated thing. And so that's still a big question mark in my mind and a lot
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.600]   of other people's minds as well. Yeah, when you go to these websites in Faraday Futures,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   a really classic one, and it's very, very, very blue sky. What if we could redefine our
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.640]   relationship with the automobile? I always makes me a little suspect of the whole thing. But they
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:27.800]   got money. They got venture capital. You, you wrote it recently, actually been your most recent
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:37.480]   post on Stratecary was about autonomous vehicles. Ben would love to respond, but we've had to.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.840]   We lost him. Yeah. They're rebooting his computer. I should have looked over and noted that. All
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.200]   right, we'll get John is writing you a note right now to say Ben is lost.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.280]   Well, let's talk about the Detroit Auto Show. Because that's one of the things that you see at
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:12:00.120]   CES is, of course, the consumer electronics aspect of automobiles, the high tech inside.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.880]   Is it the same at the Detroit Auto Show these days, or is it more traditional?
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.080]   It's definitely more traditional. We're seeing CES become the platform for these major
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.840]   manufacturers to make big announcements about their consumer electronics integrations,
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.560]   car play announcements, GM announced their $500 million investment in Lyft, for example.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.480]   Those are stories that really wouldn't play as well in Detroit. Detroit is a
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.920]   traditional automotive show with a lot of traditional automotive journalists there.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.280]   They want to see new cars. They want to see new sheet metal talk about new engines, that kind of
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.120]   thing. So partnerships with Silicon Valley and infotainment integrations and things like that just
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.880]   really would kind of get buried amongst other noise within new models being unveiled in Detroit.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.160]   So we're seeing GM and Ford and other manufacturers have kind of a smart cadence. So they'll go to
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.840]   CES. They'll talk about their technology stories. They'll talk that up and they'll get a good
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.640]   buzz going into Detroit where they'll show off the actual car. So Mercedes did that very well this
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.560]   year as well. They showed off the E-Type at CES. They did some demonstrations of the autonomous
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.960]   functionality, the self-driving functionality of that car. And then you get to Detroit and you
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.360]   actually see the car itself. So that was a nice way to transition from one show to the next.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.680]   I love it. Corning was there with Gorilla Glass for car windshields. They showed it on the Ford GT.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:20.440]   Ryan Seacrest was there for the demonstrations of, well, he was there talking at the Ford event
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.920]   and then he went to the Ford booth and people got to shoot hills at, hillstones at him through
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.560]   nice. I should have gone.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.920]   Darn.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.240]   The year we actually got to be here, that it was pretty.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.040]   Oh, God.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.320]   Pretty exciting.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.480]   Okay, calm down. I think.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.600]   I'm not sure what it is.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:19.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:24.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.720]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:29.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:35.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:37.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.400]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   I'm
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:55.560]   But it's good to see that corporations are making
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.400]   that level of interest.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.200]   They're trying to not being totally transparent or as open as you might expect.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   Someone like Google to be, for example, but they are being a little bit more transparent.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.080]   They're learning.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.640]   You talk a little bit about Audi is doing a hydrogen-fueled.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.240]   It's a concept car, but this is a different kind of electric car.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.760]   Right.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.400]   So you know, you're typical EV, you're Tesla, that kind of thing.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.760]   Has electric motors powering the wheels and then the electricity comes from a battery.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.960]   A hydrogen-powered car is actually pretty much the same thing,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.520]   except the battery pack is a lot smaller and there is an additional hydrogen tank on board
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.720]   plus a fuel cell stack.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.320]   So instead of the electricity coming exclusively from the battery,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.240]   the electricity can come through this fuel cell stack, which is powered by hydrogen.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.440]   The only emissions from the car would be basically water, which is not the bad for the environment.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.760]   And you get much quicker refueling.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.240]   You can refuel a fuel cell powered car in about four minutes, so roughly the same time as you
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.840]   can refuel a gasoline-powered car.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.320]   And again, you can have all the range of a gas-powered car and all the power and everything else too.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.760]   The problem, of course, is you can't go to your local
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.280]   corner gas station and get a tank full of hydrogen, at least not yet.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.920]   But both Audi had the H-Tron car there, which is pretty cool.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.560]   It also has some kind of fancy high-tech stuff like pop-out chrome mirrors and offenders.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.000]   Instead of having actual mirrors, they're just digital cameras that point backwards, which is nice.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.360]   I think that's really interesting.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.040]   We've seen other cars doing that too with the...
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.120]   Who is it that rear-view mirror that was just a camera view?
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.000]   What a great idea.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.760]   Chevy's actually replaced or has augmented the Bolt.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.320]   That was the Bolt.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.720]   A rear-view mirror with a camera.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.040]   So that gets a 120-degree wide-angle view at the rear rather than just using a mirror.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   But in the US, you cannot actually get rid of at least the driver side mirror has to be a proper
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.040]   mirror. So digital rear-view mirrors, which are much more aerodynamic than things hanging out
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.440]   of your door, are not legal in the US yet.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.840]   That's something that manufacturers are trying to change.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   But Chevy kind of got around that by building the mirror into an LCD panel that sits behind
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.640]   the actual mirror.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.160]   So if the LCD would go out for any reason, it works just like an old-school
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.280]   mirror. But when you flip on the system, you get the digital camera view at the back,
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.720]   which is a pretty smart way to get around the legislation as it works.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:12.520]   Is that the concern of legislators' safety that a video tap might not be as reliable as a physical
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:12.840]   mirror?
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.280]   I think that's part of why that law still exists.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.800]   But ultimately, it exists because back in the day, there simply was no alternative.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.280]   And they wanted to legislate that there had to be a mirror.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.720]   So the simply stated that a physical mirror had to be on the car.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.560]   It wasn't to prevent cameras. It was because there weren't any...
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.000]   There wasn't anything like that.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.960]   That's one of these things that's getting really, unfortunately,
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.560]   confusing as manufacturers are trying to go forward with autonomous functionality.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.840]   BMW, for example, in Europe, you could park your new seven-series by getting out of the car
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.720]   and hitting a button on the remote control. The car would then pull itself in your garage,
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.080]   and you wouldn't have to do anything.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.440]   But in the US, BMW did disable that functionality because the law in certain states in the US
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.840]   says that you must, to put the car into park, you must physically depress the brake pedal
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.440]   before putting it into park. And BMW said, "Well, you can't do that if we're not in the car,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.000]   so therefore we can't disable that functionality."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.960]   But of course, Tesla added that functionality just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.840]   and the new eClass from Mercedes will do the same thing.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.960]   They took the interpretation that the brake pedal simply had to be pressed.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.320]   It didn't matter how it was pressed.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.560]   And that's one of those annoying things where it's up for interpretation,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.640]   and different manufacturers are interpreting it in different ways.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.720]   And that's one of the reasons that we saw that the Department of Transportation
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.320]   making a big statement just last week, that they're going to try to work to
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.960]   standardize a lot of these laws and everything to make the US a more friendly place for autonomous
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.680]   research, and things like that, which is very encouraging.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.920]   Yet Tesla also announced a fetch mode where you can actually say to your car, park in the garage,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.720]   the car parks itself, and then you go out your front door and say, "Come
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.120]   here car," and it comes and gets you the next day.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.160]   Yeah, which is great if your garage has just enough room to fit a car and nothing else.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.880]   That certainly means you want to spend much time cleaning your garage,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.360]   but certainly it'll make cars easier to park.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.160]   That's really interesting. Is it reliable? Have you tried it?
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.880]   We haven't had a chance to try it yet, no. But BMW and Mercedes-Benz both assume
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   my functionalities. The Mercedes app is part of this also,
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.760]   that you always must maintain control of the car to be basically, well, to show
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.640]   that you are in control of the car to be driving the car, and that was another part of the
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.720]   legislation that BMW was concerned about. The way that Mercedes is getting around that is
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.960]   you run an app on your smartphone, and so as you're backing up your car, you have to run your
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   finger in a circle on the app. So basically, you continue to make a move.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.840]   I'm in control. If you take your finger off the app, the car stops immediately.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.520]   That way you're demonstrating control of the car without actually physically being in the car.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.120]   That's some form of driving.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.560]   Insilly games and things like that.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.120]   I'm in control.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.360]   I'm not interested in anything here.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.600]   Wow. Yeah, actually, the only time I've used any autonomous functions,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.720]   I was at the Ford test track. This was some years ago. We actually, unfortunately,
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.880]   have this on camera, and they were demonstrating their self-park feature, and they said,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.320]   "Okay, you're driving through town." Thank goodness this was on the test track.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.800]   I was in a big old flex, and they said, "Okay, you're looking for a parking space.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.200]   So press that button. The car continues to drive, and then it beeps at you. Oh, here's a spot.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.240]   I could fit. It's a big car, so that's good." And then you said, "Okay." They said, "Go, park it."
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.160]   And so I pressed the other button, and they said, "Take your hands off the wheels,
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   feed off the pedals. It's going to park itself." It's cool. The thing spins around and stuff.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.200]   What they don't tell you, and I think they did it on purpose, is maybe now I'm thinking there's a
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:33.960]   whole plan here, is once it parks, put your feet back on the brake and turn off the ignition,
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.200]   because I didn't, and it continued to idle backwards into the car, and behind me, it went bam.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.040]   And now I'm thinking, "Oh, they were trying to, they do this because they were engineers in this car
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.880]   laughing at me." I think this is their way of lobbying state legislatures to take that rule off
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.040]   that you have to have somebody with a foot on the brake, because it should just say, "I'm parked."
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.600]   Yeah, absolutely. Especially now that you don't have to have any physical linkage between
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.040]   yourself and the transmission, the transmission is going to shift themselves. Cars can steer
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.800]   themselves. Now there's no more mechanical steering. I'm driving by wire anyway. Yeah.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.160]   Absolutely. So there's a lot of old laws hanging around that ultimately are making these engineering
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.240]   decisions more difficult than they need to be. And as part of what that program from the DOT
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.360]   is going to try to go through to iron out all these. You can test autonomous cars in four states
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.600]   in the US right now, and I think Virginia is coming out, it'll be number five. But that's it.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   There are certainly a lot of places and a lot of opportunities to be testing these cars in other
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.280]   states in the US. And if you have to pick and choose like that, it's going to make it more difficult
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.680]   to be a leader in that area. And autonomy is going to be a huge industry for these
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.440]   auto manufacturers. And if they can't test these things efficiently in every state in the US,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.880]   that's going to be a major issue for them going forward. So I hope that this really helps to
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.280]   have a stable platform across the US for laws that are progressive enough to enable this kind
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.960]   of technology and to enable us to continue to be leaders in the automotive space.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.800]   And Thompson, you wrote about this in Stratecary. In fact, you said that for your money,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.480]   the most interesting news out of CES was from General Motors.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.760]   Yeah, sorry, I got disconnected.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.640]   Yeah, we got you back.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:14.440]   If I recover any points. But, well, I think that was a nice hook.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:25.080]   I think I'm personally a little skeptical about the bolt, specifically. I think the challenge,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:36.680]   when it comes to low-cost electric is what you're buying as a, someone buying a $30,000 car is very
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.080]   different than what you're looking for in a purchase in a, you mentioned that you were
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.720]   acquiring a Tesla in a $100,000 car, $9,000 car.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.200]   Particularly today.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.120]   Is it because it's more expensive to do it right?
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:56.760]   Well, first off, I mean, the upfront cost is going to be more. And there's plenty of evidence
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.320]   that customers anchor on the upfront cost more than the total cost of ownership.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   To the total cost of ownership of an internal combustion engine powered car right now is as
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.160]   low as it's been in a long time. It's going to be for, and it will say it's going to be that
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.840]   way for a while because of the low oil prices. And then three, I think an underappreciated part is
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:26.040]   people who are buying a Tesla, if they want to go to grandma's house, they can say,
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:33.960]   oh, we'll just take the BMW instead, right? Where as someone buying a $30,000 car with subsidies,
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.520]   one, they probably don't have an alternative car, two, they're definitely not going to fly,
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.880]   right? They can't drop, you know, $2,500 on the full whole family of plane tickets.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:53.960]   And so the pure driving performance issue, a.k.a. range of electrics is much more of a
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:00.280]   limiting factor, I think, for the lower you go on the income scale. On the flip side,
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:06.040]   the bull's not going to really, unless it gets some sort of Prius or a confer, some sort of status
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.240]   on you that no question having a Tesla does, you only need to go down to the value.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.400]   That's why I'm buying it. I just want the status. I don't really care.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:20.360]   I mean, you say that with the smirking tone to hide the truth.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.720]   Yes, which is that I do.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.840]   Which is that it's totally the case. No, you know, I want to Tesla because I want the highest
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.960]   tech vehicle out there just to try it, just to see. I'm actually was very tempted with the
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.320]   bolt. I thought that looked pretty good. 200 mile range, Tesla's not hugely more. I think it's 350.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.640]   Sure. But selling the people who are interested in the taxes to try it isn't a particularly large
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.680]   no, no, that's not such a tiny market. So I grant you that.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:55.960]   Yeah, I think this is a very narrow point, but I guess I'm no auto expert like Tim or anyone else
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.840]   in the space. But I think just looking at kind of the market, the characteristics of the market for
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.440]   a car like the bolt, we'll see. We'll see. I think big picture. I think that what I was trying to do
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.320]   with my piece this week was really, or we're talking about cars are changing, there's cars and
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:17.240]   there's constantly, but there's really very distinct axes that it's changing on. And I think
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.680]   you're kind of interpretation of what's happening varies based on what you look at. The three being,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:29.240]   you know, the electrification. Number two being self driving, number three being the changing
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.320]   nature of transportation, which is from individually owned and operated vehicles to
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   right transportation as a service. And that may throw everything up in the air because,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:43.800]   you know, these cars, these companies are built around the notion of private personal car ownership.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.120]   Well, I thought it was very interesting as you point out that as well as announcing the bolt,
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:54.040]   GM announced a half billion dollar investment in Lyft. And you don't invest in Lyft as a
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.760]   ride service. You're not buying a taxi company. You're buying it. It's not really about ride
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.320]   sharing. It's in my opinion, both Uber and Lyft are really about the future of car ownership.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:10.280]   And they're hedging their bets in effect. Right. Well, I mean, frankly, if
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.600]   transportation as a service becomes the dominant form of transportation, I mean,
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.880]   all the existing car manufacturers are in trouble, not because we won't need cars, we will,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.880]   but because the nature of what we need a car for will change.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.840]   How does it change their businesses? I actually haven't really, I'm sure you've crunched the numbers.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.680]   They sell a lot fewer cars because we're not all owning individual owning.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.080]   Not necessarily because I mean, if the number, it's hard to know how the number of
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:46.200]   miles driven will change. But I mean, presumably, if we are all using Uber's and lists in the future,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.280]   the cars that are used to Uber and Lyft are going to need to be replaced far more frequently.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.160]   I mean, just the wear and tears. So it's still a business for them.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:58.760]   Right. But the difference is you're not buying a $90,000 car because it makes you feel good about
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.000]   yourself. It's all a fleet of her environment.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.960]   Yeah. Right. I spoke with Mark Fields, who's the CEO of Ford in Detroit this past weekend.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   Everyone's asking that question. It's Ford, basically is Ford screwed if everyone just goes
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.640]   into car sharing and stops buying cars. And his response was pretty interesting, which I'd
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.040]   I never heard before. He says that the personal transportation industry, I.e. the car industry,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.000]   is about a $2. Something trillion industry. They said the mass transportation industry
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.520]   was if something like a 5. something trillion dollar industry. And right now, the auto industry
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.920]   has no share of that whatsoever. And he said, worst case, if they need to transition to being
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.160]   something more of a mass transit, something more of a not quite an authority, but in that area,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.560]   that's actually a huge new market for them to tap into. Obviously, it's going to take a lot of
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.200]   change for them to be able to capitalize on that. But with that investment from GM
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.960]   into Lyft and with Ford's smart mobility program, they're definitely looking in that direction.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.840]   And they see, they see the writing as much as anybody. And Mark Fields, at least, is confident
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.840]   they can pivot in that direction. Of course, he would be. But that was an interesting angle,
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.760]   I thought, of that, of that, of that problem. Well, and, you know, I also have been talking.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:11.080]   Of course, you would be being the CEO. Sure. Of course. But, but no, I've also been talking
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.520]   to Ford since before, Mark to Alan Malawi, as I know you have. And it's really, they have been
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.480]   fairly aware of this. And it, by the way, these are the exact changes we've seen technology
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:29.000]   as a havoc technology has wreaked on a lot of industries. But this is a giant industry and a huge
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.320]   economic driver in the United States. So I think there's a lot, you know, there's concern
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   about what this might portend. Well, that's something that's interesting. What Faraday
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:44.200]   Future has told, has told our reporter a couple of weeks ago, they don't see it like in the long
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.480]   term view, you know, in the short term in four or five years, they'll have a car that you can buy,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:52.200]   it'll be like another Tesla type thing. But 10, 15, 20 years, they're going for that
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.840]   services thing too. They see it as like a subscription service, you pay a fee, and they
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.000]   deliver you whatever car when you need it. So if you need a truck to, you know, pick up furniture
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.680]   from Ikea, you get that. Excuse me. And if you need, you know, just a one man vehicle just to get
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.360]   you to work for the day, you get that and that's what comes to you. So it's kind of like,
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.960]   almost like Spotify, but for cars, you know, you get the thing that you need when you need it.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.400]   And then you don't own the car. I do have to think that that reduces the amount of sales,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.920]   because really, there are a lot of cars in this country that are not being driven. I mean,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.040]   that's how Uber X and Lyft started was this notion there's a lot of cars just sitting around,
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.400]   because, you know, people drive to work and then the other cars sitting in the garage or whatever.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:40.120]   I mean, who are not going where they want to or who are going where they want to in a way that
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.200]   they would rather not, you know, there are certainly people who aren't unable to drive anymore and
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.760]   who are relying on public hands that can't wait for. Yeah. And you know, people who are younger
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   than 16 who want to be able to get somewhere or parents of people who are younger than 16 who
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.440]   want to have their kids get to school without or the band practice or whatever. No, I think it's
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.560]   just a matter of time before they invent a thing that you as long as you're playing Candy Crush
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.680]   Saga, the car continues to move forward. And I think that that's actually right. Yeah,
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.240]   that's actually the solution right there. No, I'm sorry, I'm being facetious. This is exactly why
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:18.440]   I think it's useful to tease these things apart because it's trivial to sit here and imagine what
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.600]   the future will look like. The real trick and analysis, particularly when it comes to the technology
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   related is figuring out the timing. So yeah, maybe one day I can order whatever car I want to my door
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.800]   and come up. But as much as Faraday wants to break about their funding, I have to see the funding
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.600]   that guarantees they'll get to that date and they'll be in place to do it. Call me pretty skeptical.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.920]   I'm always comfortable with you. Well, the the and this is where it gets into. I mean,
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:51.480]   you know, something that has has gotten criticism over the last couple of years as and in part for me,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.560]   but is the idea of disruption. But I think it's actually a very useful thing to think about in
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:05.320]   this case in that when it comes to electrification, for example, or these fetch my car or park in my
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   garage, the things you were talking about earlier, I mean, these are very much sustaining sort of
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.560]   innovations in which in which case we should expect the existing manufacturers to take advantage of
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.760]   them. And if you want to enter the market, you're likely you're going to have to take a tactic like
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.520]   Tesla where Tesla is coming at the high end. They're offering something they're going over the top
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:32.600]   on features. They're going over the top on status and brand. And really, that's, you know, there's a
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.520]   reason why there have been very few new entrances to the car market over the last 100 years because
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:45.240]   it's it's a hard thing to break into. On on the flip side, disruption is not about people use the
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.280]   word disruption for everything, right? But disruption is about business models first and foremost.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:57.720]   And what happens with something like like in Uber, where you no longer buy a car, you just use one
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:04.600]   when you need it, that is a new business model. And what is scary about disruption is it doesn't
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.800]   matter that Mark Fields can see it coming. It doesn't matter that GM can see it coming.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.840]   What will happen to them will be almost completely out of their control. And maybe they will survive
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.320]   in some fashion or maybe they won't, or maybe it won't happen at all. But the entire point of
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.400]   disruption in which kind of makes it ironic is that the brilliant insight of disruption is that
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.000]   incumbents can't really do anything about it. And then now there's a whole consulting practice
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.560]   on helping incumbent companies do a disruption, which should. And we have such a template for
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.320]   this. We've seen it happen so many times in so many industries. Well, I mean, what happens is
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.720]   once you get to a world where people don't buy their own cars, they're all fleet sales, like,
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.800]   I'm sorry, but for it, innovate all you want, but your business has fundamentally changed and
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.840]   almost certainly in a less favorable direction, because you're giving up all the angles on which
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.600]   you sell differentiated cars. It's going to buy undercoating if it's fleet purchases.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.040]   Yeah, I mean, there's lots of stuff like that. I mean, now, now, again, there's a timing issue
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.440]   here. I mean, it's very easy to say that, you know, the US sold a record number of cars,
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.000]   that's your 17 for 5 billion cars. That's 17.5 billion new reasons to not take an Uber.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.560]   So by no means the timing is clear, but what makes Uber particularly interesting from my perspective
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:24.520]   is that Uber uses today's cars with today's driving systems, a.k.a. humans.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:31.720]   And everything about Uber uses today's existing technologies, but with tomorrow's business model.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.640]   And so that's interesting because as these technologies come online, like Uber is actually
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.480]   very well placed to acquire them or build themselves, all these sorts of things. People want to
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   talk about Google and all this sort of thing. Google is going for this home run multi bank
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.800]   shot approach where magically their system will work. You know, be regulatory approved and people
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.680]   will accept it all at the same time. And that's not usually how technology change happens.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:03.720]   And so we'll see. I mean, you see the younger generation. I mean,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:10.760]   the analogy I made was two TV. What happened, people have been predicting cord cutting for ages.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.800]   And it hasn't happened because people like their cable bundle. And there's lots of reasons for that.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   There's very good reasons for that. However, the numbers are going down finally, but the reason
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:28.280]   they're going down is not to be morbid, but people are dying. And young people are not getting it
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.600]   for the first time. They're just they've grown up with tablets and the internet and all these
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:39.400]   sorts of things. And I suspect the same thing with cars. Us old people are attached to our cars.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:45.880]   We're going to stick with them till we die, probably in a car. And young people are going to come up
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.000]   who the idea of wasting a couple hours a day on anything other than their smartphone will make
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.200]   no sense to them. And that's when the shift will happen. Sorry, that was the long rant.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.920]   No, I think it's a it's exactly to the point because we're trying to figure out what the
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.880]   heck's going to happen. We're in a really weird interregnum where gas prices are going down,
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:10.440]   down, down. There's a gas glut and car sales are at record highs. But you know that that's
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.720]   that's not going to stay that way. Well, there's lots of actually reasons to suspect that they will.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   Really? There's been a massive technological breakthrough in oil extraction, which is fracking.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.880]   I mean, and it is it is lower the cost. It's opened up massive new resources for oil,
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:35.080]   which are not in, you know, despot controlled countries. It is it comes online and goes offline
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.040]   quickly. So it responds relatively quickly to market conditions. And yeah, I think there's
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:47.320]   there's secular reasons to expect that oil will stay lower for the for for a while,
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   which which again, but that's fine. I mean, the thing about electrification is it's interesting.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   It's a new technology. It theoretically allows some new companies to come in because you're
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:03.000]   moving the complexity of the drive train, but it's not changing the fundamental nature of what it
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.280]   means to have a car company and what it means to own a car. It's just it's like I picked a crappy
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.880]   time to give up the grid and buy an electric car. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:21.160]   solar panels on my house. Hey, you're doing good for the environment. Oh, that's right. That's why I'm doing it. Yeah.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.560]   Tim Stevens is here. You picked a good time to create a new show roadshow part of his CNET duties.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.680]   And it's what is the website, the roadshow either roadshow.com.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.000]   It's lots of reviews and videos and also other good stuff. Nice. Ben Thompson from
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.520]   Stratecary. If you could see by now, if you didn't know it already, that that is a must subscribe Stratecary.com.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:52.040]   And from techinsider.io brand new publication from Business Insider. It's great to have Steve
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:37:01.240]   Kofak. I think I want to talk a little bit about Bitcoin when we come back. There's lots to talk about, as always, this week. Our show today brought to you by Shipstation.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:12.760]   We know a lot of you have made hay in this new economy by selling online, by becoming an eBay seller or selling on Etsy or Amazon.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   But how do you ship? How do you do your fulfillment? You need to know about shipstation.com, the fastest, easiest way to manage and ship all your orders in one place.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:31.960]   shipstation.com. They can easily create shipping labels for all the top carriers, including, of course, UPS and FedEx.

[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:48.280]   Those same rates that in the past, only Fortune 500 companies could get ship internationally. Sure, they do at DHL. They got it all in one spot.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:58.600]   And it's really easy to import your customer orders from eBay, from Amazon, from Etsy, from, more than 50 popular marketplaces and shopping carts.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.560]   So it integrates right into your workflow. No wonder it's the number one choice of online sellers.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.400]   They have an incredible 98% satisfaction rating from their customers.

[00:38:50.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   Yay! I love empowering people to make their way in this new economy and just be glad you're not a big three automaker in the US.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.800]   Then you don't have to figure this stuff out. I hate to be in that position
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:16.680]   where the world is changing out from under you. And the history is that even though companies know this is coming, that they often can't figure out how to make the transition.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.840]   I do think there's an aspect where I use the armistennial quote in my article, which is the quote.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.040]   I love that quote!
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.840]   I know it's been overused lately. It's getting overexposed.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.760]   But how did you go bankrupt suddenly or two ways suddenly or gradually then suddenly?
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.880]   Boy, that was a rough three minutes for you.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.680]   But I do think-
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.920]   It's such a good quote though. I didn't know it was earned its timing away.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.280]   How did you go bankrupt? Two ways, gradually, then suddenly.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.320]   I do think there will be an aspect of that in autos and frankly in a lot of businesses.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.160]   I mean, I've been saying this will be the case for TV for a long time as well.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:03.240]   I think people get so hung up on the technology and you can see why a future makes more sense than the present.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.800]   And you can see that in TV where over the top video makes more sense.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:14.760]   You can see it in cars where having these autonomous cars that just drive around ferrying people around on demand makes more sense for all kinds of reasons.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:25.960]   But I think a mistake that technologists in particular make regularly is dramatically underestimating how difficult it is to-
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.400]   for that sort of change to happen.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.040]   I mean, you see this in technological products.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:41.240]   People are hesitant to change how they use a computer much less how they use a car or the fact they have $50,000 sitting in their garage.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.360]   Or all these sorts of things.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:51.240]   And so that's why I mentioned before it's going to be a generational sort of thing.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:41:02.840]   And so in the medium term, short to medium term, I suspect actually most car companies are going to continue to do better than we expect.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:08.680]   And so that's why I don't do stock picking for example.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.920]   Well, one, if I did, I would do it for my own profit.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:19.960]   But two, this is what makes it tricky is getting into the timing aspect of when this is going to come on.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:27.480]   And the other thing too, this is why the Apple car, I think it's easy to sit here and say the Apple car makes no sense because we're all going to be in a noober one day.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:34.440]   Well, that's like saying in 2001 that building an iPod makes no sense because we're all going to be using our phones one day.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.240]   Like that doesn't mean Apple shouldn't have made the iPod, for example.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.920]   If we actually still have 20 to 25 years of this paradigm, I have no idea.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.360]   I just do that number out there.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:50.200]   Then making something at the high end, maybe is not the worst idea.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.640]   Then again, if the paradigm is going to change in five years, it's a terrible idea.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:00.920]   And this is why you get paid the big bucks to be Tim Cook or whoever to make these sort of bets.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.720]   It's interesting because you have on the one hand the incumbents, the fords of the world trying to figure out how to survive.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.000]   And you have the new guys trying to figure out how to capitalize.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.600]   Here's Steve Kovac riding 85 miles an hour in a golf cart.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.840]   You know, we just don't know what's what is this the Arcomodo?
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.640]   Arcomodo, it's a street legal trike.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.920]   That's legal?
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.360]   Street, street legal. It's actually classified as a motorcycle.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   And it's all electric. It can crank up to I think 80 or 85, I forget what the top 85, I guess it is.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.400]   And like these guys told me something really profound though.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.320]   The founders of this company, when I was chatting with them, in between takes on this thing.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.840]   You look good in that.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:44.600]   Yeah, well, they said once if and when we do get to fully autonomous vehicles,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.800]   the vehicles are going to look more like that thing I'm riding around in and less like
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:57.560]   Model X or Model S or giant SUV because they don't need to withstand the impact for maturity or a bus or something
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.720]   because that's not going to be an issue anymore.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.280]   So vehicles get lighter, they get cheaper, they get
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:09.800]   more people have access to this kind of transportation and like it's a win for everyone now.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.960]   Does that mean that companies are going to make as much money off it?
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.880]   Probably not. Are they going to be able to sell a $100,000 Tesla anymore?
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.920]   Probably not.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   But it was just really interesting to think that, you know, in 20 or 30 years,
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:28.360]   our cars are going to look more like that and less like, you know, a typical Ford or a sedan or something.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:34.040]   Seen autonomous urban vehicles, Chevy had one a couple of years ago at CES.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.960]   I'm sure, Tim, you've seen more than that.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.920]   They look like just little personal capsules almost.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.040]   But I definitely would disagree with the notion that we won't have luxury cars in the future.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.120]   I mean, we have luxury everything now.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:51.160]   It doesn't, you know, we have luxury watches that cost more than cars and, you know,
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.520]   you don't really need to watch anymore.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.600]   Those things will definitely continue.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.880]   And, you know, I have a lot of issues with Orca Modo.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.560]   They've had some interesting practices.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.920]   They've been delayed many, many times.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.480]   That's not, that's a company that's got some interesting history there.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.360]   I'll leave it that.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.880]   But yeah, definitely once cars can avoid accidents better than we can,
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.440]   yeah, we can strip out a lot of the extraneous stuff in there.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.200]   And we can get rid of things like speed limits and, you know, driving licenses,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.840]   even at some point we won't even need, we won't even need those.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.400]   Right.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.240]   But, you know, as we try to chart the future of the car sharing economy,
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.480]   somebody's still got to build those cars and, you know,
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.560]   no one's better positioned than the big auto manufacturers at this point.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:35.720]   So if anything, we could make transportation something that's accessible to more and more people.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   That doesn't necessarily mean that these companies are going to go away.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.440]   That their businesses are going to shift drastically.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.800]   I think they all appreciate that.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.120]   But doesn't mean they're going to go away by anything.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.000]   Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.360]   Mike Hearn, who is an early mover in Bitcoin,
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:59.400]   I think, I think he left his job at Google to go to work for about five years ago as a Bitcoin
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.440]   developer, wrote an article that caused the price of Bitcoin to tumble three days ago on
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.720]   medium, the resolution of the Bitcoin experiment in which he says,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.680]   "I've sold all my Bitcoins and I think I have come to the inescapable conclusion that it has failed."
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.240]   Bitcoin is over.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.920]   He says, "The network is on the brink of technical collapse."
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.200]   He should know that.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.360]   But he sets these six points.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.160]   He says, "Think about it.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.040]   If you'd never heard about Bitcoin before, would you care about a payments network that
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:35.800]   one couldn't move your existing money, two had wildly unpredictable fees that were high and rising
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:41.960]   fast, three allowed buyers to take back payments they'd made after walking out of the store just
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.320]   by pressing a button?"
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.960]   He says, "If you aren't aware of this feature, that's because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it."
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.800]   And I think that was in response to large backlogs of Bitcoin transactions,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.240]   sometimes taking a full day.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:02.040]   And much of the Bitcoin mining now occurring in China, Jason Calican has told me he believed
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.640]   that was because a lot of the Bitcoin miners were kind of in power plants and coal plants and
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.040]   nuclear plants in China, where they could get tap into the electricity for free and avoid
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.240]   the real cost of Bitcoin mining, which is the cost of the electricity.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:20.840]   And finally, in which the companies and people building it were an open civil war.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:26.360]   Fred Wilson, AVC.com wrote a response and she said, "Well, it's just an opportunity for Bitcoin to
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.720]   transform itself and survive.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.760]   What do you think the future is of Bitcoin?"
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.880]   Ben, you probably covered this.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.720]   I've never seen Bitcoin as a real currency.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.520]   No, it's an experiment.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.160]   A commodity.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.200]   It's a commodity.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.040]   I mean, people trade it like a commodity. The fact that this guy wrote a medium post and
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.400]   that sent the price tanking.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.040]   I mean, you don't see that with the dollars.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.440]   I mean, if you can blog and change the value of the US dollar, that's what it's saying.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.120]   There's no army backing it. There's no government backing it.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.800]   Like this of the fees and transactions processes are just like all over the map.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:09.080]   And I just have never seen a convincing argument from all these people.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:14.840]   So, confality investing in these technologies that convinces me this can be a real currency.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:25.080]   I think that's actually kind of the rub here is I can't speak for most people in Silicon Valley,
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.760]   I can speak for I know where a few of them stand, including myself.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:36.120]   And I think that the value of Bitcoin actually is more interesting the less you think of it as
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:43.560]   currency. At a very fundamental level, what Bitcoin and the blockchain type technology allows
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.800]   is digital scarcity. The entire thing with digital is that it's infinitely copiable.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.880]   And that's interesting in some ways, but it's problematic in other ways,
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:57.400]   because the value of something digital immediately goes to zero, because there's an effectively
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:02.120]   infinite amount. Well, in the case of the blockchain, you can actually have something
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.960]   be digital and all the advantages that comes with that being instantly transferable,
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:13.720]   transparent, movable over the place, well, also being scarce. There can only be one of something.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:19.480]   And that was thought to be impossible. And what makes Bitcoin so interesting is that that made
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:25.560]   that possible. Now, that has all kinds of potential interesting applications, the most obvious one
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:32.200]   of which is to be used as a currency. And the way Bitcoin specifically works is the series of
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:41.320]   checks and balances, but interlocking incentives in which there has to be a monetary aspect to
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:48.440]   motivate miners to verify transactions, which enables the scarcity. And so there has to be a
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:55.800]   component of that to it. But a real open question is, with Bitcoin specifically,
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:03.480]   is the future as this sort of restricted amount of digital currency like gold, which is why there
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:09.800]   tends to be an overlap in people who support, say, a gold standard and that sort of approach
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:16.360]   to monetary policy and Bitcoin supporters, as opposed to fiat currency, which is government backed,
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:25.320]   is based, is not backed by gold. And there's a federal reserve and all those sorts of things.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.160]   Like, there's a reason why there's all these political angles that you've heard in relation
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.480]   to Bitcoin. It comes down to this question. And so the real civil war here is between the one side
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.760]   that believes in that aspect of it. Is it gets the federal reserve? Is it gets the sort of thing,
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:44.680]   wants it to be its own currency? And the other side that sees the technology and what it could
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:50.200]   potentially enable, and there needs to be changes made to the protocol to make that possible.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:56.040]   And there's just a fundamental division here. And so actually, I think the division, if anything,
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:02.600]   is probably more between Silicon Valley and kind of speculators.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:09.640]   Well, I would say Bitcoin true believers, I don't mean that pejoratively. I mean that where they see
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:20.520]   the original Satoshi document and writings were more in line with that sort of view.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.640]   I mean, he's very skeptical of things like the federal reserve. And he wanted to create an actual
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:32.680]   currency. And it's a fundamental philosophical divide. And so I think this division is real.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.240]   And I'm not sure how it will be resolved. I'm not that deep enough of the community to know,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.200]   but I'm deep enough to know that this, like when you get to a core question of what's the point,
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.720]   yes, there are like the future isn't out. It's fascinating though to watch.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.120]   Fortunately, I don't really have a dog. I think I have seven bitcoins somewhere,
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:57.720]   which means I at one point where they were worth more than $7,000 and they're now worth about two.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:04.920]   But I don't, I mean, it's free money as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, well, I mean, I think the,
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:13.240]   from my perspective, what I've written in the past is the, to the extent that Bitcoin is not
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.400]   viewed as money, the more interesting and valuable it becomes systematically.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.600]   And again, do you mean the technology of blockchain or?
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:27.480]   Well, both. I mean, I think there's, you know, I think that this is such a, this is because it
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.160]   doesn't come up like such a, I'm certain the blockchain ideas fascinating. There's a debate,
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:36.760]   you can you have Bitcoin in the pen of the blockchain? You know, a lot of it gets down to this question
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:43.720]   of sort of one thing that, again, I need a West pejorative term then like true believers, whatever,
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:48.200]   but like the true believers really hold it on is that there's no trust required in Bitcoin.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:54.520]   It's a trustless system. And I think what people forget and it's easy to lose sight of is
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:00.840]   all systems, all institutions that involve humans have some sort of structure to them.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:06.920]   The question is whether it's explicit or implicit and you're seeing that play out in Bitcoin right
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:13.400]   now. Like there is governance in Bitcoin. There are people who are in control and it turns out,
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:19.640]   as, as, as my current is finding out, that just because it seems like theoretically,
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.080]   there's no one in control doesn't mean that there isn't someone in control.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.880]   What this reminds me so much is the, the battles that happen in open source projects all the time.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:34.280]   Well, it reminds me, the company reminds me of is, is Zappos actually the, the shoe company that's
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.640]   doing their like, they're like, a whole lot. Oh, the whole lot. There's nobody in charge.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.800]   There's no hierarchy, which is your best work. Yeah. There's always like,
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:50.280]   you look at any sort of human institution, there are, there are, there are structures that will
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.920]   emerge. And the question is, do you want them to be planned? Like they are in most corporations,
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.480]   or do you want them to be, be implicit? And it's easy to say, oh, implicit and natural is all sort
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:05.640]   of good until you realize that's how things like you look at tech and you see how we have a
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:12.600]   diversity problem. And why is it that we managed to start companies and up being all male, white
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.960]   and Asians? Well, because we just, we just hired our friends and we got recommendations. Well, if,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:24.680]   I mean, unless you are explicit and planful, like that's what's going to happen. And again,
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.440]   there's, there's good things to you. Oh, we have a consistent culture. We all believe the same sort
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:36.680]   of thing. Well, and you, we all pull on the same order, like, okay, but like, there will always be
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:42.200]   structure in the question is it implicit? Is it explicit? And again, I think you're seeing that
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:49.240]   happen in Bitcoin, you see it happen everywhere. And on the other hand, there was a flower grown
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:55.080]   in space, Scott Kelly, with the first picture. Thank you, Twitter for sharing this momentous
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:01.800]   occasion with all of us of a space flower grown in the international space station. It's a zinnia,
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.200]   by the way, it's a little bit as we're not asking to eat that there's some of my favorite tweets are
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:11.000]   random things from the space station, like flowers and plants and YouTube videos too, right?
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.440]   Everything. Yeah, absolutely. Great. But then Chris Hadfield do a Boi YouTube video that I guess
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:22.680]   somehow uploaded from the, he did a full full album after that too. It was actually encouraging
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.360]   to see that flower blooming because they posted a picture, I think last week or two weeks ago,
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:30.520]   some of their other flowers and plants that were not looking very good. So that's actually
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.480]   pretty encouraging that that it's not just in the Martian that you can grow things.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.000]   It's, you know, it's funny that you say that because it's the first thing you think of is,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.560]   is Mark Watley growing right potatoes on Mars and scienceing the F out of this science.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:49.720]   I'm seeing the F out of it. We live in very, and very interesting times. If there's one thing that
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:55.800]   I get, I get out of doing this show is not only being an observer to this, but getting really
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:02.920]   smart people like Tim and Steve and to talk about it. And I just, I'm very, feel very fortunate.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.200]   We're going to take a little break, come back with more. Go ahead, Ben, if you want to drink
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.720]   some tea or some fine scotch. It's just like shows up occasionally.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:16.600]   I know it might literally be a frog. It's literally a frog and it's really,
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:24.760]   ladies and gentlemen, literally. Did I just title the show? Yeah. I think you did. Congratulations,
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:30.440]   our show that they brought to you by Carvinite online backup stuff happens.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:37.240]   And while it's unlikely that you'll be abandoned on Mars, it is true that your data could be
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:42.360]   disrupted. And if you're in business losing your data, it means could mean losing your business.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.440]   That's why a great backup plan is so important. You're planning for disaster. You wouldn't run a
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.720]   business without fire insurance. Get some data insurance from carbonite.com. One of the things
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:58.360]   it makes carbonite work is that you're not just backing up locally. You're backing up to the cloud.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:03.720]   So if there is a massive disaster, if there's a fire or a flood where somebody comes in and wipes
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.440]   your business out, just takes everything, you're not reliant on those backups that Joey from the
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:14.440]   mailroom stuck in the closet last week. You got stuff on the carbonite cloud automatic,
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:21.000]   continuous backup, no more downtime with carbonite cloud backup. Protect the files that keep your
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.120]   business running or your home running smoothly. One of them under no wonder more than a one and a
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:31.640]   half million homes and small businesses trust carbonite to backup their computers and servers.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.600]   Now I know a lot of you are geeks and say, well, I could easily do an r-sync to an Amazon web
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:45.080]   service S3 instance. And yes, you probably could. Would you rely on it? I think it's probably safer
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:50.280]   better to trust carbonite. And certainly there are a lot of people who aren't going to roll their
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   own who really need good backup. Try it free, carbonite.com. You don't need a credit card.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:01.080]   And in fact, if you use the offer code, tweet, you'll get two free bonus months if you decide to buy.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:09.880]   They've really got this nailed carbonite.com. The best online automatic full time cloud backup
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:19.960]   for you and your data at home or at off at work at carbonite.com. Let's see here. Google I/O has
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:26.040]   they dropped Sundar Pachai. I think it's just really fun now that it's not Larry Page anymore.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Google has made the tweet announcement that I/O is coming May 18th
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.800]   to 20th. Interestingly enough, and we're trying to figure out how they're going to do this,
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.520]   not at Moscone Center or a normal convention center, but at the Shoreline Amphitheater
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:47.640]   where Neil Young has his regular yearly bridge benefits where Carlos Santana plays,
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.520]   this is a concert venue. In fact, with a big lawn, I don't know how they're going to do a whole
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:58.040]   Google I/O there. Are they going to have, what are they going to have? It's all the side
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:02.520]   sessions that is our question mark. I mean, yeah, I'm sure you can do a keynote there.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:06.840]   Well, it is in Google's backyard. So we were thinking maybe they would send autonomous vehicles
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:13.080]   to get each and every visitor. There'll be a lot of vehicles. Just the technical
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:17.240]   and bicycles that they have that'll be. Yeah, just put some bicycles out front a couple of segues
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:24.200]   and just roll on over to the Google campus. I mean, it is, I'm actually super interested in this.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:29.160]   I mean, I, I, nothing to write per se, but I mean, just kind of speculating. I mean,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:35.800]   if they do really, if you, if you step back far enough, it wouldn't be a shock if Google scales,
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:43.400]   at least from my perspective, if Google scales back, they're sort of developer platform support
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:48.360]   sort of thing. I mean, for, for them, from a strategic perspective, particularly on Android,
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:52.840]   I mean, apps are a necessary thing that they need to be competitive, but it's not, it's not
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:59:01.800]   core business. Right. But that said, I mean, it's, it's, it's, like, it's, it's pretty important. So,
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:07.400]   this is really interesting. I'm very curious to see what happens with the rest of the program
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:13.800]   in schedule. And, and you know, what, obviously what, what it means. I think you could also make
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:18.600]   the case that those sessions could happen off site or purely online. You know, as long as you
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:22.680]   have the developers, or excuse me, the Google personnel talking about the new APIs and streaming
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:29.800]   that online and why do you have to go to Google? Yeah. Yeah. I think there's obviously a lot of
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.960]   value in people getting together Google I/O and actually seeing physical demonstrations of things,
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:38.360]   but presumably, you know, I think by and large, a lot of that's just there for the media to be
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.880]   able to write about what cool new things Google's up to. And maybe that's what this is turning more
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.480]   into. They have a big splashy keynote like they've had in the past. The media gets to go there and
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.080]   write about all the cool new things Google's up to. And then developers go back to their computers
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.600]   and learn all the valuable things that they need to do to build an extra generation of apps.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:56.680]   You know, again, the question, do they physically need to be there to make that happen?
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.280]   I think it gives you your for a Sergey Brind to parachute in.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.320]   Oh, I remember that. Yeah. The land on the roof of my scone.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.760]   It's great. Actually, he didn't do the parachuting. Did he?
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:14.040]   They had stunt guys. They had stunt. Right. Yeah. He was just there shooting it with his Google
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:20.200]   glass with her Google glass, by the way. Are we going to see more Google glass stuff? They
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:27.160]   supposedly have a new design. Yeah, it seems like 2.0. We might even see it in a couple months at I/O.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.840]   Does anybody want this?
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.960]   I think they're going to go. It's not going to try to kill your smartphone like they did at
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:39.400]   that first round. Not necessarily kill your smartphone, but become a consumer type gadget.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.520]   I think it's going to be an enterprise gadget and a industrial gadget. Kind of like the HoloLens
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.120]   is working on right now. I don't think it's going to be normal. People are going to go to the store
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.680]   and buy this thing. Yeah, it doesn't seem to have a place in the world of VR and AR because it's
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:57.720]   not really either of those. It's actually just a display over your eyebrow with a camera.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:07.960]   Well, I think it gets to that timing issue I talked about before. I pushed back against the
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:14.840]   way people instinctually lump VR and AR together. Again, maybe there's certainly technological
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.560]   connections, but I think a computer and a phone are the same thing as a console and a,
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.760]   or a better example, a console and a phone are basically the same thing as well. If you want to
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.920]   get technical about it. Well, but I do have to point out, but I know where you're going with this,
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.240]   and I'll let you go on, but I do have to point out there have been now some hybrid approaches
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:40.040]   where you're in your Oculus Rift, but you don't run into a table because it's in your real space
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.640]   and it shows up in your VR as a real obstacle. Sure. And that gets to the point that they are,
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.480]   they are technically similar or technically, I mean, there's some sort of thing image in your eyes.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:02:00.920]   Eyes are involved in, but the big difference is how you use them. And, and something like a VR
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:07.640]   thing like an Oculus, it's a, what I term a destination device. Like you make a decision,
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:13.320]   like I am going to use the the Rift now and you go and you put it on, and then you use the Rift,
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.520]   and then you finish and you take it off and then you move on. And there's a big vein
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.560]   in technology of this. That's where consoles fit, right? You go and you sit down and you play a
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.720]   complex game, a gaming device, you're saying? Well, I mean, or, well, no, not just gaming.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.600]   There's also movies, right? You sit down and you watch a movie and then you stop watching the movie.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:40.760]   And, and that's a very large and profitable space to be. But the, there's another space of
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.080]   technology, which I call accompanying technologies, things that are with you as you go about your
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.040]   day. And this is the reason why the smartphone is so dominant in such an important platform
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.920]   is not because we make an appointment to go use our smartphone. And the reason why Facebook is
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.080]   such a big deal is not because we say, Oh, I'm going to go use Facebook. Now it's four o'clock.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.320]   It's because they're, they're omnipresent. They're always with us and they're there when we need
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.240]   them. We can pull it up and I have three minutes in line and look at Facebook and play Candy Crush
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.520]   forever. That's what makes Candy Crush a very different sort of game than Call of Duty, right?
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.920]   One, you sit down to play Call of Duty. You don't like sit down. Oh, I'm going to block off a few
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.240]   hours tonight to play Candy Crush. You might end up spending a few hours, but the way you,
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.400]   the way in which you go about doing it, your posture as you do it is very different.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.360]   I think you might be making the same mistake though, that somebody who was in the, in the world of
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.960]   computing where it was a desktop computer and you said, you know, someday you'll have that in your
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.360]   pocket. They might say, Oh, that's crazy talk. Nobody wants to do that. A desktop computer is a
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.440]   destination device. No, what I'm saying is, I know what I'm saying is I think you're looking at current
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.080]   technology, maybe not what might be happening. No, I would know your, your, your, your, your,
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.360]   your miss hearing me. I'm actually, what I'm saying is AR is very different than VR.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:00.600]   Well, I agree with you on that. AR is more interesting in the long run to me,
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:05.560]   because AR is an accompanying technology. Like, so I actually think Google Glass is very interesting.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.160]   I think the timing was wrong and probably the tech wasn't righty in the way they approached
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:17.880]   them and I've been right. But the idea of having an augmented vision and, and the computer with you
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:24.680]   as you go through your day to day activities, that by definition, the market is much bigger
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.840]   from an attention perspective, from a time perspective, because it's all the time in your day.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.800]   And so my distinction is between AR and VR, which VR will be fine and interesting.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:42.920]   I think, I just, I think that AR in the long run will be bigger than VR simply because it's, it's,
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.600]   yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it makes sense. But will VR continue where you're isolated from
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.880]   your environment? Will that kind of VR continue? You could have like the, what's, what's the up,
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:57.160]   you know, or yeah, no, Wally, in sort of sort of scenario where people just live in VR.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:02.600]   I wouldn't mind. I'll do that. I mean, bring me a quick and a batch of fries and I'll just
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:09.480]   sit in my little floating car and. I mean, it's, it's possible. I mean, they're, you know,
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:16.440]   reality to us is what we perceive at any moment in time. So it can be like, to you,
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.800]   you could say that, oh, people want to actually live real life with, with people like, well, they,
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:26.520]   at the end of the day, it's just neurons firing. I mean, if whatever triggers that,
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:32.040]   triggers that, that's a really interesting point. I mean, VR, as it stands now, you're immersed in
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.960]   the kind of semi realistic environment, but ultimately it could be your reality.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.480]   Then I couldn't have both. If you imagine, you know, there's a lot of,
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.960]   starts to talk about contact lenses that can project images on the, you can imagine a situation
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.800]   where you can have an augmented reality experience and then ultimately if you want to go full VR,
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.880]   that your vision could be completely included by some sort of virtual representation of,
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.800]   you know, your current landscape or a fictional landscape. So yeah, I would like to think that
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.240]   down the road, these two things will kind of blend together. You know, simply be stepping from one
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:09.480]   to the other somewhat seamlessly. But yeah, ultimately in the short term, at least in the mid-term AR,
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.240]   definitely the sort of thing that you can apply to your current data in life, whereas VR is going
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.640]   to be much more of a gaming entertainment sort of thing, as much as Facebook wants to turn into a
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.560]   social experience down the road and maybe they'll figure out a way to make, you know, a second life
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:27.000]   cool for a new generation. With their own merits and value and usefulness. For sure.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.920]   And I'm excited about the tips of the whole. What Tim said is really interesting too, because
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.120]   based on what we've heard so far, what limited things we've heard so far about magically,
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.920]   that's exactly what they're going for. That's Google's. That's Google's. Right. And that's Google too.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.280]   Or they have a heavy investment in them rather. But what they're doing is, you know, their technology,
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:51.240]   kind of, this is not the terminology they'd probably want us to use, but they kind of blast the images
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.600]   right into your eyeball and they can dial it up, you know, from AR, they dial it straight up to VR
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:02.360]   and back again as needed. And, you know, that's the kind of one gadget to roll them all. The ultimate
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:08.120]   goal is to not only, you know, have something cool, entertainment experience, but also just eliminate
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.200]   most of the screens in your life too. That's really what they're going for. And that's like a
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.360]   really bold mission for that company. But I mean, yeah, we're. Yeah, this is Magic Leap's.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.800]   Really kind of misleading video. That's augmented reality. And, you know,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:27.240]   I mean, these are kids in a gym and they're implying that what the kids are seeing, by the way,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:33.560]   the kids are not wearing anything is a giant whale leaping out of the gym floor. That's not
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:37.640]   though what the kids saw, obviously. And to shame the kids can't see because some of them are going
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.520]   to get crushed by that boy. It'd be nice if they could see it. Yeah. Do you think though? I mean,
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.000]   we'll have anything like that at some point. Mike, we really think they're on to something
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.880]   very similar to that. And the resolution is so. How would you do that with contact lenses?
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.120]   What would you? It's some kind of thing where, again, they haven't shown any of what they have.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.520]   But these people, John Durer, who spoke at our conference, I think there's two years ago,
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:05.640]   our BI admission conference. And he was just like, this thing's just blue, not my socks off.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:10.360]   It's amazing. How does this compare to HoloLens Microsoft's AR solution?
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:15.880]   It's totally different. So HoloLens, I was actually a little disappointed with how narrow
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:21.800]   the field of view is. If you look in your peripheral vision, the images that you're looking at kind
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:27.880]   of disappear. It's cool. You can walk around the room and walk around these fake objects in real life.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.080]   But it's nothing like those HoloLens videos show. We know a little more.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:40.440]   HoloLens evangelist Bruce Harris spoke at an event in Israel. And Brad Sams is reporting that he
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:47.560]   shared some more information about this five and a half hour use battery life, unless you're on
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.680]   heavy load and then it'll be two and a half hours. Anything can connect to the device as long as it
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:59.000]   supports Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. And here he addresses that tricky field of view image, whether you're
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.600]   looking through a slot, a mail slot or what he said, it's basically like a 15 inch monitor about
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:10.840]   two feet away from your face. And the reason, finally giving a reason for this and confirming it
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:16.680]   is because of cost and battery life. But Harris said as manufacturing improves the company intends
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:24.840]   to expand the field of view, it's just a price issue. He says it's being made by Microsoft,
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.760]   not by a third party, but not in the US. And of course we know that Microsoft has announced
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:37.080]   there'll be a developer edition for $3,000 coming out at some point this year.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.840]   So, you know, we're in early days of all of this stuff. I mean, it's interesting VR must be
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.080]   easier to do. I think it is technically a lot easier to do. You don't have to calculate
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:55.240]   in real time real world surfaces and respond to them. But that's a little bit of hand right now.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:01.320]   But I think both will be very important. And I'm kind of with you, Ben. I would probably wear
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:07.080]   an AR device of some kind, whether it's glass or hole lens or something else, a lot. I mean,
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.560]   I would love the idea of being in the real world, but getting augmented information about that
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:18.360]   real world. Yeah, I mean, generally speaking, a dedicated device is going to be a head and
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.520]   want to be dedicated, not just dedicated in that that's all the device does, but the device is
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:29.160]   dedicated to doing one sort of job. And like the gaming or console world and movie world has
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.760]   traditionally been ahead. And then things come along, you know, things like your phone come along,
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:42.440]   come along behind. But eventually they become good enough. And this is I think the one I've
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:48.920]   been actually relatively skeptical and critical of Facebook thinking that I could be a platform
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.160]   of the future. I think they certainly they want and expect it to be more than just the next console.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:03.560]   And one reason to. And so I think that's why Google and Microsoft have been more focused on the AR
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.320]   sort of things, which is I think is more about the platform of the future. And Google doesn't
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.000]   own magically. They've just invested in it via Google Ventures. But you know, if you want to have
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.520]   a defense of Facebook going the sort of aucuous route, it's that well, it is going to be the
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:25.880]   market first. I mean, you can buy one now or preorder one now. And and because yeah, it's it's a it's
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:32.360]   an easier problem to solve. And then can you branch out from that to more of an AR view? Maybe
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:37.720]   we'll see we'll see how it'll be certainly interesting to see how it plays out. There's a
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.240]   go to market challenge with any dedicated device, which Microsoft warned with, you know, they want
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.320]   the Xbox to be the computer for the home. The problem is like by starting with gaming, yes,
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.720]   there was an established market, but they ended up making it too expensive to be a computer for
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:58.520]   everyone. You know, I think there'll be there's always it's that's always the challenge building a
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:04.600]   platform from a dedicated device is you end up having a real tension between your hardcore
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:10.440]   customers and just casual people. For example, I didn't order an Oculus I'm going to get up.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.480]   I've unfortunately ordered to you want to you want to borrow one of mine?
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.200]   Sure, I would love to. You know, you have to buy a new computer to. Yeah, well, I would buy a new
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:23.240]   computer is more I more I kind of forgot about it. And then there was like already delays
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:29.640]   old June. I like well, yeah, I already have a ps4. Yeah, I'm in June as well. I had this little
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.920]   thing called CES going on. So I was a little late in ordering and I jumped on it and I got me.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.200]   But then I found out because I'm a kid I was a Kickstarter backer that I'm going to get another
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:46.920]   one a free one. I hope those come sooner. We should get those first, right? I think you will. Yeah,
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.400]   but it's not just going to be Oculus you got a lot of people are very excited about HTC's
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:57.800]   Vive, which is in a relationship with steam. Those are two good players. Sony's got their own helmet
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:07.240]   and now Google has really doubled down on AR or VR. They have taken a clay baver who was VP for
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:13.240]   product management. He was in charge of Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs. He also was in charge
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:21.240]   of cardboard. He's now dropping all the apps and he is going to be a senior vice president in charge
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:28.760]   of VR. They've got a guy doing VR full time at Google and a fairly, I think fairly high level
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:37.640]   guy. So that seems like his title is VP virtual reality or VP VR, which is what companies like
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:43.480]   Google do. They set up a thing and have a big press release announcement and everyone,
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:48.200]   because they're the big dog like, oh, they're going to take over to this. And then
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.440]   you know, that was my that was the story of Microsoft in the 90s and 2000s. And now it's
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.480]   Google today. And we'll see. Well, everybody wants to be in this space. That just tells you this is
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:03.000]   an important space, right? Oh, for sure. I mean, I think in the long run, I mean, I'm
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.200]   still more optimistic about about things like the watch than I think most people,
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.520]   but in the long run, if you think about what would replace a smartphone,
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:20.520]   you know, I think it's this is an obvious sort of area to end up in. You think of a smart watch is
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:29.080]   the next thing. I think I think there it will offload more and more functionality from a phone,
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.600]   from a phone. But obviously there's there's an input challenge. I did an interesting thing
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.080]   right before the show. We had a sixth grader who wanted to interview me and he was starting to
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:45.640]   write take notes on a smartphone that oh, this will take a while. So I said, wait a minute, I have
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.160]   a app I just put on my iPhone that attaches to the watch that has a complication on the watch,
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:57.160]   allows me to record. And I press the record button. It's what is it called press record.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.840]   That press record now. I can't remember. Let me look it up here.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:09.720]   It was just press record. It was it was awesome. The audio I could play you the audio the audio
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:17.400]   of from my watch. I'm sitting here with Addie. Sounds pretty good. I am sitting here with Addie
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:23.080]   who is going to now ask me some questions for Addie's. Doesn't that sound pretty much like
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:30.120]   I search paper in sixth grade. Question one. This is me and I'm not. Businesses are most
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.120]   affected by add. I'm not even really talking into my watch that much. I mean, it's kind of there.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.920]   You do need this because Steve, you could use this for interviews and stuff. I mean,
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.240]   holy, I'm downloading it right now. It's amazing. And then you need not all the watch
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:50.120]   faces support the complication. I'm using what is the name of this chronograph, but the
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.720]   complication on chronograph, you have a little microphone complication, you tap that, it records
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.800]   and then the cool thing is it immediately transfers it over to the phone. So as I was able to email
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:09.240]   this back to Addie, as soon as we were done, what's the app called? Just press record.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.680]   Where did I find out? I think I found out about this on Mac Break Weekly, one of our hosts,
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.560]   probably Renee Richie, or might have been. Yeah, they was Renee told me about this. Isn't that cool?
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:27.080]   So that is, this is the first app on the watch that I really thought, okay, that takes advantage
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.800]   of the watch as form factor in a unique way. I mean, I've got a stopwatch application on here,
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.600]   big deal. I mean, I could do that with a Timex. The basic thing for me is notifications. I mean,
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:43.960]   I just love not having to pull my phone on my pocket. That said, I will note that I like the
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:51.720]   watch I still wear it every day. It has reduced its utility in, for two reasons. One cold weather,
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:57.720]   because I have long sleeves on now. And so there's more effort involved in looking at it,
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:04.920]   which has been complicated by no pun intended, has been complicated by the fact that I broke
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:11.960]   my arm, which made it much. I didn't have another hand to pull my sleeve up. So it actually,
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.520]   for a few weeks anyway, it ended up being that pulling the phone on my pocket was more convenient
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.840]   than looking at my watch. You're not in the cast, are you okay? I just got the next stop.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   Oh, this was the fall you told us about. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:32.280]   Well, see, for instance, now I know that Ben Carson is doing a live Facebook feed of his town
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.840]   hall in South Carolina right now. And I wouldn't have known that if the watch hadn't told me.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.200]   Yeah, but this is why, I mean, what do I get to do with what involves?
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.400]   The way that involves you have to have control of your notifications,
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.880]   which I think Apple has not done a good enough job making it easy to manage.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:53.800]   You know, fortunately, I've trimmed down my notifications, but even before I had the watch.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.440]   But to get back to Google Glass, would that have that might be really a reasonable use for Google
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.600]   Glass? I mean, it could have done all those things we just talked about. Well, there's the social
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.920]   aspect, right? I mean, you got to have this thing on your face. I think that's the dark part.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.600]   Yeah. Well, that could get that it gets even gets back to the Uber stuff and all that sort of thing,
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:16.760]   technology technological change doesn't just depend on getting the technology right.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.120]   Like, especially the more that technology enters into the real world,
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.520]   in the case of cars, in the case of TV, or in the case of wearing something on your body.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:30.360]   Like there has to be real societal change in more ways in what's acceptable and what's not.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.600]   And wearing something on your face is certainly is certainly a part of that. I mean, but yeah,
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:41.480]   absolutely. You can see the idea of being able to just flick your eyes up and see something going
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.800]   on would be great. I mean, the one interesting thing about the watch, and I think Neale Patel nailed
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:52.360]   this right at the beginning in his mastery view, but it's certainly been the case is people are
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:58.200]   much more feel much more not offended, but they feel much more awkward about you looking at your
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.400]   watches, you know, vacation than even they do. You can be like, like, we've had so long.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:08.760]   It's an insult. But what's weird is you can come forward. I could be a coffee and I could be looking
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.920]   at my phone and you would just keep talking because we've had smartphones long enough that
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.200]   you know I'm not ignoring you. I'm just checking something. Whereas the watch hasn't been out long,
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:24.520]   like you would be more offended by by a point three second glance at my watch than you would.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.600]   And you actually pulling out this thing and putting it from my face. And it's so bizarre.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.160]   People will people will keep talking even as you pull the phone out, but they'll stop talking when
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.480]   you look at your wrist. Just because there's a social metaphor. Yeah, it's an old metaphor.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   We used to use watches till time and it also says boredom. You know, I think what was that famous
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.960]   debate was a George H.W. Bush or during the debate he was caught looking at his watch or something.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:52.440]   Right. So we have that old metaphor of this means I'm bored. You're bored. I need to get out of here
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:56.200]   and not, oh, I just got a text message from, you know, my best friend or something.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.960]   Of course, we saw Jeb Bush looking at his watch doing something rather. Oh, I got to show you that
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:08.760]   video, which was that cracked me up. I saw. Thank you for reminding me about that. Jeb Bush was
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:15.080]   talking to Des Moines Register because of course the Iowa caucus is coming up. And he must have just
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:23.800]   recently received an Apple watch because he apparently is a little confused about how it works.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.680]   Had one since the summer at least because I remember all his early campaign videos who
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   were going to do it. Really? So, hmm. In that case, there's less of an excuse for this behavior.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:49.240]   Let's go to the YouTube video. So it's hard to say here, but let me play it again. You can hear
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:57.880]   somebody say hello and Bush looks around going what? No. What? No, it's in the editorial board
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.320]   laughs. My watch can't be talking. Yeah, yeah, I could.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:11.400]   That look amazing. My watch is great. I'll call you back. I never had my
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:19.080]   bad phone be turned on. That's the coolest thing in the world. I think that besides being an awesome
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:24.600]   ad for Apple, I think it kind of humanized him a little bit. I like that. I absolutely agree. I
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.040]   think that's the most human side of Jeb Bush. I've seen the whole campaign process.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.640]   I mean, you could say as some as Crewell just said, Kevin Crewell in the chat room.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.880]   Jeb is dumb as a brick. You could come up with that conclusion, especially if you know he's
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:42.760]   owned this watch for months. Or it's just cute. He didn't really know.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:48.840]   I don't know. I don't know where I go. Fall down on that one.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.240]   To me, Jeb Bush looks like the potential savior from Donald Trump candidacy. So I'm kind of
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.560]   rooting for him a little bit. Let's take a break. We're going to come back. I'm sorry.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:03.000]   I put politics in here. I'd take it out. Take it out. Take it out. Edit that out, right?
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.120]   Right. They're going to edit that out. Done. Done. Whatever. techinsider.io. That's the new
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.360]   publication for Business Insider and Steve Kovac is one of our. What is your title?
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:20.680]   You're managing editor? Deputy editor. Deputy editor. Do you get a star, a badge of
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.480]   any question? I've asked and they still won't give me one. I keep bugging Henry and he still
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   wasn't giving me a deputy badge. I love that. It's great to have you, Steve. Always a pleasure
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:38.680]   joining us from New York from Brooklyn, probably. Yeah. No Manhattan. Oh, yeah. I moved on from
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:44.040]   Brooklyn. Oh, you have New York values, eh? Yeah, I do have New York values. Yeah. Was that a story
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.760]   in New York? I saw some of the daily news coverage. Oh, my God. No idea. Oh, that's all
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.200]   anyone could talk about for 24 hours. Oh, you mean like the fire department? FDNY? Oh, you mean
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:59.320]   that kind of values? Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was talking about. We also have from Taiwan,
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:04.120]   where they now have a for their first time ever, there will have a female prime minister.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.560]   You want to wait in the complicated politics? Oh, well, I do. When we come back, we could talk a
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:17.400]   little bit because she used social media quite effectively. I mean, I hear. Or is it? I would say
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:23.800]   it's used. I mean, the real social media, I think, story is actually in the US, what's happening there.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.240]   Well, we're going to take a break and you can answer that. You could. But we will talk about
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:35.000]   Sae Ingwen, the president, not prime minister. You have a president. Say it again?
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.320]   Sae Ingwen. Sae Ingwen.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:43.240]   Ingwen. Ingwen. There you go. That was better. Tones are still wrong.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:50.120]   What from that? Is it a one? It's actually the same character as English. So her name
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:56.520]   literally means English. Huh. Interesting. As in the language. I'm Ingwen. Tye Ingwen.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:03.400]   Science. Don't say the G. Ingwen. Ingwen. No, no, good.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.000]   All right. Thank you for the lessons. How's your Chinese? Is it good?
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:17.800]   The way I answer is it depends on who's talking. You better than mine. Not as good as Mark Zuckerberg's
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:23.240]   probably. No, it's much better than Mark Zuckerberg. His Chinese isn't that good. Is it bad?
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.520]   Well, he has he has he has an excellent vocabulary and his his actually his wisdom
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.640]   comprehension is very good. In some respects, it is actually is probably better than mine.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:37.960]   But his pronunciation is is pretty terrible. He doesn't really use tones at all. That's
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.880]   critical in Chinese because ma and ma are very different words. Right. I mean,
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:50.520]   yeah, you can directly change the meaning. I mean, he because his what it sounds like is it sounds
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:56.600]   like he's someone who's very busy and devoted a set of part of his day to like hardcore studying
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:02.120]   and which would make sense of being Mark Zuckerberg in not enough time with an actual Chinese speaker
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.680]   who is correcting his pronunciation and having a good foundation there. That said, I mean,
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.960]   still impressive as hell. We're not not super impressive denigrating the achievement.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.720]   I think his vocabulary is probably better than mine. And that's why he is understood and he's
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.880]   able to get across because he actually speaks. He has all the right words in the right places.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.640]   Yeah. Right. Exactly. And so but he sounds like a robot, probably.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:32.200]   Well, it just it just sounds weird. But but I mean, my tones aren't great. So I'm not I'm
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.280]   the pot calling the kettle black and given the fact that I actually live in a Chinese speaking
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.920]   company and presumably a more frequent than Mark Zuckerberg. I should be better than you are.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.120]   Right. Exactly. I this is this is this is pure spite.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:51.320]   It's great. Super impressive. I I I I I said, I said, at the time, are you in Taipei? Where are
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:58.440]   you for? Yeah, I'm in Taipei and joining us from Upper New York State. How's the ice racing,
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   Tim Stevens? A little too damp. Unfortunately, it's been a warm winter. People were water skiing.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.440]   I'm Christmas. No ice racing yet. Unfortunately, that's right. Christmas Eve. It was like 72
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.640]   degrees in downstate. It was like 70 degrees up here on Christmas Eve, which is not good for the
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.920]   ice production. I'm sorry to say and a truck actually just crashed through one of the local
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.400]   lakes. Oh, it's only get a little too eager trying to get out there on the lake. So not quite yet.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.680]   Dude, dude, I can't help. I can't resist noting for those of you watching video,
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.360]   Tim's highly impressive collection of badges, conference badges over your left shoulder there.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:39.000]   I have a collection, but boy, that thing is that thing looks like it weighs 50 pounds.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.240]   Yeah. And every now and again, I walk by and knock it off the wall and then I spend the
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.280]   hour and have putting it back up there again. They are they used to be in a nice order,
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.280]   but not anymore. I've got a bunch more since the CES in Detroit. I got to still hang up on
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:55.160]   the tubes. See, I'm trying to cut down on my conference attendance. So my badge ball is not
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:04.120]   growing as big as yours. Can't believe I just said badge ball. Hey, coming up and just
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:10.040]   a little bit. It was fun. We're going to add it out the awkward positive.
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:21.960]   We have a newsletter now. When did that start? Just now? This is the first week. All right,
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.040]   if you want to sign up for our Twitter newsletter, we'll put it out every Sunday for Monday
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.760]   consumption. It'll tell you what's ahead in the week for Twit. You can sign up at twit.tv/newsletter.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:39.480]   I have this is exciting, very exciting. And I will probably be required to contribute some to it
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:45.000]   and others, but it's mostly just an update on what's going on. Network highlights information
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.760]   about upcoming shows, reviews, picks, that kind of thing. We promise not to sell your email
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:58.520]   or in any way share it with anybody except us. But you will get a weekly email from us. And that's
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.840]   it. Just one weekly email. I'll tell you what's going on with Twit. And it's free.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:10.520]   Newsletters, as Reverend Dan says, are hot. Did you miss anything this week? We had a great week.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:15.480]   You know what? I think we've created a video montage. When the editors aren't cutting busy
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:20.840]   cutting stuff out of the show, they're doing things like this. Watch previously on Twit.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:27.720]   Wearing this king's hat because for a brief moment this weekend, I owned Twit.tv. What?
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:33.160]   This is an app called Stowen. Wait a minute. I heard you only all the port. Oh man.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:39.160]   Triangulation. We are talking about the best photography in the world with one of the best
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:43.960]   photographers in the world, Vincent LaFoure. Photography is ultimately about anticipation,
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.200]   knowing people, knowing their habits, and predicting what's going to happen several seconds in advance.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.040]   Those are what the best photographers do on a regular basis. They're incredible observers.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.600]   Know how. I have a problem. My parents keep running into the garage door wall.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.320]   I have seen people who put a tennis ball and attached to a string in a garage, but this
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.200]   sounds like you want to do it with the Arduino. So this is my dad entering the garage with his
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:13.160]   firefighter. Stay on target. Turned off your computer. No stop. Tech news today.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.600]   It is not easy for bosses to monitor how long their employees are sitting at their desk.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:22.200]   One thing that not many bosses have tried is secretly installing motion detectors.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.360]   Yes, this is the Davies' Heligraph, the staff there came back from the weekend break to find
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:34.360]   little gray motion and heat sensors. It didn't go down well, but it's free when you watch from work.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.840]   And yes, for those of you watching closely, our app pick of the week on Iowa today was secret,
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.120]   which promptly was shut down.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:49.320]   Huh? Stolen. That's secret. Stolen too. Secret also shut down. Stolen.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.360]   Well, actually we should we could talk a little bit about what happened with Stolen and why
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:30:00.600]   it was shut down. Coming up, we got a great triangulation for you tomorrow. It's a book I've
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.760]   been recommending in our Audible ads for some time called The Righteous Mind.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:10.120]   It's author Jonathan Haidt is a professor of moral philosophy. Where do our ethics come from?
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:15.080]   Are they inborn? Or are they taught to us? You might. The answer will surprise you.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:21.400]   It's very surprising. He also talks a little bit about why politics are so polarized in this
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:29.080]   country, why it's so difficult for like minds to come to an agreement on anything. It's a fascinating
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:35.480]   book and I can't wait to talk to Professor Jonathan Haidt. That's tomorrow on triangulation. Our
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:42.440]   show today brought to you by Squarespace, the place to make your next website, squarespace.com.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:47.080]   Whether you need a simple landing page, they're cover page thing. It's so cool. I use cover page
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:54.200]   for my leoville.com front page. It's a way to introduce yourself and who you are to people
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.600]   to show them links to your other social media. Because one of the things that's great about
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.640]   Squarespace is how it integrates in your Twitter, your Facebook, your Instagram, your YouTube and
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:11.880]   on. You're linked in and on and on. I just love it. It's so easy to modify it. Squarespace makes
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:20.280]   it really trivially easy to create a site, a blog, a portfolio. If you're a band, a site that includes
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:27.000]   tour dates and an easy to use calendar, you could sell. In fact, every template includes commerce.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   So you could sell your CDs or do donations. It'd be great for a charity.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:38.280]   It's all built in, including mobile responsive templates that make it very easy for you to make
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:44.680]   a site that looks beautiful on any size screen. I am just such a huge fan of Squarespace.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:54.920]   For affordable, easy to use and stay to the art, web hosting that never, ever, ever goes down.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.920]   I mean, I don't know if they never go down, but I've never had them go down. In fact,
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:04.680]   even if you get a lot of traffic, it's so robust. You'll get a free custom domain name with an
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:11.320]   annual purchase. It's a great way to promote your business, to create and manage your store.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:16.040]   By the way, your store, and this is not your typical shopping cart experience, it's not going
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:22.200]   to look like some dumb shopping cart. It looks like your site. It matches. It matches your ethos.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.760]   Are you a musician? Do you have a band? Do you have a business? Are you getting married?
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:32.760]   Don't go to one of those crazy marriage template sites. It's so much better on Squarespace.com.

[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:57.160]   We're talking tech with the big brains in the business. Tim Stevens from C.E.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:04.920]   A CNET, his new show, by the way, is at theroadshow.com. It looks slick from the Detroit Auto Show.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.240]   Your first show really looks great. Thank you very much. They're doing a nice job there.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:14.920]   I'm thrilled for you because I know you're really into this subject. It's nice to combine your passion
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:19.000]   with your job. It absolutely is. I really appreciate the kind of words.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.680]   Yeah. I feel like that's what you've done to Ben Thompson. It's clear you have a passion for
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:28.760]   the subject and you write so well at Stratecary. I immediately paid for a subscription because,
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.640]   frankly, the insight you offer is just second and none. Stratecary.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:38.200]   I always clarify, if you go to Stratecary, there are free articles that you pay for is
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:44.360]   to get three extra ones a week, basically. Really worth it.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.800]   Really great stuff. And then the exponent podcast. Is that going well for you?
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.320]   It is. It's going very well. Exponent.fm. So we're up into the 60s now.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:02.280]   And yeah, it's quite popular. I think it's me and James Alworth, who's actually a co-author with
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:07.720]   Clay Christensen of How Will You Measure His Life and is your great background.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.840]   I love Clay Christensen.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:09.000]   I love Clay Christensen.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   So that's great. I'm not familiar with James. I have to start listening.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.600]   Yeah, we approach things. We do get into some of the analysis stuff and certainly there's a
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:25.720]   connection to Stratecary and what I write about. But I think we're particularly interested in kind
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:32.840]   of the social impact of things. I think this will be Roblox cars, but I think last week we
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.560]   talked about inequality. Yeah, you used the Paul Graham essay as a starting point, which is
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.640]   a good place to start.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:46.360]   Yeah, it would absolutely. It was certainly did a great job in sparking conversation.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.840]   The conversation, which is great. I think it was unfortunate in some of the
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:58.600]   words were spoken, but they weren't conversational aspect, which doesn't do anybody good.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.040]   But yeah, that's definitely a check it out. Is it really listening to a podcast? That's actually
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.960]   probably the product I should push more than the site?
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.520]   No, I'm not sure I agree. I think it's both.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.240]   It's both. Some people like to read. Some people like to listen.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.240]   I like to watch.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.840]   And I can watch the video.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:23.800]   What do we, I have to like make my bed and I have to like.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.880]   I know. What is this? What is this? I know.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.160]   You have, do you actually have a stuffed animal or is that an actual cat?
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:36.680]   Oh, that's that's my son. See, it's a Santa Olaf stuffed animal.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.240]   Perfect.
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.840]   Yeah, I know. Because your son is culturally confused enough.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   Yeah, I wanted to humanize myself.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:53.080]   Also with this, my good buddy, Stephen Kovac from tech insider.io. He's at Tech Insider.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.560]   Or no, you're not at Tech Insider.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.160]   Well, yeah, technically. Are you? I guess. Yeah.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.120]   And that's Steve Kovac. Steve Kovac. Yeah. Nice.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.920]   You can see me both, but that's Steve Kovac. It's the best way to follow me.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.400]   Yes. What is the best pizza place in New York?
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.800]   You know what? I have not read that story yet.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:13.480]   It doesn't go to hell. I could tell you right now, it ain't that pizza because it's square.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.440]   You want to get into controversial topics.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.280]   Jeez. That is not there.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.240]   Pizza's round, not square. It's not New York value.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:24.840]   And it ain't that pizza. Ritzo's fine pizza? No, I think not.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:29.400]   I've never even heard of that. Yes. No, nobody eats there. It's too crowded.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.920]   Anyway, great to have all three of you. And let's just real quickly,
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.520]   congratulate. I can't pronounce her name apparently.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:45.320]   Sai for becoming the first female president. So what's the story there?
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.320]   Is there a tech story, tech angle to that Ben?
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:50.280]   Sai, it's Sai, England. No, I think
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.440]   she's the pro-independence party though, right?
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:02.280]   Well, I think that both parties are at least in their public positions,
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:09.480]   much more like Orange or Status Quilt. No one wants to...
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:13.240]   There's always stories about instigating China,
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:16.520]   wherever no one wants to instigate China, China does what China wants to do,
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.680]   which is kind of forgetting these stories. They have free will.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:24.280]   It's like having a £1,000 gorilla over your shoulder breathing that day.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.480]   It certainly impacts the politics in all ways. I think that probably the more
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.080]   interesting tech angle in Taiwan generally was there was actually an excellent story in the New
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:40.520]   York Times on Friday talking about the struggles of Taiwan's tech industry.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:48.440]   The old guard is still really holding on as far as just from an executive position.
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:54.120]   And Taiwan was tied so closely to the PC in particular and has had a
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:58.920]   very difficult challenge in adapting to the New World Order.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:09.320]   In so much as there is an angle, it is the concern that in general tech won't be the driver
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:16.120]   that has been for a long time. And also that Taiwan needs to move beyond a manufacturing
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:23.720]   mindset and approach. And it's a generational thing again. I think the big thing that
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:30.200]   drove this election was discontent about things like wages relative to real estate, for example.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:37.720]   And there's definitely a youth, much more of a component to this and a lot of disillusionment
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.120]   with the current government. I mean, I'm not going to wait in on the other side because
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:49.400]   my job is about technology, not politics. But it was definitely a sea change.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   The last two actions have been a real sea change. Just the party in power basically almost wiped
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:00.360]   out. And so it'll be very interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.640]   There is a tech angle because that's a cat lover.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:11.640]   Yes, absolutely. She is. So there you go. I mean, that's what more could you ask her?
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:18.520]   There also is a hashtag, #Synami. Yeah, there's actually, I mean, if you want to get like the
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:24.600]   tech angle, here's a picture that I took at the 7 web the other day and the 7 web is here.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:30.040]   Are amazing. But here it's a roller coaster. This is like a tabloid type magazine. It's hard to
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:37.800]   see probably. It's a roller coaster with Apple on the front and then all like a bunch of famous
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.920]   Taiwan component suppliers on the back and saying, you know, look out below certain sort of thing.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.520]   You know, concern about, you know, if as as Apple and the iPhone goes, so goes a lot of Taiwanese
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:57.240]   companies. But in general, that's that's for better or worse, that's still the tech angle that
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.560]   matters is is is component is components and the supply chain. And you know, the hopes for
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:09.560]   Taiwanese branded tech companies like Acer and Asus and HTC obviously did not turn out. And
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:17.800]   there isn't a great software industry. Right. That sort of part to compete with a manufacturing
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:23.400]   the manufacturing China of China. I mean, that really is tough. I mean, there are still
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:28.600]   successful. I mean, but it's just Japan and Korea both starting to feel this pressure, right?
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:34.920]   Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think anything that that is, you have to compete by being very highly,
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:41.640]   you know, differentiated and the labor focused manufacturing and there's different,
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.520]   there's very different parts of supply chain. I mean, everyone knows that phones are made in
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:50.760]   China, but actually the value add of China is like sixth or something. And I so we feel like
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.880]   an iPhone, because the final it's it's actually to assemble in China, but really the software is
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:00.600]   American. Well, if you go through and you and you and you calculate the value of the parts that go
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:06.600]   into an iPhone, actually the United States is actually first. I believe South Korea or
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.760]   South Korea, Japan, Taiwan. Because Samsung makes the chips. Right.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:16.360]   Sam's in the memory also. And there's different parts, but then like, for example, like the camera,
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.840]   like the sensors made in Japan, the actual lens modules made in Taiwan.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:26.360]   Lots of Taiwan, I think by volume might have the highest number of suppliers of the iPhone
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:33.880]   or it's somewhere up there. And so the made in China, like there's lots of parts that go into
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.720]   making a phone. It's assembled in China would actually be a more appropriate term.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:45.640]   Well, the TSM see the big Taiwan, these manufacturing company with second source now for the chips,
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.080]   the CPUs and iPhones, right? Well, they've been the sole source at times. It's kind of got back and
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:58.680]   forth. I think it's right now it's split. I believe that people suspect that Samsung's going to get
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.600]   back next year. Samsung just got a stalk on me 20 contract, which is a big deal.
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:07.960]   But yeah, the TSM see is the largest chip manufacturer in the world.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.000]   Wow. Hey, if you have a Nest thermostat, you might have been left in the cold literally
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.400]   this week. That's what Nick Bilton said in his New York Times article.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.440]   The Nest thermostat, which is of course owned by Google as the entire Nest company is
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:28.600]   at a mysterious software bug. Apparently there was a firmware update pushed a couple of weeks ago
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:34.600]   that drained its battery and sent Nick's home into a chill in the middle of the night. But Nick
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:40.760]   wasn't alone. Many, many Nest owners were now Nick has a newborn. He says he was woken by the
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:48.280]   baby crying at 4 a.m. The nest was off his room was 64 degrees and dropping. Apparently this was
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:54.520]   quite a bug and not so much if you live in Los Angeles as Nick does, but very much so if you
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.560]   used a nest in your vacation home in the Rockies, for instance, and your pipes are frozen.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:07.080]   There is a fix, but you have to take your nest off the wall, plug it into a computer via USB,
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:14.120]   push a bunch of buttons. It's a nine step process to reset it. It takes at least an hour.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:20.440]   And meanwhile, you're freezing. Oh, this is not a good thing. Nick says a number of his friends
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:26.040]   did the easy thing, which is go out to the hardware store and buy a $25 not so smart thermostat that
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:32.520]   actually worked. That kind of a black mark for next nest, but even maybe more importantly,
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:39.800]   a black mark for the Internet of things. And that's one of those things that you want to always
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:43.560]   work, especially if you're away on vacation and that kind of thing happened. You know, if you were
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.080]   away for two weeks and it was below freezing, absolutely your pipes would be burst and you could
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.840]   be in a lot of trouble. These are the things that absolutely have to work all the time. Just like
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.880]   the nest protects, that was another big bug. You waved at it to turn off the sound, but it turned
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:05.800]   out it also turned off the smoke alarm. Yeah, permanently. Not such a good thing if you have a fire.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:11.720]   In fact, we were talking about this with Jason Kalkanis again last yesterday on the new screen
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:15.720]   say, "So the opinion of the nest is struggling a little bit." He thinks that there are some
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:21.880]   defections from nest. People don't like working for Tony Fadel and that some of the nest technology
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:28.440]   is not doing so well. Maybe this and by separate, and he made this point which I thought was interesting,
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:35.080]   by separating nest out from Google, making it a separate division under alphabet. Yes,
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:39.800]   there's more autonomy. Yes, the company can be run more independently, but it also means you can't
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:46.600]   hide failure. And it actually could, if an company's struggling like this, could hasten its demise.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:56.680]   Yeah, this is a pretty brutal failure, I think, by nest. I think they've, it seems like they've
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:03.080]   skated by relatively unscathed. I mean, fortunately, I thought there'd be a couple, you know, like
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:08.760]   pipes bursting stories to Tim's point. I mean, they're getting the tens of thousands of dollars
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:15.480]   potential worth of damage. But I mean, the big challenge with selling something that's way more
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.680]   expensive than the standard is it's all about the delta between what you already have and what
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.560]   and what you're going to go out to get. Yeah, it's already four times more expensive.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:32.520]   Right. And so this is offered all these upsides. But if you have this big potential downside in
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:37.240]   buyer's minds, like now that that compresses the delta just as much as any feature can expand it.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:47.400]   And Nick points out, by the way, that the in deep buried within the nest agreement is a
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:53.720]   requirement that you use arbitration. And so that if you did suffer some damage,
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:59.240]   there are limits to the damage, as you can specify. And you'd have to go to San Francisco for the
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.600]   arbitration advantage of software. And and you have to keep it confidential.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.040]   Blah, blah, blah. We're seeing a lot more of that, right? Those arbitration clauses.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.520]   Everyone reads them before they agree. Yeah, right. Oh, yeah.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.080]   Whatever. No, it's interesting. This is this is an advantage of software for the companies is
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.360]   that you have to like, there is a capacity to quick a you. I mean, like, if you if you
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:31.400]   can't quick a you in your Honeywell thermostat that you get for 25 bucks at the at the software store.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:36.520]   And so I think the validity of you is I think a little still a little bit of an open question.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.000]   Yes.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.160]   But generally it's been supported that because people are actively clicking except
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:47.800]   whereas something like, oh, it was in the box and you implicitly accepted it is is
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:53.960]   much more difficult. And maybe nest took advantage.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:59.240]   This is not the only Internet of Things failure in the news this week.
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:02.360]   One of our sponsors, Ring, that makes the Ring video doorbells,
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:10.120]   had a problem as well. There was a post from a security blogger who had figured out that if
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:15.000]   you take the Ring video doorbell, which is a doorbell that is tied to your Wi-Fi as a camera,
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:21.080]   microphone and speaker, if you take it off, plug it into your computer. You can fairly easily
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:31.880]   extract the users Wi-Fi login and password. And I I tweeted gee, I'd much more worried about
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:37.000]   losing my $200 doorbell than that. But the point is you could put it then back on. You do this in
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.960]   the dead of night, put it back on. Hope that nobody noticed when they when you remove the Ring and
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:47.320]   then you'd have the password and you could continue on with it. Ring, however, had a better ending to
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.120]   this story because it turns out that the Ring video doorbells are why are updateable automatically.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:57.960]   They are on the Wi-Fi and Ring was alerted of the security flaw, developed a solution and
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:04.520]   pushed it out to all active Ring devices two weeks ago so that at this point, no Ring video
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.800]   doorbell is vulnerable. But it's points out the we're going to say this is just the beginning
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.680]   of a lot of stories because all of these internet things of devices, whether it's your Samsung
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.880]   refrigerator with a camera in it or your doorbell or your car or your thermostat or your car,
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:25.400]   they're all tied to your Wi-Fi. And if they security practices on these products aren't good,
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.880]   they could lower the total security of your network. I saw a great tweet today. I can't find it
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:35.240]   right now, but I think it was something like in 1999, 1995, our houses were full of digital
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:41.320]   devices blinking 12 o'clock in 2025. Our house would be full of digital devices with the password
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:47.880]   admin. Well, you know, one thing that Ring did right, which is they put in a mechanism for
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.240]   automatically updating the firmware instantly. And that got them off the hook for this one.
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.920]   So they did do that right. And I think that that points the way for future. A lot of these
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.960]   devices are not updateable or don't have a mechanism to do that. And that's a problem.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.800]   That's going to be a problem. I wonder if the nest can be updated over the year. In fact,
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.040]   was updated over the year. I think that was the problem is that they had pushed a firmware update,
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.760]   which then two weeks later caused this nest problem. And once it's dead, you can't update it.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:20.360]   Too late. Let's see.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:30.360]   Facebook mentions for Android big deal. I did though have to do a live stream immediately,
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:37.320]   just to see if it worked. Facebook Messenger apparently an app for Mac on its way, according to
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:43.880]   photo evidence that crunch got from somebody. A US widow is suing Twitter,
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:51.560]   saying that Twitter gave voice to Isis. Her husband was killed in Jordan.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:59.240]   And she says Tamara Fields. She says that when her husband Lloyd died in a November 9th attack
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:04.760]   on the police training center in Amman, Twitter knowingly let the militant Islamic group use its
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:10.760]   network to spread propaganda, raise money and attract recruits. This is a tough case.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.840]   Oh, it's not. It's not a tough case. Why not? Because
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:25.640]   one, she wants triple damages. Twitter violated. She says the federal anti-terrorism act. Hard to
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:32.440]   prove. Yeah, the newest to say, I think it fails from, I'm not a legal scholar, but I would hope
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.760]   it fails from a legal standpoint, not in the obvious common sense standpoint. That said, I mean,
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:42.360]   it's certainly you can make the case that Twitter's definitely significantly increased
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:48.200]   regulation of what is allowed and isn't has opened them up to this more than they might have
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:54.120]   been in the past when basically anything was allowed. But certainly.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:59.000]   And they need to have knowledge or willful blindness for it to
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:08.600]   satisfy the legal standard. In this article, though, from Reuters, they do mention that a couple of
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:13.800]   years ago, a lawyer convinced a Brooklyn, New York jury to hold Jordan's Arab bank liable for
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:23.080]   handling transactions for a Palestinian militant group Hamas. And while that bank settled in August,
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:28.840]   maybe provides a precedent. There's a tough one for Twitter, just in general.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:38.920]   I don't know what you do. Are you responsible for every bit of stuff that's on Twitter?
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:45.560]   Not even close. Again, it's the willful thing. And they've been shutting down accounts left and
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:51.000]   right from ISIS as soon as they get a little bit. But you can't permanently shut down a person,
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.680]   because they just create a new account. It's too easy.
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:01.480]   And then what are you going to do to the entire internet, you know, press or whatever.
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.480]   There's no case here.
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:14.360]   Well, I think it is a challenge for Twitter. There was the controversy. A couple weeks ago about
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:22.280]   the gamergate guy getting his his verify check removed at Nero, de verified,
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:27.080]   de verified. Yeah, which is interesting. I think that actually that I mean, whatever the complete
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:33.320]   opposite. Rather rather not wait. I really read not wait into it. But no, because we're just
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:38.040]   publicized in the guy and his feed. Well, I think in general, it's the exact opposite direction
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:43.320]   Twitter needs to be going. Yeah, there are there are absolutely an I knowledge strong arguments
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:51.480]   for allowing anonymity. On the flip side, there are very real problems with anonymity. And I think
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:53:00.360]   that Twitter should in generally be moving towards towards more verified accounts. And
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:08.760]   and less and having less room for this sort of drive by sort of abuse that is that is unfortunately
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:15.240]   much more suited to Twitter than almost any other network. I mean, the beauty of Twitter is I can
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:20.840]   reach out to and have a conversation with anyone on the planet that may or may not reply. One of
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:25.240]   the problems is that anyone on the planet can reach out and have a conversation with me. And
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:29.400]   sometimes that's not particularly pleasant. Now, for me, I don't really have a problem because I'm
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:34.600]   fortunate to one have great Twitter followers. Thanks guys. I love you. And also to be a,
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:40.680]   I mean, to be Franco white male who just doesn't have to deal with that. There are others that
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:48.360]   aren't as fortunate. And I mean, not as fortunate as Twitter mentions, they're perfectly fortunate
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:56.280]   as human beings that have to deal with a significant level of abuse. And and the problem for Twitter
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:03.000]   is at what point is that worth it? What point is it worth it to have drive by callouts that you
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.840]   didn't ask for? And that's a, that's a, what's the word? It starts with an E.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:15.800]   That's an existential problem for Twitter. Like people just not wanting to be there,
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:22.680]   not being on the platform. And I think there's the whole like free speech sort of thing. Like,
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:30.840]   there's there's different aspects of free speech in that one Twitter is not a government and the
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:35.000]   free speech is a guarantee that the government's not going to be speech, not corporation, but two,
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:46.200]   allowing, allowing abuse and which by extension drives people away and makes people not want to
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:51.880]   promote conversation, you are in aggregate limiting speech, arguably even more than just
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:57.640]   registering against hate speech specifically as hard as that is to regulate. And I think this
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:05.240]   aspect of, of private corporation allowed speech, it gets looked at that such a black and white
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:12.920]   issue that is free speech or it's not when free speech versus controlling abuse are not necessarily
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.880]   in opposition because there's a very real cost to speech that comes from unfettered abuse.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:23.960]   And and it's more of an opportunity type cost, the sort of people and conversations that disappear.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.800]   And no one there's not an easy way to track or measure them. And I think that's a lot of people
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:35.720]   tend to undervalue that. Let's take a break. I want to do some final thoughts in just a second.
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:41.640]   I do want to mention in this world of stress and strain, there is a place you can go for a
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:49.160]   healthier, less stressed life into your head with head space. I am I'm a big fan of meditating,
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:54.440]   have been using head space since July, just a few minutes a day and everything just gets a little
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:00.680]   bit better. I love every time I hear Andy Putty, but he comes cute British accent. I just,
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:06.680]   it kind of my heart rate slows, my blood pressure goes down. I'm become a huge fan. Maybe you saw
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.240]   Andy's TED talk, five and a half million views. He leads all the meditations in head space.
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:19.320]   He was a Buddhist monk for 10 years. This is really good stuff based on thousands of years of
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:25.640]   tradition, but also many, many modern scientific studies that show the positive effects
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:33.400]   like improving focus, relationship harmony, decreasing anxiety and stress. I love head space.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.160]   I was so happy when I discovered it. And I want to invite you to try it for free.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:44.920]   All you have to do is go to headspace.com/twit. They have a thing they call their Take 10 program
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:49.720]   because if you do this just for 10 days and just I just invite you to try this
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.280]   10 minutes a day for 10 days. It's not even 10 minutes initially. It's very, it's very brief.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.960]   You will really see its benefits and you can then decide if this is something for you.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:07.080]   Do me this favor. I think it is awesome. Headspace.com/twit.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:11.960]   10 free meditation sessions. I almost don't want to even use the word meditation. We need to
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:18.680]   come up with another word. The magic mindfulness session or something, but it really does the job.
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.680]   Headspace.com/twit. You'll sleep better. You'll feel better. You'll be more relaxed.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:28.440]   And because it's on your computer or your phone or your tablet, you really can use it anywhere
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:33.400]   in the train anywhere. Hey, here's some really good, by the way, thank you Headspace for your
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:38.360]   support of this week in tech. Thanks to all of our sponsors. Thanks to all of our hosts today
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.720]   to our contributors. Really, you make a huge difference on the show. I'm going to end on a happy note.
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:48.680]   After you tricked me to talk about both Taiwanese politics.
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:57.160]   Man, you brought me down. But the good news is the puppy bowl this year will be in VR, ladies and
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:02.040]   gentlemen. Yes. Yes. My Oculus doesn't come until June. This is the terrible word.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:06.760]   Can you wear cardboard for it? I hope so. It's got to have to be hard. Yeah, it will be
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:11.480]   on YouTube, Animal and Plants website. You can see it in Samsung's milk app. If you have the
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:17.080]   gear VR, you'll be able to use the milk app. Good. Strap on your cardboard, folks.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:24.680]   And be able to, I actually am a big fan now of 3D video. And thanks to the fact that YouTube
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:31.160]   and Facebook support it. And you can just do this with your mouse, you know, and mouse around.
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:37.720]   It's fun on Facebook when they do those videos. Did you see my videos for my vacation? I did 3D
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:43.640]   videos of my cruise ship. Cool. This actually is much higher quality. I was using the Theta,
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:51.960]   which is the Ricoh Theta S, which is inexpensive, 350 bucks, very easy to use. But this really
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:55.960]   looks high quality. They're probably using something even better. Nikon announced a really
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:59:02.520]   interesting high quality 3D camera at CES. I don't know if any of you guys got to see it,
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.320]   but I'm kind of excited about this. I want to do Twit this way.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.960]   One piece exciting is the puppy ball. It definitely seems like the next generation of
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:14.440]   action cameras will be generating this 360 footage, which would be an interesting thing.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:19.800]   You know, when HDTVs came along and now 4K, there was a real glut of content. And that's
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:23.960]   been one of the things that people are skeptical about VR because it's such a small amount of
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:28.600]   content available. But if these 360 action cameras become popular, maybe that'll be,
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:31.800]   you know, how a lot of people are consuming this content. Maybe that'll fill that gap until we
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:34.600]   have more cinematic quality content, that kind of thing.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:38.840]   I think the 360 stuff is more interesting than the 3D stuff.
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.040]   Oh, much more. Yeah.
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:46.760]   One thing that people, like TV manufacturers, I think, always pushing for 3D and pushing for 4K
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:52.360]   and sort of thing failed to appreciate is that a big reason why people bought HDTVs was not for HD.
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:58.280]   It's because the TV set itself was physically such a better object to have this thin thing,
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:08.200]   it's at this big massive box. And I think that with VR, the immersive aspect is such a,
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:13.560]   like, that's just as important as the content itself, like that. It is a physically different
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:20.280]   sort of experience and as opposed to the 3D or even 4K sort of thing.
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:26.680]   I love this. This is a video from my vacation with the Theta S. I'm on the back of the boat.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:30.840]   And what you can do is, yeah, it's like a vlog where you see me talking, but you can look around,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:35.320]   you can look at what I'm looking at, you can look at what's going on, you can look at the sky,
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:39.080]   you can look at the ocean, you can look at what's going on behind me.
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:45.320]   And this was a cheap $350 camera. I take it with me everywhere now because I feel like
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:49.400]   this is a really interesting way. If you're, you know, I mean, if you're just talking on,
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:53.560]   like we are, I don't know if there's much value to it. But if you're in somewhere interesting,
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:57.480]   the ability to look around is kind of neat.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.160]   Right. Especially once you can do that is by moving your head instead of having that.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.240]   Well, you can. If you had cardboard, I mean, obviously, you know, but you have
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.360]   cardboard. No, I mean, why not? Or you're doing it on your phone. You can even as you,
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:13.800]   you can move around with your phone and with YouTube and Facebook, it senses your accelerometers.
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:18.600]   And it actually does move around with you, which is kind of neat. I feel like this is,
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.280]   this is a surprise technology that came out of nowhere. Do you think this is why
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:30.520]   heroes struggling a little bit? Go pro didn't go pro. I think going through some.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.640]   Big trouble. Yeah. What's what's that all about? The stock is tumbling.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:41.720]   It's all about the history of every single non software differentiated hardware company ever.
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:49.160]   I mean, they sell, they sell like the story is that the, it's all about the community. The
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.280]   reality is, is there is no pure hardware company that doesn't have differentiated software that
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:57.880]   has been able to maintain sustainable profits. That's a really good insight.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.720]   It's just too easy to copy them. The CS four was littered with just dozens and dozens and dozens
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:09.160]   of GoPro clones. And they looked the same and you know, these, you know, Shenzhen based
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:14.520]   companies just pump them out. Same. It's the same gadget. But it's always been that way.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.280]   And GoPro has always been able to elevate them above the herd by having this brand image,
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:22.680]   you know, these kind of silly looking silver cameras stuck on the helmets of all the pro
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:26.920]   boat across for racers and everything else that you want to be. But definitely, you know,
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:30.600]   those things are becoming more and more commoditized. It's going to become more difficult for them.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.400]   They've got to stay progressive. They've got to stay ahead of the curve. And right now,
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:38.120]   they don't have an affordable 360 VR option. They do have that high in Google thing that we saw
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:42.840]   in Iowa last year, but that's, you know, $10,000 or something like that. They need a 360 camera and
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.200]   they need a drone in the market really soon. And certainly there's all the talk that those
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:50.040]   things are coming, but they're not here yet. When you love them, there's two things. I mean,
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:56.360]   one, yeah, those points are both well made, but two, a brand ultimately has to be based on something
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:01.800]   like and and and GoPro not being different is a problem for the brand the long run.
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:06.840]   And then three, the reality is the brand that matters as far as community and content when it
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:11.960]   comes to the sort of sports that GoPro's folks on is Red Bull. I mean, Red Bull has,
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:19.960]   has occupied the position that I think GoPro was striving for. And so they're a nice secondary brand.
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:25.000]   But that's a secondary brand based on increasingly
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:33.960]   disappearing brand value and brands. That's why brands fade. The reason why the Apple brand,
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:39.640]   for example, Apple doesn't succeed because Apple absolutely does succeed because the Apple brand.
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:44.760]   But that brand in the long run, if Apple stopped innovating, if Apple stopped having interesting
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:50.040]   new features and new products, the value of that brand would fade as all as brands do.
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:55.320]   And how does Apple stay differentiated by having software differentiation? Like that's how they
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:01.080]   differentiate their products is the key is iOS and that sort of thing. And GoPro by lacking that,
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:10.200]   again, this is just what happens. This is all unexpected. Again, the challenge as far as
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:13.800]   picking stocks off goes is timing. Although this is probably one that would have been easier to
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:20.440]   get right than others. I don't know what Nikon's 360 degree action camera will cost or when it
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:25.880]   will be available. But having had such a great experience with the RICO and knowing how much more
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:30.840]   could happen with higher quality images and better audio and so forth, I'm very excited about this
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:35.960]   category. This is kind of a out of nowhere category that does transform the action can because
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.560]   well, wouldn't you Tim, when you're doing your ice racing and your truck love to have a 360
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:43.880]   degree view? You could talk and people could watch you, but I think you could also look out the window.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:48.520]   Yeah, I'm also excited about track this stuff on my motorcycle in the summertime. I usually have
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:52.520]   a camera mounted on the tail of the bike, but it's difficult to position cameras because you
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:56.440]   don't know if you want to see forward or backward. And I could just have one and see a redirection.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.640]   Yeah, you don't have to worry about it. In fact, it took me a while when I'm shooting these to
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:03.560]   remember, it doesn't matter. I don't have to point it myself. I don't have to point at anything. I
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:08.520]   just hold it and it's getting it all. I took it. I would start aiming the camera and realize,
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:14.280]   Oh, what am I doing? I'm just confusing people by moving around. Hey, Tim, does that does that
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:19.080]   there is that video? And I think the market's in that drone that like follows you. Yeah.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:22.200]   Does that does that actually work? Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:26.200]   Yeah, it's that. Yeah, one of those just imploded. Is that the is that the company?
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:31.000]   I think it was Lily. Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Anthony,
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.280]   tell us one. Intel has a really impressive one they showed at CS. It's like $1,200 and it has
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:41.640]   that real sense camera that can dodge obstacles and all kinds of stuff is really impressive.
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.080]   Yeah, I will. I mean, you have to make it to market though, right?
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:51.880]   Yeah, the crowd funding one did is not going to happen, I believe, which is a shame.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.400]   Was that Nixi? Which one was that one? Nixi is Lily. Lily.
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:59.640]   Lily. Nixi is the one you wear. It's a wristwatch that's a drone and you take it off and it flies
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:05.880]   around. That was so weird and it just didn't feel like that was going to go anywhere. I don't know.
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:13.080]   God. Oh my God. I think that went on to HP or Intel's award award.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:18.120]   They're not out of business anyway. I mean, they're still around. Yeah, there it is an Intel.
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:25.880]   They had a demo at their CES keynote. So it's not just a CG animation.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:32.040]   Apparently not. Well, you wouldn't want to wear that prototype, but I mentioned before that the
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:36.040]   mistake technologies make is thinking too much about the technology and not enough about the
[02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:42.760]   go-to-market angle. Well, the only thing easier than thinking about technology relative going to
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:53.000]   market is building concepts versus actual building. There's drawing board easy. There's concepts
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:59.480]   harder, but still easier. There's prototypes. There's actual producing something at scale,
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:07.640]   which is the huge leap. And then there's actually finding a market, which is actually even
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:14.120]   a distribution. And the focus, what people think about and the focus of the press in general and
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:18.840]   stuff tends to be completely backwards relative to what matters in those. All you have to do is
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:31.480]   look at my sad graveyard of supported Kickstarter projects to realize it's very hard to get these
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:38.200]   things to market. But that's going to pay off pretty soon. Yeah, I can't believe I get a free one.
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:44.520]   It's a portfolio. Yeah, portfolio. There you go. I am supposed to get my Robin's smartphone soon.
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:53.000]   I don't know if I'll ever get the... I bought a modular smartphone case, which I still haven't
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.880]   gotten. But the problem is by the time I get it, the smartphone is designed for is... I'm not
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:04.600]   going to be using that. So, freaky. You just can't win. Nine dollar computer might get that.
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:11.640]   Smartphone. Supposedly I get that next month. I hope I get a mechanical pencil someday.
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:17.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much for joining us. Thank you, Tim Stevens. Good luck. I hope
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:23.800]   the lake freezes soon. Thanks very much. I hope so too. It'll be hard to ice reach without the ice.
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:29.880]   It's great to have you. And congratulations once again on the roadshow.com. If you're into cars
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:33.640]   and what's happening with cars, you couldn't have picked a better time to do it or a better person
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:39.400]   to do it. Tim Stevens, congratulations. Thank you, Leo. Yep. Thanks also to Steve Kovac,
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:48.200]   techinsider.io is the new site. Not that new. Six months old, I feel like it's new in tech terms.
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:55.160]   Yeah. Yeah. Great stuff, including the best pizza in New York, and how gravitational waves could
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:00.600]   change physics forever right next to each other. Where... What other sites gonna give you that?
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:06.600]   It's a good mix. It's a great mix. Yeah. How could you not want to scroll through that forever?
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:12.200]   I'm gonna book... I'm gonna make you my home page. There you go. Perfect. I don't want to miss a single,
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:16.600]   by the way. Okay, just real quickly making a murder. Did he do it or not?
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:22.200]   I'm... No spoiler. I'm not clicking on that. Oh, don't click on that. Don't click on that. Oh!
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.680]   The hottest... I'm gonna go straight through that. The hottest Netflix show ever.
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:35.240]   Well, I have some strong opinions. We'll talk. And you don't have to worry about it because you're
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:39.000]   in Taiwan and you get Netflix, but you only get four movies. They all have Bruce Lee in them.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.640]   They actually... I mean, I've had Netflix for... There are ways to get enough stuff. No, they're
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:52.280]   gonna crack down on it, dude. Did you see that? Well, they've cracked on it before
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:57.800]   to varying degrees to success. But I think they're more motivated to know that they've launched.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:02.280]   They officially launched in Taiwan. It's probably the 130 countries that they launched in Taiwan.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:05.720]   What movies? Is it a pretty good collection on Netflix, Taiwan?
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:13.640]   I don't know. I mostly... I subscribe for, which I think is their goal for their shows,
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:19.880]   which... Although they don't have in the US House of Cards, or they don't have in Taiwan.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.600]   Actually, they don't have... They don't have House of Cards in most markets.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.360]   Part of the reasons when they created it and where the reason they got off the ground was
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:32.040]   actually it was a joint deal where Sony actually kept the international rights.
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:36.760]   And so... Yeah, they aired... It actually aired on TV in Taiwan a couple of years ago.
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:40.920]   Well, do you have to make a murderer? Because that's a good one too.
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:48.440]   I do. But I haven't... For me, signing up for things like Netflix and HBO is mostly aspirational.
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:51.080]   Yeah. Some day I'll get to watch TV and go to the shows.
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.840]   People talk about that I say I'm going to watch and then I don't.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.840]   You thought it was a good idea to have your own business.
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.640]   I'm drastically behind on it.
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:02.920]   All right, well, we'll let you go because you got to go to work.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:05.320]   Hey, thank you all three of you. Really a pleasure.
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.040]   Thanks to all of you for watching the show. We love having you alive because then you're in
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:13.640]   the chat room and I know you're out there and I could feel your presence.
