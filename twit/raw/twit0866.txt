[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Evan Brown is here formally this weekend.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.880]   Law Larry Magad, CBS Radio, Carolina Milanesi.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.120]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.160]   Apple's big announcements.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.920]   Why did they put an eye?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.120]   iPhone chip in the new Max studio display.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.680]   I'll never understand that.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.640]   CNN starts streaming.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.040]   Is that the place to get your news?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.080]   In fact, where do people get news these days?
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.480]   And of course, an Amazon clubhouse contender.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.280]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.880]   Stay here.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.760]   Twit is next.

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.400]   Tech News got a great panel joining us.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.960]   Former host of This Week in Law with Denise Howell.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   I didn't realize it's been so long since you've
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.000]   been on the show, Evan Brown.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880]   He was on Twitter a couple of months ago,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.040]   but you haven't been on This Week in Law in a long time.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.480]   You know, 2014 time flies.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.400]   It really does.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   It really does fly.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.840]   Anyway, welcome back.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.640]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.440]   I always wish I had legal advice during this show.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.720]   So if you want to do it, I can today.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960]   You whisper in my ear and say, you
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.280]   can take the fifth on this, Leo.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   You can't.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.800]   I won't be glad to have that.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.000]   Also with his Larry Magan from connectsafely.org.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880]   You still do stuff on CBS, yes?
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.440]   I still do stuff on CBS, yes.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.600]   And Connect Safely is a great organization to help parents
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.160]   and children stay safe on the internet.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   Also joining us, the heart of tech, Carolina Milanesis.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.840]   Good to see you, Carolina.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.040]   Good to see you.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.080]   Good to see you.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.560]   Good to see you.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   I'm going to melt.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.960]   I'm going to melt right now.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   I just did it for you.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.160]   Oh, I love that.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.120]   I love Italian.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.080]   I'm really jealous.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.960]   Matthew Ingram is going to Perugia for the annual journalist.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.520]   Have you ever done that?
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.200]   Oh, nice.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.320]   Have you ever done that journalist concert?
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.840]   Perugia is beautiful, medieval city.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.640]   In fact, my sister lived there for six months
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.440]   to study Italian.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.080]   They have an Italian intensive program there.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.640]   They do.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520]   Yeah, it is a beautiful city.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.280]   And obviously, gorgeous chocolate.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.760]   Oh, obvious.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   Oh, no.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   I'm sold.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.680]   Obviously.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.720]   It's funny, because the Germans fight over who has the best
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.760]   versed.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.400]   The Italians, the Belgian, the French,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.800]   they fight over who has the best chocolate.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.960]   I'd take the chocolate over them.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.400]   Oh, we fight over everything.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.920]   Mine.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.400]   Right, right.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   Cheese.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.880]   Cheese.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.760]   Who has the best cheese?
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.120]   I don't know.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.400]   Let's try some more and find out.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.600]   So Carolina was watching with interest.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.440]   I saw your article as Apple unveiled new hardware on Tuesday.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.960]   Don't worry.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.400]   This is not going to be an all-Apple show.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.320]   But we have to mention it, because I
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.920]   think Apple has really shown some real skill and leadership
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.880]   in the chip field.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.600]   These Apple Silicon is just starting
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.120]   to lap the other guys in really remarkable ways.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.880]   The M1 Ultra, even Apple, was able to have a secret at this event.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.760]   Actually, the Mac Studio was kind of a secret.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.040]   In fact, if anything, this event showed
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.520]   that the rumor mongers can be very wrong.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.080]   They were talking about a Mac Mini that had plexiglass top.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.200]   They were talking about a 7K display,
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.600]   neither of which appeared.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.720]   We knew there'd be a iPhone SE.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.880]   That was pretty much on schedule.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.160]   The iPhone SE with 5G and a chip equivalent to the current iPhone
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.760]   13, a very powerful A15 chip.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.280]   They announced an iPad Pro with the M1 chip--
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.320]   no, not Pro.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.520]   iPad Air with the M1 chip, but verging on Pro territory.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   But the most interesting thing to me
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.280]   was this Apple Silicon in the Mac Studio.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.560]   And was it John Turnis or Johnny Suruji?
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.960]   I think it was John Turnis.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.520]   Apple, a senior vice president for hardware, said,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   we have one little thing we didn't tell anybody
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.240]   about with the M1 chip.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.000]   It has a built-in interconnect.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.480]   And as everybody predicted, the way
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.880]   Apple would move forward with their silicon, just
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.840]   as Intel and AMD have done, is to do multiple core architectures.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.400]   But when you're doing multi-core architectures with the M1,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.320]   each die has its own memory, its own AI processing,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.680]   its own video processing.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   And they glue them together, and the interconnect
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.800]   is the fastest interconnect anybody's ever seen.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.880]   So Apple has this really great story going forward.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.280]   In fact, everybody predicts you got the Ultra, which
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.480]   is two of them stacked, one on top of the other.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.720]   It's just a matter of time before you have four or eight
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.160]   or 16.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.120]   You could really disguise the limit.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   Very impressive processor.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.720]   The interconnect is 2.5 terabytes per second.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.960]   Kind of mind-blowing.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.040]   800 gigabits gigabytes per second memory bandwidth,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.640]   because remember the memory is unified memory.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.680]   It's on chip up to 64 cores in the GPU,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.960]   on the GPU rather, a 20-core CPU, 32-core neural engine.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.480]   But, Carolina, you were most interested in the display.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.760]   Yeah, I was interesting.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.280]   And first of all, the range that they showed,
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.200]   I think it was the first event where
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.400]   we saw pretty much Apple addressing the whole user base
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.520]   that they have, from the creators and the really demanding
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.880]   users with the Mac Studio, over way down to DSC,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.480]   user who are the most pragmatic users that you could possibly
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   have within the Apple ecosystem.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.040]   And not only because of the size, I think a lot of times
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.520]   we get focusing on how big is DSC.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.440]   No, it's really about familiarity of things like Touch ID
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.480]   instead of using Face ID.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.800]   I have to say, when you look at it, it looks like an old phone.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.240]   The Touch ID dates it.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   The big bezels date it a little bit.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.920]   The rounded corners.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.160]   It's the old design.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.520]   Who wants Touch ID?
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.680]   What's the Touch ID?
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.800]   Why do you like Touch ID?
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.880]   See?
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   I like it.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.360]   I've got it on my-- although I don't like the way
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.280]   Google implemented on the Pixel 6 with it on the screen.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.920]   But the new Touch ID with the Samsung and the Google,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.320]   that's all in screen technology.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.160]   But I'm good at both.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.320]   I actually have--
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.200]   I have an old-- this is not the phone I use normally,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.840]   but I have an old life.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.160]   Look at that.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.760]   This is, I think, the 6.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.560]   I actually use it for specific apps.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.160]   I don't even have a SIM card in it.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.520]   But the point I'm making here is that I
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.280]   like the Touch ID because it's positive.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.680]   It works well.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.400]   It works almost virtually all the time.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.320]   You don't have to worry about whether you've
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.440]   got a face mask on.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.760]   I know they're trying to fix all that.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.360]   But I just prefer it.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.320]   Is that why this is still around Carolina?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.520]   Because face masks?
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:36.920]   No.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.280]   And Apple has already fixed that with the software
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:42.840]   in the phone.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.360]   Or if you have an Apple Watch, you can definitely
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   open up your iPhone with a mask.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.800]   No, it is really about people that like what they know.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.720]   And to Larry's point, he has a 6.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.600]   And that's where the base is for the new OS is the 6, the 7,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   and the 8 that have been around for so long.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.640]   And also the fact that people that are a little bit more
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.360]   pragmatic and price sensitive don't want to pay for things
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.640]   that they're not actually using.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.600]   And so getting to that $400 price point with 5G,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.440]   the facet chips, you're giving them a phone
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.600]   that is going to last them four or five years, which is normally
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.440]   the life of a cycle of a more pragmatic user.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.080]   And for Apple, it's kind of a win,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.880]   because that means that those users can get to appreciate
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.520]   all the new features.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.760]   But more importantly, the services that Apple puts
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.880]   at their disposal.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.840]   And that's what it is.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.440]   It's about future proving your purchase as a consumer.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.120]   And for Apple, making sure that they
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.760]   bring those consumers with them as they drive more and more
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.840]   services.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.120]   This is what happened with-- I'm thinking back to the iPod--
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.040]   that the initial iPods were targeted at a higher end market.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.760]   But by the time the iPod had reached its full life cycle,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.680]   there was an iPod for every pocketbook, every need,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.480]   every desire.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.400]   That's how you double down on a product that is so successful.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.840]   There's none more successful than the iPhone.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.800]   Especially when you consider they're selling
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.480]   razors and razor blades, both at a profit, the idea
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.560]   that they're still making plenty of money on the SE.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.400]   And to the point, if people sign up for Apple services,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.280]   they're making money on an ongoing basis.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.960]   So get an Apple in their product.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.920]   And also, maybe they'll buy a Mac.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.800]   Maybe they'll buy another iPhone later on.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.720]   So it gets people into the ecosystem.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.640]   $450 is still expensive.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.160]   But it's comparable with the kind of--
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.960]   it's a mid-range price.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.760]   They're $200 and less--
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.280]   I mean, there are people who buy Android at that price
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.320]   all the time.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.280]   And if the only reason they're buying an Android
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.080]   is because they like the price point,
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.200]   Apple now has a competing product.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.000]   And so I think that's--
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.520]   And a better chip in it.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.600]   Usually, on the Android devices at that price point,
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   you do have somewhat of a compromise on the chipset
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.200]   that they use.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.240]   Because to be honest, if he knows offically,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.480]   on the Android side, there's a limit
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.240]   that the brands put on what they think those users want
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.600]   to do with their phones.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.400]   And Apple is not doing that, right?
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.120]   It's giving them the best chip for now that they have,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.680]   so that they can do what they want to do.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.320]   And some of the advantages of having the $8.15 by Yarnick
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.920]   is obviously the camera and doing more with just one lens.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.680]   This is a big problem in the Android world,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.320]   where you have a lot of phones that cannot be updated.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   You even can get phones, brand new phones,
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.280]   that aren't going to be guaranteed security updates
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.160]   next year.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.600]   So it's a--
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.280]   The only Android I only recommend pixels.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.640]   I mean, if you're going to buy an Android--
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.320]   I know a lot of people love Samsung.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.160]   But if you're going to buy an Android,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.800]   I really recommend a pixel, because you're
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.080]   going to get the latest software, you're
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.240]   going to get pure Android.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's the closest thing Google has to an iPhone.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.400]   And I just think it runs circles around any competitor
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.520]   out there in the Android world.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.280]   Samsung, which is, I think, the biggest seller
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.440]   of smartphones in the world.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.160]   Probably is, yeah.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.920]   Has said we are going to guarantee--
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   Right.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.160]   --after Huawei, yes.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.040]   Huawei in China.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.720]   Well, I'm saying after Huawei was cut off of Google, yes.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.240]   They have set four years of guaranteed updates.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.160]   So they are responding to that.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.960]   But how quickly will you get your update?
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.560]   Will you get a day one like an iPhone?
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.360]   You can will or--
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.640]   That's an interesting point, because I
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.480]   have the latest Samsung S22 Ultra,
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.920]   and it still has the January security update.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.280]   We're in March.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.080]   So that's a good point.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.600]   There's a little bit of it.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   They've still modified the OS and the apps
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.800]   that they have to do a lot of testing
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.480]   before they release that.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.040]   They are getting better, though, because they know that that
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.880]   is a lot, especially in the enterprise space,
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.040]   where they are trying to get more aggressive to compete
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.640]   with Apple.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.280]   So we should definitely see an improvement on the rollout.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.240]   And they also differentiate in less from the software.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.680]   They get in closer and closer to Google.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.120]   So let's pull it.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.200]   They're even using Google's messages
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.800]   as the default messenger, which is a huge shift for Samsung.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.720]   But you asked me about the display, right?
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.160]   Yes.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.760]   Because I thought that that was interesting,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.240]   as I was listening to the rollout of all the features.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.080]   I was expecting something around $3,000.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.840]   We know that the latest display that they launched a couple
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.560]   of years ago was $5,000.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.040]   And like, yeah, $3,000 with the brand.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.120]   But they came out with a quite aggressive price
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.520]   point in my view to be Apple and getting
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.760]   what you're getting with it, of $1,600.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.640]   And that made me really think about what Apple is changing
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.440]   is using-- first of all, using Silicon as a differentiator.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.600]   So we've seen the M1 go into an iPad Air, or honestly,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.440]   not something that I was expecting.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.400]   We've seen the A13 in the display to power some of these
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.680]   experiences like center stage.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.840]   And so using Silicon as a differentiator,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.280]   and then using a device like the display at a price point
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.520]   to appeal to a broader audience, they're not just
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.920]   the max studio potential buyers, right?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.120]   This is not just you buy the two because you're
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.400]   the most demanding users.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.320]   This is for somebody that might have a MacBook,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:37.160]   somebody that might have an iPad that wants not just a display.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.840]   You can get cheaper display with similar features.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.320]   But that end-to-end experience,
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.520]   so that you will get like center stage.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.600]   And yeah, you can use it with a PC as well,
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.960]   but some of those experiences are not going to be there.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.680]   I think one of-- I was very puzzled by the fact
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.200]   that they put an A13 bionic in a display.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.960]   That is the iPhone 11's processor.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.480]   That is a faster processor than they put in the Apple TV.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.560]   And yes, I guess it powers-- you can say, hey, Siri on it,
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.000]   although it still requires a computer to respond.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.880]   And yes, they have center stage on the camera,
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.360]   so they can zoom and pan as you're on your Zoom call.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.080]   But that seems like an awful lot to put an A13 in just
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.760]   for those things.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.880]   So I'm wondering if there is something down the road
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.240]   that Apple wants to do with this display.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.360]   I mean, it honestly could be an Apple TV.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.600]   I don't know if they put enough memory and storage in there
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.640]   to be an Apple TV, probably not.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.960]   But it could be, or it could be, a hub for your home kit.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.800]   There's things you could do with that.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.680]   You've put a lot of smarts into a monitor.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.360]   It's becoming more important, right?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.200]   We're doing this hours and hours of the day.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.520]   And I do think that screens will become way more important
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.840]   in the future as we talk about ambient computing.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.720]   And I agree with you.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.520]   I think it could become a hub or something around TV
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   or maybe around some of the services.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.720]   Like, what if you can run just on the display,
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.520]   something you're like Apple Fitness Plus as an example, right?
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.920]   The other reason they did it, of course, though,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.000]   is because-- and I think that this has proven the case
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440]   as the week has gone by.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.920]   They're going to phase out the big iMac, not just the iMac
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.320]   Pro, but just the 27-inch iMac.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.680]   And for the same price, you're going
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.120]   to get a separate Mac Studio display, which, you know,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.920]   when you put together, when you put the Mac Studio
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.120]   on that special tray under the screen,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.920]   it's very much like an iMac.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.760]   It makes sense to me.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.840]   It's an iMac deconstructed.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.240]   This is actually what I was hoping Apple would do.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.520]   And it was why I was going to buy a Mac Mini,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.040]   because I want to have a choice of displays,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.920]   a bigger choice than Apple can offer.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.840]   And I have a lot of 5K iMacs and iMac Pro.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.680]   And I feel a little hobbled because I can't--
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.760]   it's not very upgradable.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.640]   It's just what it is.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.320]   And so I think--
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   Isn't this Mac in the future, Leo?
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.360]   I think that was called the desktop PC.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.320]   Yeah, it's kind of--
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.600]   but it's in a very Apple way.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.840]   And by the way, I have to point out--
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.480]   and I don't know who did this.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.160]   It's very funny.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.000]   This is one of the publicity images
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.440]   they sent out a creative person using.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.600]   And the Mac Studio really is just a very fat Mac Mini.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.520]   But the top half is really where the fans go.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.680]   So I think what happened is they were trying to design it
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.840]   in the Mac Mini size.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.440]   And they realized, we've got to cool this sucker,
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.960]   especially the Ultra.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.560]   In fact, they have a copper sub-cooling subsystem in this,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.480]   which makes it two pounds heavier for the Ultra.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.120]   It's aluminum in the Mac and one at Mac's Mac Studio.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.160]   But notice, look carefully.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.080]   I don't know if anybody picked up on this.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.240]   At this plant in the background, it's in an old iMac.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.760]   Can you see that?
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.480]   It's in the trashcan iMac.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.040]   She's turned it into a flower pot.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.320]   Now, Apple has to have done that on purpose, right?
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.200]   Or somebody was somebody punking them.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.360]   Or maybe it just looks like--
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.640]   but I'm pretty sure that's--
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.160]   I think you can even see an Apple logo on there
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.080]   if you look really closely.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.680]   So I'm pretty sure that's a trashcan Mac in the background
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.280]   there.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.560]   That's not news.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.520]   Interesting.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.120]   I honestly feel like this is my theory.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.040]   There were two contingents in Apple during Johnny Ives era.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.360]   There was the Johnny Ives crew.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.320]   Wanted to be simpler, more beautiful.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.600]   They're trashcan Mac, a perfect example of that.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.400]   The thinner and thinner Mac books with the touch bar
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.840]   and the butterfly keyboard.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.440]   That's the Johnny Ives crew.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.360]   And then there was the functional crew who said, no,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.240]   it doesn't matter.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.680]   These are power tools.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.280]   They should be more functional.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.120]   And they won.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.320]   I've left.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.160]   The trashcan couldn't be upgraded.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.920]   Apple had to hang its head and shame and say, yeah, we blew it.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.040]   We can't upgrade this because the cooling design doesn't
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.240]   allow for it.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.000]   They got rid of the touchpad, touch bar.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.960]   They got rid of the butterfly keyboard.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.360]   This new Mac books even have HDMI ports on them,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.400]   which Johnny Ives must just be tearing his hair out.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.080]   And I think this is a little shot.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.480]   I hate to say it.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.080]   But I think this is a little shot.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.680]   This Mac trashcan Mac in the background design by Johnny Ives
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.280]   is a little shot at that crew.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.440]   I think they won.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.480]   And they're basically saying--
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.720]   Well, there's another person in the background too.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   Unfortunately, very much in the background, Steve Jobs,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   who was so--
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.760]   He was designed by Centric.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.840]   Yeah, he was a design fanatic.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.600]   And I'm not sure he would be in love with these new devices.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.800]   You know, you look at this fat boy, this thick Mac.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.400]   It isn't the most salubrious design.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   I don't think Steve Jobs would have loved it.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.280]   No, it's a little swole.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.440]   But it's purely functional.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.880]   And it's got the ports on the back.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.440]   I think the monitor has more ports.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.560]   I think they have four Type-C ports,
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.120]   one Thunderbolt 4.3 Type-C USB.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.920]   I would like to see more, especially since it has an I-13.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.440]   I feel like that monitor could be doing a lot more.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.760]   But what if the keyboard is very different now?
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.360]   This is the new keyboard too, which, by the way, you pay--
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.920]   I don't know what it is-- 50 bucks more for the black keys.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.800]   I didn't buy a black.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.080]   I've never seen an Apple black key.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.760]   This is new.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.720]   That's new.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.400]   They announced that as well.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.120]   And of course, if you're really a style of Maven,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.960]   you're going to want to pay the 50 bucks extra
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.640]   to get the black keys.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.280]   Well, if you can afford an I-Mac into a trash can,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.320]   you can afford 50 bucks for a--
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.440]   A flower pot.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.360]   Flower pot.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.200]   Probably doesn't make a very good flower pot.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.240]   But who knows?
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.280]   Anyway, I ordered the high end Mac Studio
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.440]   to arrive on Friday.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.960]   By the way, you got to order fast these days from Apple.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.480]   I guess probably because of the chip shortage,
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.840]   they say you could pre-order it right away.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.160]   Before Tim Cook even left the stage, I was in the store.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   If you order today, you're going to be
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.760]   waiting until April 26 for the high end and April 5 for the M1
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.080]   Pro-- I'm sorry, M1 Mac's version of the studio.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.440]   So a lot of people-- I've noticed a lot of edits
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.840]   putting that SD card slot under the Type C
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.200]   to make a little face.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.800]   I think Apple missed a bet there.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.560]   They could have been cute.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   They could have been smiling.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.440]   You know what's funny about that?
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.680]   If this were any other manufacturer of a computer,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.120]   nobody would come up with that idea.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.440]   Nobody would pay any attention to whether it's a face or not
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.040]   a face.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.640]   There's something about Apple people.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.680]   They're just a little--
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.920]   A little weird, a little different.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.480]   Anyway, if I were Intel, I would be a little bit nervous.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.400]   Intel keeps saying, oh no, we can make chips that are that fast.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.760]   But they use five times the amount of power, five times
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.600]   the heat, and you better not put them in a laptop
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.280]   or you're going to have a puddle of aluminum slag in your lap.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.440]   And I feel like just the beginning for the Apple Silicon.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.960]   They're really-- and they have such a huge advantage
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.600]   because the operating system is designed with the chip
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.680]   in mind, and vice versa.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.040]   This is essentially a Swift machine.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.120]   Pretty amazing.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.600]   It's a five nanometer process.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.200]   That's the other thing Intel's had a little trouble doing.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.760]   Does it also give Apple some independence
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.000]   in terms of like--
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.120]   I mean, I don't know where they're making these chips.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.000]   I assume in China--
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.680]   TSMC makes them.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.240]   So I mean--
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.600]   Yeah, in Taiwan.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.360]   In Taiwan, OK.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.280]   Well, I'm wondering whether Apple is becoming more of a master
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.760]   of its own domain by not having to depend on other companies
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.880]   for as many components, including obviously
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.520]   the vital components of the CPU as other companies
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.560]   they're having to do.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.240]   Yeah, actually, because of the geopolitical situation
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.400]   in the world these days, I think a lot of companies
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:14.640]   are really starting to say, hmm, chip shortage
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.040]   and so forth.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.880]   Apple has already started encouraging TSMC
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.080]   to building a plant in the United States.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.600]   They've started building plants in India, in Brazil,
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.720]   and other countries, Vietnam, I think.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.160]   So I think there is definitely-- this was Tim Cook's
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.600]   brilliant move early on, was to concentrate iPhone
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.400]   manufacture in China, get the skill set built up there.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.000]   Really was a smart move to get TSMC to be the foundry
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.360]   because of the skill set TSMC built.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.400]   They were able to build five nano chips long before Intel was.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.080]   So that was a brilliant move, but there's a change.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.200]   So that's why Intel is investing so much in the US.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.000]   And Intel wants to be a foundry too.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.360]   In fact, they want to supply Apple's chips.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   Yep.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.160]   Yeah, so it's--
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.160]   Hey, Leo, before we move off of this,
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.920]   tell me about what kind of task would max out that--
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.280]   Nothing.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:10.760]   --spect--
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.120]   Absolutely nothing.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.000]   This is the funny thing.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.600]   I mean, I ordered the Ultra.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.240]   I will never see those chips go to 100% ever.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.960]   Especially on that 2.5 terabyte transfer rate.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.360]   I mean, I can't even comprehend what that--
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.880]   Well--
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.840]   You need that for what would--
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.720]   Our Mac break weekly show, Alex Lindsay,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.200]   I'm sure you know of him, is does stuff.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.400]   There are applications.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.080]   He does something called photogrammetry,
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   which is 3D rendering of spaces.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.520]   And you have many, many, many points.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.200]   Photogrammetry is a very challenging way to do 3D modeling.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.040]   And he has found models that are almost impossible to render,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.000]   even on a high end Intel Mac.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.080]   So that's one thing, 3D modeling video, 8K video editing.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.320]   I mean, they always show somebody, I got 8K videos
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.200]   running at once.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.240]   I don't know why you would really need to do that.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.720]   Yeah, you can.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   If you're using logic and you've got an orchestra
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.520]   and every instrument has its own track,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.080]   I guess you could probably tap out the Ultra.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.960]   What Alex says is it's about time.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.880]   If you're a professional working in one of these fields,
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.560]   your time is extremely valuable.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.880]   And so it's worth it to spend money on hardware that
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.040]   does stuff faster, that saves you money in the long run.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.760]   So I think that's really it.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.440]   And of course, there's people like idiots like me
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.560]   who just say, but I want the fastest,
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.880]   though there's absolutely no number.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.240]   My crossword puzzles are not going to challenge
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.040]   that I'm one Ultra in any respect.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.000]   I'm going to have to actually go--
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.040]   Who is the world?
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   Is the world game?
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.880]   Is the world a game?
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.840]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.960]   That might help you.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.000]   I don't think so.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.040]   The fastest world ever.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   Even a Rubik's Cube solver, no, no problem.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.680]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.800]   So there are specialties like data science, like AI,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.160]   like video and 3D modeling.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.520]   There's real specialties.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.040]   But in the past, those have been very high-end workstations
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.560]   you don't hear a lot about, the people are buying.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.200]   It reminds you of people who buy the version of the Tesla
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.680]   that can go 160 miles an hour.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   A plan.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   And on what road?
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.400]   OK, yeah, I know there's a--
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.480]   It's like owning a Lamborghini, exactly.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.880]   And Apple's not-- you know, Apple's
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.760]   a very savvy marketing organization.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.200]   They know that people will buy these.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.440]   It also looks good for them because it reassures pros
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.760]   that Apple is still in this market.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   Absolutely.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   It's been a little scary.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.000]   I mean, the iPhone was so successful that I think a lot
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.640]   of Mac users were a little bit nervous that Apple would,
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.360]   you know, just lose interest in the Mac.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.560]   So this is a way to reassert their dominance in the field.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.760]   I think it's interesting, Caroline,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.800]   that you talk about the fact that these products are designed
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.880]   to reach a broad range of consumer price points,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.200]   broad range of consumer needs.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.280]   That's a smart thing to do for any technology company.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.160]   Absolutely.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.880]   And the fact that you're adding device to device
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.920]   to deliver more value, that's always been Apple's game.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.080]   But now that they have services, you know,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.240]   as I said, there's at the end of my article,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.680]   I think now with the services play,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.600]   Apple can play more, not pun intended,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.200]   with the price points or some of these devices
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:46.880]   to really hook people into their ecosystem even more
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.160]   than in the past.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.560]   You really-- I mean, it's an excellent point.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.400]   This is-- I can't think of another event
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.760]   where they've covered the very lowest end, the iPhone SE,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.400]   all the way up to what is currently the very highest end.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.440]   I mean, these Mac studio altars are actually faster
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.640]   than they're Intel Mac Pros by a significant amount,
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   almost twice as fast in some cases.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   That's a big jump in performance.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.920]   And what is fascinating is they can do that
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.840]   with their own silicon, right?
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.720]   So they can play up and down with the silicon
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.160]   to address all these users and then use that for their services
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.880]   and their application and their ecosystem.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.200]   It was one of the big advantages of the design
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.880]   of the new chip is that for all terms of purposes
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.640]   for the developer, it is one chip.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.520]   So you don't have to figure out how your app is going to run.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   And that's a huge advantage.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.360]   Again, as I'm convinced of Apple as big aspirations
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.920]   for the enterprise market, which is why--
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.840]   Really?
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.520]   Historically, very difficult for Apple.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.120]   Very true is a very different world, right?
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.960]   We are at the time where from a talent perspective,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.000]   giving employees what they want is absolutely critical.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.480]   And we just did a study, a crazy strategies.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.120]   And there's no question that people do want Macs
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.360]   in the enterprise space.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.000]   And so you started to--
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.560]   BYOD hugely changed enterprise IT.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.920]   Because of the iPhone, everybody wanted to bring an iPhone
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.800]   into the enterprise.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.160]   But wait, we gave you a BlackBerry.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.800]   I don't want a BlackBerry.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.880]   So you think the same thing's going to happen on the desktop?
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.520]   I think so, because with the M1 line,
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.040]   they can now make it much easier for IT decision maker
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.760]   to manage deploy, especially from an application perspective,
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.600]   something that they've already been doing for iOS.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.520]   And so the way I talk about it is not so much of a comparison
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.200]   between the Mac and the PC, but really the Mac and the iPhone
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.240]   and the iPad.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.560]   So if you put it in those terms, it's much easier for an IT
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.520]   manager to understand that the lift that they have to make
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.960]   for their apps is going to be less.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.200]   And I think that's the other part is like,
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.720]   all of this goodness is coming to something running on ARM
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.560]   that we've been waiting and been telling people
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.640]   that it was not going to happen.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.680]   And it is.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.480]   Whoops.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.360]   And Windows on ARM is still a pig.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.040]   Is it a factor that more people are working from home
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.640]   and that when people are working for a home,
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.480]   they want more children?
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   They choose what they want.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.640]   You want your house?
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   IT.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.720]   It's not just that though, it's going back and knowing
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.560]   that if you don't give people what they want,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.280]   people are going to go somewhere else.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.440]   I mean, the reality of the talent war is what it is.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.080]   It's not, you know, people sometimes think,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.120]   well, everybody has a mortgage to pay sure,
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.400]   but there's choices there.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.360]   And I think with hybrid work and remote work,
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.920]   there's more choice for people.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.600]   Because I don't have to necessarily relocate
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   to go and work for somebody else.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.160]   OK.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.720]   OK.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.480]   A couple of thoughts came to mind as we were talking about this.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.600]   One, maybe that's why you put an A13 Bionic into the monitor.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.120]   And now you can run iOS apps on your monitor.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.880]   I don't know how you would do that or what that would mean.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   I don't know if they put memory and storage in there,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.440]   but that's really weird.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.120]   They certainly were selling that as part
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.320]   of the benefits of Mac OS is that you can run your--
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.520]   the vast number of iOS apps.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.320]   Well, maybe they meant--
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.960]   maybe they wanted-- maybe that was it.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.680]   Maybe they wanted to put a touchscreen in there.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.680]   Maybe they will in the next generation.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.680]   That's interesting.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.040]   It's about time.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.560]   I don't know.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.960]   Apple said for a long time that he
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   didn't want touch screens, but at the same time,
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.840]   this is a new Apple.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.200]   This is not Johnny Ives Apple anymore.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.720]   I'm still skeptical or something like that,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.880]   because you don't take-- although I
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.480]   have a Surface Studio, which is an only one design that tilts,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.360]   and you can use it to do inking and drawing and everything else.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.320]   For the majority of people, if it visits just a regular screen
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.520]   so you don't have it close enough to you,
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.760]   it's just not practical.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.520]   You're not going to stay all day with your hand like that,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.000]   to do what you need to do.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.360]   I think it would make much more sense to have a MacBook,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.160]   please, with a touchscreen.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.800]   It's interesting.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.080]   It's a very clear line right now between the iPad
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.160]   line or the iOS line with touch and the desktop without touch.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.960]   I wonder if that line is of benefit to Apple
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.440]   so that they have a clear distinction
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.120]   between the two product lines.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.600]   They are muddying things with the iPad Air.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.040]   It's looking more like a pro, so maybe they don't know.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   It's fascinating to watch.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.720]   As Warren Buffett has said, it's a well-run company,
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.440]   so it's interesting to watch as they continue to strategize.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.520]   It looks like almost perfectly to build their market.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.480]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.760]   We've got lots more to talk about.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.200]   Carolina Milanesi is here.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   She's creative strategies as your analyst business, yes?
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.520]   What's the heart of tech?
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.880]   The heart of tech is helping companies.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.360]   So it's still a consultancy business,
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:23.120]   but focused on ESG and anything from diversity inclusion,
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.840]   to sustainability, to socially impact.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.120]   Nice.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.920]   God, no, your timing is very good.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.880]   Every company suddenly is trying to say,
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.000]   "What the hell do we keep moving from quitting?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   What do we do?"
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.520]   The heart of tech.com.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.200]   Larry Maggids here, he is, of course, connecting safely,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.160]   helping kids, families connect safely, connect safely.org.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.920]   That started as a passion project.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.720]   It did.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.800]   It goes back to 1994 when I wrote Child Safety
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.440]   on the Information Highway for the National Center
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.560]   for Missing Exploited Children.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.800]   Then I started safekids.com.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.840]   The other thing is we've evolved.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.120]   We started out around parents and kids,
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.480]   and we still, that's our sweet spot.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.680]   But we have an LGBTQ guide.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.760]   We have a dating guide.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.040]   We have three guides for seniors.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.800]   So we're expanding way beyond families and kids these days.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.440]   Front page right now,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.120]   how to talk with your kids about the war in Ukraine.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.160]   Right, exactly.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.120]   It's hard to be a parent these days.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.240]   I think that's great.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.600]   Hard to be a human being these days.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.800]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.400]   Mm-mm.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.760]   Fortunately, Evan Brown's a lawyer.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.360]   He doesn't have to worry about that.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.840]   Evan Brown, I'm just teasing.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.760]   Just a joke.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.800]   Just rise above it.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.760]   Just rise above it.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.600]   Evan the law.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.320]   What kind of internet cases implies you do internet law?
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.440]   Yeah, well, internet cases, I used to blog at internetcases.com.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.520]   Now, switch that over to Evan.law.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.440]   Internet cases still my Twitter handle.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.600]   So yeah, a lot of what I do touches on the internet by necessity.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.640]   My elevator pitches, I do technology and intellectual property.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.440]   So represent a lot of software companies and companies in other industries,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.600]   bringing in a technology solution.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.960]   So contracts, intellectual property.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.160]   Couldn't be a better see.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.920]   Better time to do that, boy.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   Also.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.480]   It's been a wonderful run so far these 20 years and every day gets more exciting as we all know.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.560]   Well, what's interesting, I mean, you're in an area that is rapidly changing
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.200]   and that the laws have not kept up with and so it's really an interesting thing
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:36.040]   as we try to grapple with technology legislatively and legally and so fast.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.320]   Yeah, there's always attention with innovation, people figuring out.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.120]   That's right.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.880]   To do new things, well, what are the rules?
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.680]   That's right.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:48.120]   Yeah, intellectually it's very satisfying to have the profession of thinking about these
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.320]   things and working with innovators and creative people.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.200]   That's the real delight in what I do.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.560]   Great to have all three of you.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.200]   Keith 512 and I chair him hilarious as he saw you on an old computer chronicles the other day.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.720]   We all time are sweet.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.840]   Many of us still living down those early TV.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.520]   Wait, you think a 286 chip is ever going to do?
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.480]   We need something that powerful.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.960]   I am really grateful to be an old-timer in this business because we have seen such changes.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:26.040]   When you and I were starting out, this was a very small hobbyist business, hobbyist industry
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:32.520]   and you had to go to a user group to figure out how to do this stuff and software came in
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.120]   Ziploc bags, Xerox, Mimeograph pages.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.040]   It's really changed dramatically in our lifetime and it's fascinating to watch.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.920]   I'm really...
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.480]   And the only reason I got any work going on is that I actually knew a teeny bit of technology
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.640]   and I knew how to write and there was almost no one who could do both of those things.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.040]   Same thing.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:56.520]   The combination of being able to talk in full sentences and knowing about technology is so rare.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.440]   David, how are you and me?
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.000]   It was a huge opportunity.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.720]   I showed you today speaking of opportunities brought to you by
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   Wealthfront. A lot of investment apps make it easy to start trading.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.560]   Maybe...
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.040]   I don't know, people like me say too easy, but just because it's easy doesn't mean you know
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.520]   what you're doing. Wealthfront's easy, makes it easy to invest, easy to grow your savings.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.320]   They have a very popular app.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.080]   So yeah, it's got an app 4.9 out of 5 stars in the Apple App Store.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.080]   So you can start investing in no time if you want to use their classic portfolio,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.200]   but you can also make it your own with things you care about.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.280]   They have funds. Yeah, look at that.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.960]   Cannabis, healthcare, socially responsible funds.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.640]   That's my preference.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.800]   If you want to invest in tech or crypto trusts, yes, they have crypto trusts as well.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.880]   Wealthfront was designed by financial experts to help you turn your interest,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.160]   your good ideas into great investments, but you don't have to do it all yourself.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.840]   For instance, if you don't want to spend hundreds of hours trying to lower your tax bill with tax
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.520]   loss harvesting, don't worry.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.000]   If you don't know about rebalancing or you're not sure what rebalancing is,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.200]   Wealthfront does that too automatically rebalancing your portfolio.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:16.440]   This is why it's trusted with $28 billion in assets, half a million people building their wealth,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:23.480]   steady, solid investments. All you need, $500 to get started, grow your wealth the easy way
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.720]   that Wealthfront do the work for you. You could do it right in the app.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   So you don't even have to put your phone down.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.120]   To start building your wealth and get your first $5,000 managed free for life,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.440]   yeah, go to wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.880]   W-e-a-l-t-h-f-r-o-n-t, wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.200]   Start building your wealth today.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.080]   It's easy.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.400]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.320]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in tech.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.400]   Please, you support us when you use that address.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.000]   Don't, you know, I know you're smart.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.800]   You could just go to the app store or go to wealthfront.com.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.280]   But if you would, just do me a favor, wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.400]   So they know you saw it here.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.440]   Thank you, Wealthfront, for your support.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:13.880]   Apple did not talk about new versions of Mac OS, new versions of iOS, new versions of iPadOS,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.640]   all of those will be coming early next week.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.280]   So there was, you know what?
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.120]   This was a case of Apple, a very tight 57-minute presentation.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.960]   Not a lot of frills.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:30.360]   In past years, Apple's remote presentations have had drone shots,
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.080]   and they were out in the desert or in the woods,
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.440]   and they had people coming through floors and through doors.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.000]   And remember, there's a lot more production value into this.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.680]   This one was very straightforward.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.200]   It was just like boom, boom, boom.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.160]   Maybe because of the amount of stuff they had to present,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.360]   maybe they didn't want to distract from the very interesting stuff they were saying.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.880]   Alex Lindsey on Macbrick quickly thought it was maybe because
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.600]   they're going to stop doing remote events.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.520]   They're going to start going back to in-person events,
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.320]   and they wanted to ease you back in.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.120]   -Ease people.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.800]   -Ease people back in.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.200]   Not the most exciting production value,
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.880]   but really very exciting content.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.520]   So pretty good.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.000]   All right.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.720]   I've been of every show we've done in the last three weeks
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.120]   have been about Ukraine and about the war in Ukraine.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.080]   There's a huge tech side to this.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.920]   Evan, I'm sure you'll have lots of stuff to say about it.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.840]   This is a --
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.480]   Well, I think the first thing we were talking about this in the radio show,
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.120]   I was very nervous.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.520]   There's two things that make me nervous about this war with Ukraine.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.680]   One is that it will heat up into World War III,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.000]   and that is still a risk.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.680]   Putin's a mad man, and we don't know what he's going to do,
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.640]   whether he'll use tactical nuclear weapons or chemical warfare.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:47.480]   And at what point do we say, all right, that's a bridge too far.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:47.960]   I don't know.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.520]   That's a terrifying prospect.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.960]   But even more proximate, I thought, was the risk of cyber warfare.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.880]   And that hasn't happened.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.920]   Any thoughts, Evan, why we haven't seen this hot cyber war or cold cyber war?
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:08.520]   I suppose the easiest answer is that we've been prepared for it,
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.320]   that security professionals have been able to foresee it and
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.800]   stop attacks that have occurred.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.200]   You only hear about the ones that are successful,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.800]   at least in the mainstream media.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.760]   We hear about those.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:29.400]   But this is perhaps a bit more cynical that there is a playbook of tactics.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.080]   And as things deteriorate from Russia's perspective in the Ukraine,
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.360]   or as it gets more entrenched, or however you want to characterize that,
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.440]   it's deteriorating for everyone.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.320]   Maybe there's more to come.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.760]   But I would like to think that there have indeed been attacks,
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.080]   and that we've been well protected because we've thought it through,
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.240]   and we have smart people thinking about cybersecurity on a day-to-day basis,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.480]   down where the rubber meets the road.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.120]   What do you think?
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.680]   Russia in the early days, before the war, used Ukraine as a kind of testing ground,
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   a proving ground for their attacks they brought their power grid down for a few hours,
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.800]   a couple of years ago.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.600]   Just before the invasion began, they shut down the financial system.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.800]   But in both cases, it only lasted a few hours.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:24.280]   And I'm wondering if maybe Ukraine got the message and hardened its cyber defenses before the war began.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.400]   That'd be my guess.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.200]   I thought we were very vulnerable.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.720]   You know, US intelligence estimates 75% of all ransomware attacks come from Russia,
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:42.520]   either because they are tacitly supported by Russia, or Russia's turning a blind eye to them.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.440]   But I don't think it's an accident that 75% of all ransomware comes out of Russia,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.200]   including, by the way, the colonial pipeline shut down,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.920]   which is a big infrastructure attack in the US from a Russian hacking group called Darkside.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.280]   We don't know if Putin was behind that or just turned a blind eye to it.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:07.960]   But I think in a way, in 2018, we founded CISA, which was all about infrastructure,
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:13.640]   cyber defense in the United States, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:19.880]   And maybe they deserve some credit for doing a good job, as you said, Evan, and locking stuff down.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:29.160]   Or maybe that mad dog hasn't been cornered quite enough to let loose the hounds of hacker hell.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:36.520]   I have a feeling that what you just said is more likely that they have an arsenal.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.760]   And clearly, if you look at what's going on in the ground in Ukraine or in the air in Ukraine,
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.880]   they have a lot of tools in their tool chest that they haven't brought out yet.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.400]   So it would not surprise me if Russia has plans.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:53.720]   We've hardened enough that they had to hold off on the plans, but I wouldn't
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.200]   breathe a sigh of relief anytime soon around cyber attacks in the US.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.960]   The other possibilities is it's the same thing that kept us from nuclear war for so many years,
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.120]   mutually assured destruction. They have their hackers, but we have ours.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   Maybe they're afraid of what we might do back. I don't know. Maybe they're more vulnerable.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.440]   Anonymous is already on the case. I don't know how they're doing.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:25.800]   Going after Russia. It's interesting to see how everyday folks in Russia are already suffering
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:31.880]   in many of the ways that we would if there were a cyber attack that we can anticipate,
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.280]   for example, in the financial systems. If you can't get your money out of the bank,
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.040]   that's going to cause a real problem that's going to have a ripple effect into so many areas.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:46.520]   Well, you can turn on the news and see folks in everyday Russians trying to get money from the
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.960]   ATMs, particularly folks who have US dollars. So sad. So sad.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.440]   You could have turned on the news last week. Now, if you turn on the news, we don't have any
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:00.120]   correspondence working at a Russia video. We'll never know. Who knows what's going on there.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.600]   Although we're seeing lots of videos, cell phone videos, the world has changed dramatically.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.920]   And we were seeing lots of cell phone videos smuggled out of Russia by Russians who were against the
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.560]   war. I think we'll have boots on the ground sort of in Russia for some time to come.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.760]   I push a good telegram channel. Telegram. Yeah.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:28.440]   Maybe a piece of evidence, maybe not. Russia clearly was developing the ability to shut down
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.400]   the Ukrainian power grid that they definitely were making efforts along that line.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.840]   And I think they would if they could at this point, they tried to do it by bombing two nuclear
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   plants, which is crazy, very dangerous. If they had that cyber ability, I think they would have done
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.120]   it. And I think they must not have that ability that somehow Ukraine has prepared itself. I
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:46:00.040]   hope so too. A little different attacking the US. That might be a provocation that Russia does
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:06.520]   not get ready to engage in. And I think for your point, go ahead, Carolina.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:11.960]   I was just going to say to your point about, you know, money, people struggling with money
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:19.000]   and everything, we have cut back on access to technology so much already, not just from
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.960]   a government perspective, but you know, tech has cut back in supplying, you know, everything
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:34.600]   from chipset to memory to all the key ingredients, if you like, for them to be able to continue to
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:44.840]   operate in a manner. And then you have connectivity issues. And I think all of that puts them in a
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:51.480]   weaker spot when it comes to, you know, going and attacking somebody else from a cyber perspective.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.720]   It's too early to say this, but I'm going to say it anyway, because I have high hopes.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.680]   It's possible Russia could lose that they actually could lose this.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:07.960]   That Ukraine could triumph. I think it's looking more and more like that might happen.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.480]   I think that's really a binary question though. Maybe not. I, you know, I think what's pretty
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   clear is that Putin is not going to stop. He's not going to say, oh, yeah, let's have peace talks.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.640]   Okay, fine. You don't, you know, you can run your country the way you want to.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.600]   I think the Russian bear has to be defeated. I don't think it's going to give up.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:29.080]   But I think it's a possibility. And I think maybe Putin should be thinking about his own
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:35.400]   tail right now. You wrote a piece, Larry, on Connect Safely, Russian cyber attacks are possible,
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.040]   be prepared, but not panic. Now you wrote that earlier this month. I don't know.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.320]   Right. What do you think?
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.720]   Well, I think, you know, the points we've been making is that I actually did expect to see
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:52.520]   something by now in the United States. And I'm, as I said, I'm not breathing any size of relief
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.840]   that we're not in the future. But I think what's, what will happen is that people will be indirectly
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.480]   affected. And I, you know, I took the, in this article, I kind of took the worst case scenario
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.600]   that maybe you should have some extra cash on hand because they could shut down the financial
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.560]   system. I don't say they will, but theoretically they could, they could impact it. It's always a
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.200]   good idea to have extra food, next to water on hand. It's always a good idea to have ways of
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.280]   charging your smartphones. And, you know, the usual things, and by the way, everything that I
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:26.920]   said in this article applies to earthquakes, fires, any disaster, man-made or natural. So I'm
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:32.360]   not urging people, you know, take any extraordinary precautions. I'm just saying that in a period of
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:38.120]   uncertainty, it's not a bad idea to have, you know, a few hundred bucks. If you can, if you can put
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:44.440]   that much together in a safe in your house, not a bad idea, batteries, a way to charge
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.880]   your cell phone from your car, you know, etc, etc, because it could happen. Probably won't,
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.760]   but it could happen. The reason this is a tech story is because we are singularly more vulnerable
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:00.760]   because we are so reliant on tech, we've kind of put ourself in this position, right? Yeah.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:06.600]   Well, absolutely. I mean, you could think about even, you know, when, when Facebook goes down for
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:13.240]   two hours, it's a front page story. Yeah. Okay. You know, what did we do 20 years ago? We didn't
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.960]   have Facebook. Well, we managed to survive. But tech has become an important point. And one of the
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.920]   things that I'm very pleased about is the cellular network is apparently working in Ukraine. I mean,
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:29.240]   I just saw today people being interviewed from their phones in Ukraine. So there is infrastructure,
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:34.280]   but it's all, it's all vulnerable. And if it goes down, those reports that we're getting are going
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:39.720]   to disappear along with it. So, you know, technology is our lifeline right now, both in the United
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:47.480]   States and still in Ukraine. Nick Clegg, who is now the minister for propaganda. I'm sorry. The
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:56.280]   senior vice president at Meda in charge of global affairs tweeted responding to reports the
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:01.880]   Russian government is considering designating Meda as an extremist organization for its politics
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.520]   or policies in supportive speech. By the way, I'm sure Nick, like, just loves being able to
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:14.280]   say that. See, we're important. He says there's been a lot of coverage. I want to be clear. Our
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.880]   policies are focused on protecting people's right to speech. You know, this is really just taking
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:27.320]   this kind of annoys me. It really feels like taking a horrid situation and making public
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:36.040]   relations points out of it. We're only going to, to be the fact is if we applied our standard
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:41.400]   content policies without any adjustments, we would be now removing content from ordinary Ukrainians,
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.960]   expressing the resistance of fury at the invading military forces, which would rightly be viewed as
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:51.480]   unacceptable. We're going to only apply this policy in Ukraine itself. We have no quarrel with the
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.200]   Russian people. There's no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as Russian people
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.560]   are concerned. They're in a tough position. We will not tolerate Russophobia.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:06.920]   There's a new word. "Ernie" kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:13.960]   platform. Okay. I wouldn't want to be in this. The slippery slope though as well, right?
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:23.240]   I understand where they're coming from, but are you going to say the same thing when people here
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:34.200]   start to make their voices heard about voting rights or the say no gay bill or anything else that's
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:41.640]   going on in this country? Indeed. This really does touch on the heart of the problem of content
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:51.160]   moderation. I see it as a danger of placing these sorts of powers in the hands of private industry
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:58.280]   where there can be a model applied that differs from the standards and the analysis coming from
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.400]   those standards under the First Amendment or other free speech principles in other countries
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:09.960]   around the world. It really does expose a weakness in the approach here when I don't know that
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:15.560]   reasonable people could disagree that there is a certain amount of arbitrariness guiding these
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:23.000]   judgments. For example, what Facebook is making, allowing posts, inciting violence so long as it
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.640]   fits in categories that are defined, certainly using words here, but there always is a subjective
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.480]   amount of judgment as to where those contours of those categories lie. This really is pointing
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:42.760]   out a weakness in the overall problem that we're seeing here. I would not want to be in their shoes.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:48.360]   That's for sure. It's one of the reasons why Dr. Berg keeps talking about why he supports
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:54.120]   legislation or regulations. I think part of it is they would like to get off the hook. I think
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:59.560]   that Facebook has gotten itself into a very tough position of being an arbiter of speech
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:06.040]   where they know it's above their pay grade. It is not something that private companies should do.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.680]   Sure, they have a right to do it on their platform, but given the size of their platform and the
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.480]   power of their platform, should they have that right or should that right belong to somebody who's
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:20.120]   accountable to the people? Then you get to the question what that means and to what people.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:24.840]   But it's a very tough situation. I've talked to people at Facebook who really,
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.520]   you can say all you want about the negatives of Facebook and there are plenty of good things
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.920]   to say about that. There are people who are really struggling with these issues about
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:39.960]   which right do we enforce? Which right do we impinge on? It's hard for a private company to do that.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.680]   It's hard. Evan, you're a lawyer. You understand the complexity that our legal system deals with
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:49.000]   and why we have a Supreme Court? Could these issues are hard even for learned judges?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.480]   I really like that you said that, Larry, because a platform is in a double bind because you pointed
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:01.240]   out and I think you made a very rational proposition that this ought to be done or it may improve if
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:08.040]   it's done when there is accountability to the people. Well, who is it then that is responsible
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.280]   usually who plays that role of accountability to the people? Well, that's the government.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:19.800]   So then what do we need to do then to ensure that there is appropriate application of the
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.200]   principles that the government is obligated to deal with, namely in the United States, the First
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:31.960]   Amendment? How do we do that in a way that is even-handed? Fair. I would submit that there's
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.760]   probably not much more to do other than apply those First Amendment principles that have developed
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:44.680]   over the last 240 some years. So it's all a matter of bringing it in and contextualizing it and
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:50.200]   making it appropriate to where we are now. And I think that we can be optimistic to think that
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:57.080]   there are approaches that are going to be viewpoint neutral, still protective of certain classes of
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:02.120]   people, for example, people who are the targets of violent threats or hate speech or defamation,
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.360]   those things that don't enjoy First Amendment protection. It's all a matter of figuring out
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:10.520]   how to do it. The first step is figuring out what principles ought to apply, but we can get there.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.480]   I think. But it's hard enough to track things in one country. They're trying to do policy for
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:20.440]   almost 200 countries. How do they even begin to do that? I mean, not every country has a First
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:27.160]   Amendment. Well, you could do what Mark Zuckerberg did. Mark and Cheryl said, "Hey, Nick, you handle
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:35.480]   that. And we're a foreign accent." You know, you this is, I, Nick, like kind of basically got,
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.120]   they handed him a shovel and they said, "See those stables? Have fun, Nick. We're going to stay over
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.920]   here. We're going to build the blue platform. We're going to run the operation and Nick's in
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.640]   church. Go talk to Nick. And now he's the poster boy for this. I hope he's getting it. I'm sure
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:54.440]   hope he gets plenty of money. I hope he's getting a good salary. He's not a stranger to this
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:59.560]   foreign minister in the UK government. What about Gordon? Go ahead.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:06.120]   Sorry. I just wanted you to say, we can also be blind of the fact, in my opinion, that, you know,
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   talking about accountability, if you are the platform owner, you are accountable. And the only
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:18.360]   reason why Zuckerberg is saying we welcome legislations is because one he knows that by the time somebody's
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:23.240]   going to make a decision is going to be, you know, we're right into the middle of the metaverse
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:29.240]   that people are still trying to figure out Facebook. And two, that he hopes that that
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:35.320]   legislation is going to be used against competitors and not just for Facebook.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:39.960]   They call regulatory capture. You know, pull up the ladder behind you. We made it. We can do
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.920]   whatever they want. I mean, big telecom is always benefited from regulations. Yeah. And
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.560]   there are reasons why big tech might as well. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.920]   I want to talk about DuckDuckGo in a little bit, but we also need to take a break. Great panel.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:59.720]   Evan Brown, Carolina, Mina Nasey and Larry Maggud all joining us to talk about the world
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:05.880]   around us. Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology and checkpoint.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.960]   If you want to talk about security, let's talk about it because no matter whether it's a
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:18.840]   the global political situation, war in Ukraine, hackers on your back door, we always have to be
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:25.240]   as secure as possible, especially in business. WWT is the best partner for any enterprise.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:31.240]   They offer security solutions and services to protect your business. Remember, attackers are
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:36.280]   always updating their strategies, always finding new ways to attack. WWT is going to help your
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:43.880]   organization prepare for and combat next generation threats. But to do that, you've got to have a
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.840]   company that has the vision, the services, the capabilities to deliver those security controls
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:54.600]   to reduce the risk for your organization. They've got their ears to the ground, their nose to the wind.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:01.640]   They're prepared to protect you against all attacks, including future attacks.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:08.600]   WWT's team provides resources and platforms to make it possible. They've been doing it for
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.400]   three decades. So they've got a proven track record, but they're also focused on the future.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.200]   And they are very, very well aware of what's going on. I'll give you a few case studies you
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   can think about. You'll find lots more at www.wt.com/twit. They worked with a large healthcare
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:29.160]   organization. They were about to move to a certified electronic health record technology.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:35.800]   That is hard. All by itself, WWT was brought in to conduct a security risk assessment.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:41.560]   WWT's experts came in and used expert knowledge, state-of-the-art tools in depth analysis.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:48.200]   They even worked with the staff to do training and repetition. By the end of the assessment,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:53.720]   of course, they'd made this healthcare organization confident. They also found that 90% of the
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:58.680]   vulnerabilities they'd found could simply be fixed by putting in a comprehensive systematic
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   approach for patching. And they did that. They implemented that and they gave that
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.680]   healthcare organization. You'd know the name, a real sense of security going forward.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.080]   They worked with a big retail bank. Again, you'd know the name to help them achieve
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:18.920]   their goal of having an infrastructure that could survive a catastrophic cybersecurity event.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:24.280]   Through infrastructure automation, ongoing cost savings, they also reduced system
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:30.200]   outages by 40%. Tangible results, not just the intangible, what we think we're safe now.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:35.720]   They made a big difference. WWT does it with a variety of security solutions, risk management,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.440]   endpoint security, network security. They can help you with your identity and access management.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:45.320]   That's really important to you. You know that when somebody's accessing your resources,
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:51.400]   they're doing it to the right people doing it at the right time. That's super important.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:56.360]   That zero knowledge architecture now is being adopted by something the biggest tech companies.
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.920]   WWT can help you implement it in your own company. They also will help you with your
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:06.920]   cloud security, increase data protection, ensure compliance, and achieve a more consistent
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:12.440]   application of security policies. Even if you're a multi-homed cloud, they can do it.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.520]   They've got the skill. That's the idea. See how WWT and checkpoint can protect your business assets
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:26.440]   and intellectual property with a holistic security approach. Go to www.wt.com/twit to get started.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:35.800]   Let worldwide technology help you at www.wt.com/twit. Now more than ever, you need WWT
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:42.440]   to make that new world happen. And they're there for you. www.wt.com/twit. We thank them so much for their
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:50.360]   support. Dr. Go got in a stew pot of trouble. When their chief executive Gabriel Weinberg tweeted
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:57.400]   Thursday, the search engine would rank websites "associated with disinformation, lower in search
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.400]   results." Not knock them off the internet, but just lower in search results. It's later come out.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.960]   They maybe didn't have that much choice because they rely on Microsoft Bing for their search
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:13.560]   results. I did not know that, but now I do. Bing said that they were going to follow the
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:20.600]   European Union's order to restrict access to RT and Sputnik. What I was surprised is,
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.440]   I thought, "Yeah, of course they're going to do that. I think I'm sure Google's doing it too."
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:33.160]   But I was surprised at the firestorm that generated. A libertarian, YouTube user,
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.560]   Tarle Warwick, with half a million followers said, "If you're using DuckDuckGo,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:44.200]   I suggest you stop using it and switch to something else." BrightBart, the right-wing
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.400]   news organization, said, "A DuckGo is adopting the censorship policies of big tech."
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:57.480]   In social media channels devoted to conspiracy theories, users vowed to switch to Yandex,
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:04.920]   the Russian search engine. This is why when you say, "We've got a governmental solution,"
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.120]   and so forth, we are so divided as a nation that people would get upset with a search engine
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.160]   saying, "Yeah, we're not going to include propaganda from a warm, mongering country
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.080]   and their search results would upset people in the US."
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:25.400]   It's appropriate, is it not? I mean, maybe not.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.440]   Have you been watching Tucker Carlson lately?
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:28.600]   No.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.680]   What's he say?
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:36.120]   Mainstreaming Russian propaganda. Oh, he's very clever. We were watching him the night of the
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.680]   invasion, and he was on the air two or three hours before the invasion going on and on about,
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.200]   "Oh, did Putin call you a racist? Did Putin steal your job? Why should you hate Putin?"
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.040]   And then the invasion happens, and I say to my wife, I said, "Tomorrow night, he's going to
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.840]   have to backpedal somewhat. He can't possibly keep this going." And sure enough, the next night
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:01.000]   comes to the television and he says, "Yeah, I don't like what Putin did, but by the way, it's all
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.720]   because they're NATO with a Putin doorstep." And he basically said, "We've just defied the
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:11.320]   fact that we should give him what he wants." And so, I mean, he's going on and on.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:18.360]   I mean, look, it's his right. I don't think, though, that it's also appropriate for
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:25.480]   big tech companies like DuckDuckGo to say, "We want to curtail the spread of Russian propaganda."
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.880]   I don't know. Is that wrong? Should a search engine be completely agnostic?
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:35.400]   I have a lot of other people speak. If you had asked me this 15 years ago, I probably would have
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.480]   said it was wrong because I was a free speech purist. And I think over time, we have learned
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   that just like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, just like you can't send out
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.360]   pictures of sexually explicit pictures of children, there are certain limits to speech.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.720]   And the old me never would have allowed the new me to get away with saying that, but
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.640]   I think history has proven that we have to have at least a private sector,
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.040]   public sector, a different story. The First Amendment, as you know, applies to government.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.520]   Government cannot make a law abridging speech, but that's not what this is.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.480]   Private sector can do this.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.000]   And all search engines make decisions all the time. Editorial decisions about what
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.080]   content they rank highly and not. It's not like they took it off the internet. They just lowered
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.440]   the ranking. I don't know. That doesn't offend me. And I was very surprised to hear
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:31.080]   how upset people were. And it made me actually think, "Oh, maybe I do believe that search results
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:37.640]   should be completely agnostic." Evan, what do you think?
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:48.520]   Well, I'm cautious in saying that there ought to be clear categories here for a search engine
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:57.240]   to deprioritize, especially when you hold the principles like what DuckDuckGo does, where it
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:05.080]   purports to be very neutral in this. I hear what you're saying, "Leo, search engines,"
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   certainly, "make decisions all the time about what content is there."
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.960]   That's actually the nature of a search engine.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.480]   Right. And I'm much more satisfied when that's done algorithmically based on certain things like
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   basic things that happen in the algorithm, like, "Well, how much is it linked to what's its page
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.360]   rank?" But at the same time, you might also deprecate sources. Google does it all the time.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.760]   That's a spammy source, for instance.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:44.280]   Yeah. But there's a certain part of me that once there to still remain with a certain
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:51.160]   sense of agency in the end user, to be able to look at this content and evaluate its truth
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:58.360]   valence. For example, I'm a bit upset, it's way too strong of a word, but certainly disappointed
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:07.800]   to see that YouTube took RT offline. I was benefiting greatly, learning about the contours
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:15.080]   of this dispute by watching RT. I didn't believe most of what it was, but it helped me gain a robust,
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.360]   more deep understanding of the nature of the conflict.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.600]   And now I'm not going to have that. What the perspective in Russia is what the Russian people
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.800]   are being told. And so you think that companies, tech companies should trust,
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.120]   it's a little paternalistic to say, "Oh, we don't want to show you that information,"
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.520]   because we don't trust your ability to discriminate, so we're going to do it for you.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   Yes. I'm eager to hear what Carolina has to say about this.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:51.480]   Well, no, I agree. I think it's basically saying that user readers cannot make up their mind as to
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.160]   what is true and what isn't. Now, we do also know that there are users who are
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:09.560]   maybe less in tune with how the internet works or that might be. And I'm not talking about the
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:18.120]   warrior being general that might need to be safeguarded from some information.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:27.400]   But you can't always make the decision for them, because I agree, otherwise you create a bubble.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:34.760]   And I think that in the tech sector, we are sometime. And I talk about, from my experience,
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:43.000]   think about how you use Twitter, where you follow people that tend to be people that you agree with,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.080]   people that share your likes and dislike that might be similarly politically inclined or whatever
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:58.680]   the case might be. You do end up in a bubble and you don't understand what others are listening or
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:05.640]   hearing and how they make up their reasoning. And I think that to your point,
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:11.400]   your earlier about the state, this country is in right now, is that we are not
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:19.640]   we're not really listening to each other anymore. And so having both sides of the equation, I think
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:29.320]   is important. I certainly wouldn't want Silicon Valley to be able to say, Oh, look, our point,
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.520]   our worldview, our global view is the only global view. This is what you and so that's the risk of
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:41.480]   letting a tech company decide with their own agenda what we should be able to see and not.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:47.640]   You can still go to RT.com Evan and watch this right there. Oh, thank goodness. Yeah. So it's
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.040]   and I so really was more. So if I do that, you know, I can see it if I go to YouTube, it says,
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:59.240]   but but I think that that's the point, I guess is maybe YouTube was more paternalistic and didn't
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   trust its audience. And maybe there's some case for that. It's funny because I'm sure YouTube would
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:08.920]   fight it if they were brought to let's say Congress to testify about their algorithm and its
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.000]   tendency to make people more extreme. They might say, Oh, we don't have that kind of influence,
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:21.080]   but they still pull down our team. I would certainly be willing to stand up for YouTube and it's
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:29.640]   prerogative is the word I'll use to do this. I don't want to say right because I think that's a
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:35.320]   bit too fundamental, but and that's enshrined, you know, for example, in section 230, where,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:42.120]   you know, these platforms can make these editorial judgments for content that is unlawful, you know,
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:48.600]   lewd, lascivious, or otherwise objectionable is the categories that are there in the statute. So I
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.080]   don't think there's anything unlawful about what YouTube did. And I don't think any of us are
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.480]   suggesting that as well. This is a much deeper, a more even deeper than what policy questions go.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.160]   This is philosophical. This is, you know, whatever is at that layer. These are the kinds of perspectives
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.240]   I think we need to think about this. And I think it's, I think it's important to try to get outside
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   your bubble. I mean, I actually divide my television news viewing between Fox, MSNBC and CNN, because
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.720]   I want to hear the different perspectives. I want to hear what Tucker Carlson is saying.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.480]   I want to hear what Fox and by the way, Fox has some amazing journalists like
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:28.440]   Gwynne for Griffin, Jennifer, Kim, her last name, but she has Jennifer Griffin, Pentagon,
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.960]   Pentagon correspondent is rock solid. And she'll argue with the with with Carlson and
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.120]   Hanavy. But my point is that it's important to get out that bubble. And I do want to see RT. I go to
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.080]   RT.com because I want to see that perspective. I go to Breitbart.com. And I think it's pretty
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:49.160]   probably obvious by now that these organizations don't reflect my world view. But it's important,
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.320]   I think, to have a broader sense of what's going on. And one of the things that bothers me about
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:58.120]   modern media, including social media, is how people are being pushed into bubbles, they're being pushed
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:05.240]   into into these very narrow tribes. And I think that's detrimental to intellectual curiosity,
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.680]   as well as democracy. Absolutely.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:20.040]   It's so hard to know where to draw the line. It is very tempting to be a little paternalistic and
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.920]   say, well, I know the difference. I can go to RT.com. I could tell that's propaganda, but I don't think
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:33.400]   we should let everybody do that. And I, and I, and I, well, it's just it's, it's, it's a little thorny.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:39.320]   My, you know, my, like you, Larry, my initial feelings in the early days of the internet,
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.360]   certainly, was this is only beneficial for everybody to get every point of view. And you could trust
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   them to decide and to use this information to make their own decision. And yes, we may not agree,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.680]   but that's the nature of the world. And this is a great benefit to everybody to have every point
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:04.920]   of view. You know, during World War II, you couldn't listen to Gebel's, you know, broadcast in Germany,
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.120]   but you know, you could hear Tokyo rose and you know, you could, you weren't cut off from the German
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:15.240]   point of view or the Japanese point of view during the war. But at this, at the same time,
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.920]   RT has a big fat pipeline right into the US. And they're very subtle, by the way, as I look at it,
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.720]   doesn't look, it's not obvious propaganda. You're right. Yeah. They're very subtle.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:31.480]   But it's interesting that you talk about different point of views because to the point of
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:41.800]   subtle versus not, we're still not necessarily even for TV stations or, you know, newspapers,
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:49.160]   always getting everybody's point of view in as much as how this story is stored, because
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:56.280]   you just need to see the difference that we're using to talk about the Ukraine and how people
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:06.840]   are fighting Russia and you know, the invasion. And we speak very differently about other parts
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:13.160]   of the world, where is the same situation people fighting for their land, to defend themselves
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:20.760]   in their loved one, but they so happen not to be in a country that matters more to the, you know,
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:27.160]   peace in the world in Europe. They might not have nuclear powers that are concerned for everybody
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:34.280]   else. And you know, they have the skin is a different color. And so we treat them differently.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.240]   Yeah. I mean, this has been going on in Syria for a decade. Absolutely.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.600]   Yeah. I mean, you know, we hear a lot about Syria, I think, in comparison to what happens in Africa.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.680]   Like I've mentioned, if you pulled a hundred Americans to tell you about the significance of
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:54.520]   the Second Congo War, very few of those hundred would be able to tell you even one fact about that.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:00.600]   But it was an incredibly bloody conflict. And you know, we just don't know about it.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:07.000]   Right. And there's that there's there's there's no interest right from, yeah, from an oil perspective.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.040]   And if anything else, your crane is European. And so we, you know, we care about that.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   Yeah, that's a little shameful. I agree. TikTok. TikTok. Let's talk a little bit about TikTok.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:28.280]   You may remember last year under President Trump, there was pressure to sell TikTok to an American
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:34.680]   company oracle was in the bidding. In fact, Oracle was expected to win. That did not happen
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.160]   when the Biden administration came in, you know, just it kind of drifted off the horizon.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:48.120]   I wasn't so much concerned about America, America's data being held in China, as I was about the
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:56.600]   incredible propaganda potentials for TikTok. Well, there's two stories this week that reflect both
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:04.120]   sides of that story. TikTok has moved ahead in its deal with Oracle. For Oracle to store TikTok
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:11.000]   data about American users so that by dances, China parent can't access it. So in a way,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.920]   that's kind of that deal never did die. This is because CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:24.600]   in the United States has continued with, you know, without abatement to talk about its concerns
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:31.560]   over data security. So Oracle will be holding Americans information in the United States
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.960]   in an Oracle database. And maybe that makes you feel better because China doesn't have access to
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.360]   your data. They still have access to whatever you do on your phone, which maybe is even more
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:48.280]   concerned. My biggest concern, frankly, is that TikTok could be very easily algorithmically tuned
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.920]   in the same subtle way that RT is to become a propaganda platform for China. The White House,
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:01.000]   this actually was a Saturday Night Live skit last night. The White House, but it's a true story,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.760]   brought TikTok stars in to talk about the war in Ukraine. Brief them, Jennifer Psaki, the
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:17.080]   Press Secretary, briefed influencers about the United States' strategic goals in the region.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.280]   No, my son was not included in that. Although he had more followers than a lot of these TikTok
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:29.160]   influencers. I'm just saying you were somebody recorded the call and you could listen in on it.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.840]   And it wasn't exactly a deep inside briefing, but I think it was very much an attempt
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:42.040]   by the Biden administration to get these TikTokers to espouse the American point of view
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:50.360]   on their channel. Khalil Green, 21, a creator with more than 534,000 followers on TikTok,
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:55.080]   said he wasn't surprised when an invitation arrived in his email inbox. This is from the
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.360]   Washington Post. "People in my generation could all our information from TikTok," he said.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.880]   "It's the first place we're searching up new topics and learning about things."
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:13.160]   I guess you got to go where the kids are. I wonder if Jen Psaki said hello fellow kids.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:24.040]   Some of the creators said it wasn't a lot of information in there. Jules Turpek, a Gen Z
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.240]   content creator who does essays about digital culture,
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:32.680]   said the White House decision to engage creators such as she was essential in helping to stop
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:38.040]   the spread of misinformation. Those who have an audience can ideally set the tone for how
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:43.720]   others decide to assess and amplify what they see online. I'll do the propaganda thing if you want
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:50.920]   me to. I don't know. What do you think of this? This is a story I would not have thought I'd be.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:18:00.040]   I'd be telling you about a year ago. There has been proof that in Europe, actually, that
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:08.360]   influencers were paid to distribute negative messages around
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:18.760]   vaccination, COVID vaccinations. They are, they can, be used for propaganda.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:26.520]   I'm not sure I agree that kids go to TikTok to get all their information. There's a difference
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:34.840]   between learning how to do a dance and making a really tasty cheese toast, then going and figuring
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:41.080]   out the war in Ukraine. Maybe that's just me and my kid. Lev Parnas' 22-year-old son,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:46.920]   Aaron Parnas, is actually one of the Tiktakers who was invited to the talk. You remember Lev Parnas'
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:54.440]   Ukrainian born-in-business man, associate of Rudy Giuliani's, helped Trump pressure Ukraine to
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.880]   investigate Biden and Hider Biden. He was convicted in October on campaign finance charges.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:06.120]   His son says, "I'm not my father. I love him, but I'm not my father." Apparently, he's posting a lot
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:15.320]   of information about nonstop news updates about Ukraine. He is, after all, Ukrainian by ancestry.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.280]   On the night of Russia's invasion, he hosted TikTok live streams discussing the events to
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:28.600]   over 800,000 viewers. That's a much bigger audience than CNN or MSNBC. Every day, he's posted videos
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:36.760]   breaking down news about the war every 45 minutes. Interesting. A Ukrainian born journalist who
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:44.520]   operates the TikTok channel Good Morning Bad News said he thought the overall tone of the briefing
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:49.800]   was too soft and officials dodged hard questions. The energy of the call felt like a press briefing
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:57.800]   for kindergartners. I'm not surprised. I think it's probably smart for the White House to do this.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:08.040]   Yes, you're great. James Allen, who wrote As A Man Thinketh back in the early part of the
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.080]   20th century. There was a passage there. It says, "A person who wants to do well
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:19.800]   shouldn't wrestle with opportunity but must purify the heart. You need to come into these
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.440]   situations, challenging situations, having been fundamentally prepared rather than just
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:32.360]   figuring out at the last minute what to do." If we're coaching TikTok publishers or whatever you
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:38.600]   would call these content developers on TikTok, what our position is, is that really going to be
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:45.080]   effective. I would suggest that that's not nearly as effective as the results one would see from
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:57.000]   a greater focus, a greater love among our citizenry on our collective civic values.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.280]   Now, only heaven knows really how we would agree on what those are, especially in this day and age.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:09.480]   But things like a greater sense of patriotism, not nationalism, but patriotism, a more robust
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:19.480]   sense of our history, a well-fortified sense of what our position in this global conflict is based
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:26.040]   on where we come from as a nation historically in all of these things. Now, I recognize it's a
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.800]   different challenge. I don't want anybody to be hearing what I'm not saying where one has to
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:39.640]   espouse a radical America-first agenda. But the point I'm trying to make is,
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:46.760]   ought there not be more done beforehand before it gets to this point of having to just educate
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:53.560]   the TikTok crowd? In the IRC, there's been some discussion about the importance of educating our
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:22:01.560]   youngsters to recognize logical fallacies and to be able to think well. So it's things like that.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:08.600]   That certainly this briefing is a good thing in principle, as long as it's a good thing in principle,
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.920]   let's hope that it's done well. I think it's a reflection of the reality that
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:18.520]   the gatekeepers are no longer the gatekeepers. I grew up at a time when we had three television
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.280]   networks and every city had maybe two newspapers and there was time and news week and a handful of
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.640]   important national publications. Clearly, we're at a point where one can become a major influencer
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:36.040]   today with, as Leo pointed out, perhaps more viewers in CNN without having gone through any
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.440]   hurdles at all, without having any senior editor having anointed them or hired them,
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.840]   has happened with me in early in my career when I got my first job at the LA Times.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.240]   I mean, so the White House has to grapple with that. They have to come to the realization
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.120]   that you can't just have regular press briefings with accredited reporters. You've got to reach
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.680]   out to these people who collectively may have more influence than the people who are sitting
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:04.920]   in that press room. Taylor Lawrence's article quotes Ellie Zylar, an 18-year-old TikTok star
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:10.760]   with Stand Back 10 and a half million followers. She sees herself as a voice for young people and
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:15.400]   the growing contingent of news consumers getting information through social media platforms.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.800]   I'm here to relay the information in a more digestible manner to my followers. She said,
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:27.080]   "I would consider myself a White House correspondent for Gen Z." At first, I mocked that, but you know
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:31.640]   what? That's exactly what she is. She has more viewers than many White House correspondents do.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.240]   Yeah. Many. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, Carolyn. Go ahead.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:41.080]   I was just going to say, nobody's actually asking the question of why this is happening.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:50.600]   We're going to try and manage creators on social media, but we are not wondering why
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:58.120]   people are turning to our channels together news. Yeah. And we are not doing anything
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   to actually make those news channels because, I mean, obviously, I'm European. I am not just
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:12.360]   European, but I'm Italian. Television in Italy is not one of our best things.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:19.880]   Then I spent 18 years in the UK and, you know, love it or hate it. There is a movie we see.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:26.760]   Everything. You know, I don't think that any channel in the world is not influenced by politics
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:33.080]   in one way or another. Some is more obvious. Some are less. But the way that news are done in
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:38.520]   Europe is really more about the news than not the commentary. And that's what I'm struggling
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:44.200]   in this country. That seems like a lot. And I, you know, there are channels that are not
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.920]   quite too extreme, but there's a lot of opinion that come with the news.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.720]   More and more. That's what gets ratings. Absolutely. And ratings are everything in
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.000]   broadcast mainstream media. So yes, that's strong tendency.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   So I totally agree with Larry about training and what you've been through. But then if that
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.560]   gets thrown out the window because there are other things that play like ratings, like funding,
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:20.360]   like advertising, like everything else, then does your training really matter? Right? If what you're
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:29.800]   saying is change and manipulated by other factors and people are turning to normal humans because they
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:38.440]   think that these people are more truthful or closer to the way that they see things. I don't know.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:43.480]   Some ways that I think my training is counterproductive in the sense that, you know,
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:49.320]   I haven't learned clickbait. I haven't learned how to sensationalize. I've just learned how to
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.400]   tell things away. I think they are. We have to write an article for Larry 10.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.240]   That doesn't get as many viewers. 10 things you need to know before you start writing a blog post.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.040]   You need a number six will blow you away. Well, blow you away. You won't believe that.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:08.600]   We're seven. I'll read that. If 10 things Larry bag it never knew about writing a blog post.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.480]   Exactly. No, you're right. You're real trained for this stuff. I have to say,
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.800]   I would say most of the young people I know get their news and information not from TikTok,
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:25.000]   which is really short form, but from YouTube. But there's a lot of very good. Your kids the same,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.360]   a lot of really strong content on YouTube. If you know the right person to follow,
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:38.520]   not PewDiePie, maybe even not Mr. Beast, but if there are some really quality history and news,
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:45.160]   science channels on YouTube, and I think what I observe is people find the one that they really
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:49.720]   and they're devoted. They very much pay attention to that. Watch it much more than they would watch
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:57.400]   television for sure. There's a handful of publishers on YouTube that I really enjoy because of their
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:04.040]   depth of content. What really draws me to them is that I feel like I'm being told the truth.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.280]   Maybe I'm belaboring the obvious in a way that's not really helpful here.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:17.720]   I suspect that that's something that is attractive to younger folks who are going to TikTok to find
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:25.080]   their information. It's not corporate media. It's just the veneer. It's the removal of the veneer
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.320]   of that corporate media. We are enabled by these technologies and these means of communication
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:36.280]   to have that now more than ever. It's so amazing to think about how different this is than how
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.920]   the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, the first Gulf War going all the way back to Vietnam
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:48.440]   World War II. It's amazing how much more information there is in real time that comes in in high
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:54.680]   resolution. My favorite source of information, and this is just to speaking in the extreme
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.160]   to demonstrate the point here, the information I trust the most is the guy that I know
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:05.320]   just from following him on Instagram over the years because we both like fountain pens.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:16.040]   He's a lawyer in Nipro. That's southeast of Kiev. That's where I want to get information.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.080]   I'm certainly going to trust that more than the most embedded journalist who's going to speak to me
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:26.520]   in the Larry Magad kind of way of not sensationalizing.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.160]   And yeah, Larry and I both come from the older generation, that tradition of journalistic
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.200]   integrity. There's not that understanding of the rules of the road and all that stuff,
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.080]   or even just the who, where, when, why. I think that's on one hand, it's just as you say,
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:49.160]   Evan, that is the beauty of it. It's not that polished stuff. But I also think you don't necessarily know
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:56.280]   as you watch somebody on YouTube, if they have an axe to grind, if they have an interest in this,
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:02.920]   and disclosure is non-existent. I don't know. I'm very torn. I don't want to be the
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.000]   old guy who says, "Oh, you got to do it." Clearly, the forms of journalism are pretty much dead.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.560]   And YouTube is a perfect example of this. And it's also clear that anybody under 25 is getting
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:21.320]   most of their journalism from YouTube, I would think. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:30.760]   Which is not a bad thing, necessarily. It means anybody who has something compelling to say and
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:39.240]   knows how to present it has a voice. But it's also very easy to get, as you've seen,
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:46.600]   sold down the river on that stuff, too. That, again, not to be a dead and very old horse, but I mean,
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:52.200]   I grew up at a time when we had 12 TV channels. The dial literally had 12 options on it.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.400]   I think it went from channel 2 to channel 13, right? And most of them were empty.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   Yeah. Most of them were empty. But I live in LA, so I have to get a lot of stuff.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:03.560]   Oh, okay. But it was really easy. So like, when you're talking about this, I'm thinking to myself,
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.600]   I'd like to know who these great YouTube broadcasters are. Hard to find them. That's right.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.160]   I'm missing out on some of my guests. But you also, they don't have any hierarchy. So the other
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.520]   thing that happened is newspapers, television, there was a hierarchy of editorial people. I mean,
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:23.080]   not always, by the way, a good thing, because at the top of the hierarchy was the guy who owned the
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:28.760]   transmitter, an old white guy. But there were some checks and balances.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:35.400]   But at the same time, 12 channels is not enough to express the broad variety of things in the world.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.760]   I'm not saying I want to go back to those days, but I'm saying I would like personally
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:47.720]   to know who these great YouTube broadcasters are. How can people find, because there's so much
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.640]   crap, if you just go randomly looking on YouTube, you're going to go down all sorts of rabbit holes.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:57.480]   So how can people out in the audience who are listening to us right now, find a collection
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:02.520]   of people who they should be following? Yeah. What does your child do,
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:08.120]   Carolina? Do they have some eye metric that they use, or they just watch whatever?
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:14.600]   Well, I don't know that they have a metric as such, but obviously finding somebody that they can
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:21.640]   relate to either because of interest or because of who they are is absolutely critical. And I think
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:29.640]   that we're going back to that diversity topic that we discussed earlier about the ability of
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:37.160]   seeing somebody that looks like you, that you might think has gone through what you're going through,
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:44.840]   or my CD, what is happening in a similar way that you do because of the experience, not because you
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:49.960]   think alike, but because you had similar experiences. So I know that that matters a lot to them.
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:57.720]   I also know that both that and I keep on telling them to check their sources.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:05.320]   We are not, my husband would like me to police more than I do. I think even if I'm in tech,
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:12.280]   I would kind of be defeated doing that because they are way ahead of me.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.640]   That is sad for somebody who covers tech to admit that.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:25.640]   They're going to just say, "Yeah, mom, right." And so it's just like Larry was saying earlier,
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:32.520]   and what he's doing with his work is giving them the tool to be as smart as they can, right,
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:41.000]   in terms of being able to check their sources, to go and fact-check these people and what they're
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   saying and not just taking it in. And that's true with everything. I mean, that is true as well,
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:55.320]   when you read textbook that are used in school to know who wrote that book, what story are you
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:33:04.280]   being told? Because we know that it's not all the different opinions and different aspects of
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:16.840]   somebody and a character or a fact in history that you're telling because whoever is the point of
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:21.400]   view of whoever wrote that book. And then the teacher who tells you.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:26.760]   It's even true as tech reviews. I mean, there was a time when there was Leo, John Devorak, Walt
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:32.680]   Mossberg, myself, and about a dozen other people who were writing about technology. And you could
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.440]   love us or hate us, agree or disagree, but you kind of knew who we were and who we worked for
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:41.160]   and who was paying us. Now there are thousands and thousands of tech bloggers out there that
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:46.760]   are recommending products day in and day out. And I have no idea who these people are and who's
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:53.080]   paying them and why they're writing about what they're writing. And so, even something as silly
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.200]   is what Smartwatch to buy, it's hard to figure out a credible source. I mean, there are credible
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.720]   sources, but it's hard to know what you happen to be watching is credible.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:10.440]   It was interesting because in the creator world, I think, especially YouTube, the people that do
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:19.880]   great work go to all of, you know, kind of extent to really explain, you know, the posts that are
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:26.760]   sponsored, the posts that are not. And, you know, I did an interview at the end of last year with
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:34.760]   I just seen her sister. And, you know, I looked at, I mean, following I just seen
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:43.400]   just seen for a long time. And I like everything about them. And I wrote the story in the spirit of
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:51.400]   Women History Month. And because it's a story of sisters working together and lifting each other up.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:57.480]   And also a story of a younger generation compared to mine where they didn't think about themselves
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:03.080]   as women in tech or women as a creator in the YouTube world. And they do great work. And we
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:09.080]   were talking about exactly what you're talking about, Larry, about who pays you, you know, how
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:17.000]   can you be as transparent as possible with the content that you put out there so people know.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:25.000]   And it was fascinating because she was saying that now when she's actually asked to showcase a product,
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:33.160]   she will never call that a review because it's not right because they are paid to showcase a product
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:40.280]   versus she's taking a product and she is reviewing all that said, I always remember writing, I was
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:49.640]   still a gardener and I wrote a review of an iPhone and a customer asked who paid for that iPhone.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:56.760]   And I said, man, like, you know, if I was so cheap that, you know, whatever, $800 or whatever,
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:03.400]   would buy me a favorite review? Why would I be? What am I doing a gardener? You know,
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:12.360]   and there are people like that, that just because of a business model might question your ethics.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:20.760]   And I also think that that's not necessarily the right way to go compared to, okay, because you,
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   you know, write for AP, you don't have a point of view or you're not, you know, especially in tech,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:34.600]   we are human. We are, you know, we like some brands better than others and all of that. And I think
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:42.760]   as long as you're transparent, more power to you. Yeah, we threw out though, the notion that any
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:49.000]   of these people in the good old days were independent or, you know, had journalistic ethics. I think
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:55.080]   we've learned that everybody has a point of view. And now it's just a free for all. I mean, you see
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:01.000]   YouTubers who have investments in the not merely given money, but have investments in the companies,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.120]   they're covering. It's, and the FTC has rules, by the way, disclosure.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.320]   And they're on the other side. Even take products, you're supposed to disclose.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.480]   Yeah, I don't know. I think they're probably that's reserved more in the
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:19.720]   breach breach than it is in the reality. But there are supposedly rules now CNN says we're
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:27.400]   going to start streaming CNN plus start streaming in a couple of weeks, $6 a month. Although,
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:34.600]   if you sign up early, you can get it for less. That's interesting, isn't it? I mean, this is
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:41.720]   the old school journalists saying, let us in. I know the streaming changed the equation. I think
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:49.320]   it's still CNN. I think so. Yeah, I think is not the medium is the quality of the content.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.400]   And who's going to show up just because you serve it to make a different way.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.840]   Maybe this is their chance just to free the chains that bind them to cable companies,
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:03.640]   which is not a very good deal. I think a good point. I wonder if you subscribe,
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:10.040]   if you'll also still get the regular CNN with independent of cable in addition to the CNN plus
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.600]   content. I don't know if I want to hear Anderson Cooper talk about parenting, which is what
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:19.160]   if he was show is going to be about. But right now I'm paying Comcast a lot of money to hear the
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:25.160]   likes of Anderson Cooper. Right. And in fact, that's the other thing is a lot of these people,
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.560]   including many of my peers, are moving to YouTube saying, oh, well, we're just going to do the
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:34.200]   YouTube thing. Yeah, and then it basically just another delivery. It's just another delivery
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.560]   meeting. Google instead of Comcast. It's not the same. Yeah. Yeah. Is it? Go ahead, Leo.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.800]   Well, so go ahead. Do you think it's a little different because you're not being paid by a
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:49.160]   company to do it? Well, here's how I'd answer that question and sort of ask if you think that
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:55.640]   I'm thinking about this appropriately. I can't help but go back maybe I think it was maybe 2004
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:00.120]   to the five, 2006 Chris Anderson's book, The Long Tail. Yes. I think that was more of an
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:05.400]   economic thesis where you've got you've got the main providers, the big networks,
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.520]   the fact that always comes to my mind is like, you know, back in the fifties on any given night,
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.480]   whichever night I love Lucy was on like a disproportionate amount or a huge amount of
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:21.720]   his watch. Now we're all sliced up and watching stuff. And so does it is it valid to think of,
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:28.040]   you know, Chris Anderson's model as as rather prescient on how it's come. A lot of this has
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:32.840]   come to pass and there are perhaps issues that weren't good after this show. I'm going to go
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   pull that off of the shelf and thumb through it and revisit it. You know, it's interesting to see
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.280]   and sort of what made me think of this is a big player like CNN and incumbent. I don't know if
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:49.080]   that's the right clinical term or whatever for all of this, but you know, one of those big,
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:57.320]   you know, at the head of The Long Tail, now trying to get into sort of the space where
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:04.120]   the streamers and everybody else is occupying the longer portion of the tail. I would just I'm
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.920]   just sort of setting that out there as a paradigm, wondering how valid that is, how helpful it is
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:13.960]   for us to categorize and categorize. Chris Spook comes from every, you know, that utopian vision
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:19.560]   of the internet we all had some years ago. And it's certainly accurate that The Long Tail
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:24.200]   brings you a much broader variety of content. That's what YouTube is. I've lived in The Long
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.480]   Tail for the last 15 years, and followed from my whole career actually. And that's where you get
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:35.160]   a much broader variety of content. But I don't have the same techno utopian point of view that it's
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.640]   that it's all going to be flowers and daisies from now on, because everybody gets a voice.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.680]   That hasn't really turned out to be accurate either. It goes back to the issues we were talking
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:48.920]   about earlier. Exactly. Who gets the voice? Who has the right to silence? Everybody should have a
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:53.960]   voice. And that's the beauty of The Long Tail. Everybody can't have a voice. But I don't know.
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:41:02.120]   I don't know if it's worked out. So I think there's look, it's this is the way it is. So whether we
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.760]   like it or not, the future of media is much more like YouTube than it is like CNN.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:13.160]   And we're going to have to live with that. And I don't think any attempt to say, oh, you people
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:17.160]   are too stupid to watch all these videos. We really have to watch what we tell you to watch.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.440]   I don't think that's going to work. It's not going to work. But on the other hand,
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:25.480]   the New York Times, the Washington Post, they're doing pretty well right now.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:31.320]   And one of the reasons is I think that millions of people trust the editors who make the decisions
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.280]   as to what they cover. And I think there is still a role for smart editors.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.200]   Yeah, I don't think they'll go away. I think there's a place for them.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:42.840]   It's not going to eliminate the New York Times, but it hasn't limited a lot of local newspapers.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.560]   Local papers in trouble. Yeah. The New York Times success, it is thought by many,
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:53.640]   comes with the fact that they have such a variety of things that it's a multiple subscription. You
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.360]   might like the cooking. You might like the cross words. It's not just about news. And that's how
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:02.760]   the New York Times has managed to make it in a very difficult world for journalism.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.440]   I don't know. I agree with you. I mean, that's why I buy the New York Times and the Washington Post
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.520]   and a bunch of other news sources that I trust. I pay the subscription for them, including something
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.200]   like the information and upstart like the information because I know that that's going to be a good
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:25.160]   source of information. But again, I think if you're under 25, you're not paying, you know,
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.120]   100 bucks a year to get the New York Times. Right. And that's the other problem, right?
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   Is what can you afford versus what is available to you? And it's not a question just,
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:48.120]   should you have to pay for better information, reliable information? And I'm not questioning and
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:54.120]   saying that all newspapers should be free. But I think it's an interesting question. And you've
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:01.320]   seen models like the Guardian in the UK, right, that really struggled to stay independent. And
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:09.640]   they had to ask for funding from the readers and to stay afloat.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:15.640]   It's a really important question. I mean, I would hate to think that only rich people
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:18.520]   can afford good information. That would be a horrible thing.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.640]   Exactly. Very bad. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:25.640]   There's there's a line up. You know who really dominates? You know who dominates honestly and
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.840]   probably will continue to dominate. I'm pulling out my Samsung phone. And if you slide it to the
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:38.040]   right, there's a list of stories that Google picks. That's probably the most important front page
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:45.560]   in in America is that whatever that news page is on your smartphone. That's because who has time to
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.400]   go watch 20 videos and hear a bunch of different points of view, you scan it. It's a scanner.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:55.400]   It's a scanning thing. And the people who choose it are really the aggregators like Google.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:59.480]   I think that's really where power lies at this point.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:05.240]   It's funny because I got a Windows PC, you know, and I just left the defaults.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:10.600]   Microsoft news is terrible. And Microsoft news, it's like clickbait news.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.880]   It's all clickbait. Yeah.
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.960]   And it goes by really quickly and inevitably I'll see a story I'm interested in by the time I want
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.600]   to click on it, it's gone. And then I have to go watch it again.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.400]   Paul bemoans that constantly. Paul Thorett on our Windows Weekly show.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:27.800]   That's, you know, Apple news isn't much better. These platforms have a huge responsibility.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:33.560]   These aggregators are the front page of the internet now. And they have a huge responsibility.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.960]   And they ought to take it more seriously. Now, this is on a Google phone. Most Android phones,
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.200]   you know, you have that kind of Newsy page usually produced by Google.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.880]   In this case, it's by Google. Sometimes it's by Samsung. You don't have something like that on
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:52.440]   the iPhone. So I don't know what people do on the iPhone. Maybe it's Apple news. Do you have a
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:56.360]   news iPhone users? Do you have a news button on your front page that you always go to?
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.760]   How do you do that on the iPhone?
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:04.520]   I don't. I mean, Twitter is my morning job news.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.680]   There you go. Twitter. Yeah. For a lot of tech journalists,
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:15.160]   tech people, Twitter is the front page. Yeah. Huge responsibility. Actually, that's why Twitter
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:22.360]   blue has that top articles section now. Yeah, which is suggesting we, we, I'm not suggesting
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:25.960]   we talk about this because it's going to go on the thing. But I find it interesting, Leo, you
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:33.160]   talk about this responsibility. And Carolina, you were talking about the responsibility
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.760]   before, as if it's a, you know, a foregone conclusion that these platforms have
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:43.000]   a responsibility. I think it's edifying for us to all for at the appropriate time to consider,
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.680]   you know, what is the origin in the nature of that responsibility? And you know, on what standards
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:58.520]   is the quality of the fulfillment of that responsibility judged? Yeah. I don't think the answers are easy.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.680]   They carry more. These guys carry more weight than the New York Times editorial board ever did.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.280]   They are choosing the front page. What stories do you like broadcast? I mean,
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.960]   back back to Evan's question, I mean, broadcast an FCC license meant that you had to present the
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:21.080]   news, right? If you were CBS, ABC, NBC, you were obligated by government, being for that free airwaves
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.320]   to do think to be responsible. And that's what with a generate, that's what generated the Walter
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.720]   Cronkite through the world. But Google, it doesn't have to do that. Facebook, Apple doesn't have,
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.280]   there's nobody telling them what they have to do. It's an exact there are laws,
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:38.840]   there are and there are laws protecting them. I'm going back to section 230. I'm a lawyer.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.120]   Yeah. Everything looks like a hammer. Everything looks like a nail because I'm a hammer.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:48.360]   You know, there are laws that that actually protect the ability to be quite selective in that
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:53.880]   some in in a certain sense, very different than the nature of the broadcast rules of
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.360]   well, the traditions of broadcast has changed when news became a profit center, you know,
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.840]   at some point, because what I'm talking about is going back into the 60s and 70s, but you're
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.440]   actually right. Yeah.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:10.920]   Should mention, by the way, as long as we're talking about journalism that Brent Renau, who was a
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:20.440]   filmmaker and journalist, Neiman award winner, was shot by Russian troops at a checkpoint in
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:28.600]   Ukraine today and died. So there are still people who care a lot about journalism,
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   who put their life on the line to bring us information and news that we can act as citizens
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:41.080]   of the world. So we can act responsibly. And those people are putting their lives on the line.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:46.920]   They're really, really risking everything. So it's important. This stuff is very, very
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:53.560]   important. And we do need this information to be to be able to operate in the world. It's not just,
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:58.520]   it's not just entertainment. Unfortunately, it looks a lot like entertainment if you watch
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:06.280]   television news, but it isn't. This information is stuff we need so that we can be better citizens.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.800]   And think about the diet that the Russians are getting what they're getting right now is if
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:15.080]   they're just watching television, if they don't media and how we don't want to go down that path.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.880]   That's right. How much we are in these independent journalists.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:25.000]   That's right. Let's take a little break. Sorry to be the bear of those sad tidings. But
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:34.440]   it underscores how important this job is. And it's maybe it shouldn't be left in the hands of
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:42.600]   Kukul or Apple or Microsoft or Twitter. But I don't know what another way to do this. I mean,
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.080]   clearly it wasn't much better to say, Oh, the New York Times is the journal record.
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:51.800]   They're the only people who matter. That wasn't it either. I'm balanced. You think we're better off
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:57.320]   the way it is now with a thousand different sources. And it's up to the individual to kind of
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:02.120]   sift through them and make some sense of it. Carolina, are we better off with the new situation
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:02.840]   the way it is today?
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:12.520]   You ask me which kind of death I want to die, to be honest. It's not perfect either way.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:20.760]   I guess. No, it isn't really. But I really strongly believe that one voice is not the way.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.120]   Yeah. I think we are better off now. I really do. Do you agree, Larry?
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:35.320]   I would if we could get a diet of accurate information. I think we're better off by having
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:42.040]   multiple opinions and multiple angles and multiple views. But I'm very upset about the fact that
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:47.880]   some people are getting false information or being lied to. And that's what's really bothering me.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.520]   And that's always been true. But they were marginalized and now they're getting it millions
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:59.080]   and millions of people are getting that. So I'm not going to give it. I don't think it's an A or B.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:02.920]   I mean, I don't want to go back to the old days. But I want to go to a point where people are
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.840]   getting accurate information, whatever that takes.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:09.560]   Well, I think what Carolina and her husband are doing with their kid is the right thing to do,
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:13.960]   which is say, consider the source, consider the source, try to find other sources,
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:20.120]   try to really vet it. The good news is I think their generation, your kid's generation
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:26.200]   doesn't have that sense that my generation had it as well. It was in the times it must be true.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.760]   At least, which it wasn't. It wasn't always true. It wasn't always true.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:36.520]   So maybe there's something to be said for that. Evan, you think we're better off with the news
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.600]   environment we have today? I don't have any business answering that question with all the
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:46.600]   skilled journalists in this conversation. But what I would say speaking from my domain of thought is,
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:55.080]   I love the principles that are embodied in the First Amendment. And the challenge is making sure
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:03.960]   that those are done well. Free speech, the freedom of the press, the free establishment clause, when
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:09.480]   it comes to how people express their spiritual lives, the right to peaceably assemble. I mean,
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:16.440]   that is the gasoline that powers the engine of democracy. And I don't know if I made that.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:21.880]   I'm sure other people have said that. I'm not trying to be more dramatic about it than it's
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:29.320]   necessary. But I mean, without those principles, we don't have much of a hope for peace and
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:34.280]   prosperity and all those things, clearly the challenge is just having it done well.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:43.000]   I agree with you. Have faith in the principles and act as best you can in that light. And yes,
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.200]   there will be problems. There is no perfect solution. But if your belief is in the free flow of
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:55.880]   information, the First Amendment, I think that's going to get us a lot farther than anything else is.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:03.080]   So maybe that's why I like the situation as it is today. Yes, there's problems. But at least,
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:09.400]   if you want to know something, you can find out. And if you have something to say, you can say it.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:16.280]   Larry, you and I grew up in an era where you had to go bang on doors and get somebody to let you
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.960]   say it. You make a phone. Get permission, right? I remember trying to get my first job in radio
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:28.120]   and just going, you know, pound in the pavement for months. But now you can just do a podcast or
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:32.680]   start a blog. I remember when I started my my start on my website, which obviously doesn't have
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:36.760]   the gazillions of viewers. I remember saying to somebody for the first time in my life, I'm a
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:42.760]   publisher. I'm not a writer, publisher. I own the printing press. I think the long run. That's
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:49.560]   the right way. That's the way it should be in the long run. Yeah. Let's take a little break. Our
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:55.560]   show today brought to you by better help. We couldn't be a better time for better help. Better help
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:00.840]   is online therapy that helps you take care of your most important relationship, the one you have
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:08.760]   with yourself better help. You deserve to be happy. You know, maybe you're one of those people who
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:13.800]   drop anything to go help somebody you care about. We go out of our way to treat other people well.
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.880]   You know, you try to be a nice person, but are you doing the same for you? That's okay.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:24.440]   It's okay to do that. Don't feel bad about that, whether it's hitting the gym or just,
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:30.200]   you know, making time for a massage or even trying psychotherapy. You're your greatest asset,
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:37.640]   invest the time and effort into yourself, just like you do for other people. Therapy is,
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:44.120]   it should not be a stigma. It is just looking to the resources that are out there to help you
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:49.800]   live a better life, whether it's a better relationship with your loved ones, whether it's a better
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:57.800]   relationship with the world, better focus, help you with anxiety, better help can really help.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:04.440]   It's online therapy that offers video, phone or even live chat sessions with your therapist.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:08.840]   I think the reason they offer those variety of modalities is because sometimes you don't want
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.440]   to see somebody you want to or don't even want to talk to somebody. You want to type to somebody.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.880]   Whatever you communicate your way, and that's the beauty of this, plus it's much more affordable
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:23.240]   than in-person therapy. And because it's global, you don't have to use the therapist down the street.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:28.040]   You know, there's a lot of reasons why you might want the privacy of using a therapist in another
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:35.960]   city or even another state. Plus, there are all kinds of modalities out there, all kinds of therapy,
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:41.400]   and at better help, you can find a therapist that works the way you want to work. You can be
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:45.400]   matched to the therapist under 48 hours. I want to be clear, this is not crisis help.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:51.720]   There are, you know, call a crisis line if you're having a current crisis. But if you're looking at
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:58.600]   long-term psychotherapy, just to help you have a better life, this is a great way to do it. No matter
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:05.240]   where you are, no matter where you are in your life, it is amazing. Give it a try. See why over
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:09.160]   2 million people have used better help online therapy. As we've been doing these ads, I've heard
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.520]   more and more stories from family members, listeners who say, "You know what? This was great. I'm so
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:20.440]   glad I did this." You can message any time with your therapist, which is really nice.
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:25.640]   It makes it very easy to schedule. And you're not limited as to the therapist in your neck of
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:31.080]   the woods. Yes, they have group sessions even. I think group sometimes is really valuable to see
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:37.400]   other people experiencing the same issues you are. Betterhelp.com/twit. Find out more.

[01:55:55.400 --> 01:56:03.240]   I think this is really now is the time. We need it. Betterhelp.com/twit.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.280]   Couldn't recommend it more highly. It's very, very important.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:18.040]   All right. Let's move on. Maybe I could find something a little more fun.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:25.320]   No. No. Although I have to say, I'm very interested with Amazon's doing. Clubhouse was all the rage.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:31.000]   Remember a couple of months ago, maybe a year ago? Yeah. And this kind of faded. Amazon has
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.720]   decided to do a clubhouse competitor, but I think they're going to do it better. They call it AMP.
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:44.760]   It is now opening up. You still have to get an invite. But the idea is you can play music. They
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.240]   have deals with all the record labels. You have tens of millions of licensed songs.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:56.120]   So you could be a DJ if you want. You could take phone calls if you want. And it all works
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:01.400]   through an app iOS right now, only in the US, but they plan to expand it to Android and rest of the
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:07.720]   world. You can download AMP from the App Store, sign up to get on the wait list. I think this is
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:14.440]   very interesting. I'm sort of focused on this because this is the space I work in. And I look
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:21.800]   at Spotify is trying to own this space and Apple and Facebook. And now here's Amazon. They have a
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:27.480]   very interesting play on this. Amazon. I wonder why they didn't call it a radio because it is,
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:34.200]   isn't it? It's radio on the internet. Amazing concept. What's funny is the rules which seem
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:39.000]   complicated are exactly the same rules you have on the radio. So they obviously have the same kind
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000]   of licensing deals with the record labels. You could play two songs from the same album or three
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000]   songs in the same artist and any three hour window. You can't repeat songs in that time frame.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.000]   These are I just went through these rules and broadcast. We have to do these classes every
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.640]   every year to make sure we're adhering to the rules. And that's exactly the same deal that the
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:02.680]   record labels have the the broadcaster. So it is really kind of like radio. You can't
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:08.120]   focus on taking song requests. You can't play any songs from outside the library unless you have
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:16.680]   the right to do so. It's audio. I feel like this is going to be a very strong contender and a lot
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:24.040]   more interesting, frankly, than clubhouse. I grew up a time when DJs were really important.
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:28.360]   Right. Every major city had its DJ and just about every teenager
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:34.040]   with an amored with that DJ. And if we could get back to that point, that would be kind of exciting.
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:41.320]   Why not do it on the app? I think it's a great idea. I'd love to see a resurgence of great DJ.
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:48.120]   And I don't mean DJs like in the concert. I mean people actually talk and get put together segues,
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:54.280]   put together lists of songs that relate. Yeah, get some news in there.
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:58.680]   You and I could get a job if you do the five minute news on some of these radio.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:03.240]   You don't even get see Larry, you're still in the old school way of thinking you don't need a job
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:07.960]   anymore. You just do this. That's true. You don't need a bond. You don't even need money anymore.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:13.000]   No, not even any money anymore. Just need a phone. It's pretty. I mean, I think it's a I think in
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.800]   the long run, this is all very good. You know that anybody who wants to do this cam, my son has
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:23.560]   become a TikTok star. He doesn't it's I like it because he doesn't use the report name. So it's not
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:30.920]   you know, he's not playing. You're proud but at a distance. No, I just don't. He's making it on his
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:37.400]   own. He's salt. Hank, you go to salthank.com and he does these TikTok cooking videos. He sells salt,
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:43.240]   by the way, I'll give him a little plug. The new salts are in just added chimichurri.
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:48.280]   Truffle garlic's my favorite and they just got a whole bunch of more in stock.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:52.200]   So if you're in the mood for salt, but this is a perfect example. Here's a kid group.
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:59.160]   He's 27 now. He grew up watching YouTube cooking videos. Said, that's what I want to do. I said,
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:05.720]   because I'm an old guy, son, get a real job. Right. Listen to me and Larry Magget. Get a real job,
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:10.520]   son. And he said, no, I want to do these cooking videos. And he started doing them on TikTok.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:17.240]   And now he's got almost two million followers on TikTok. And he's got a sponsor who's
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:23.720]   clothing sponsor who's I think pretty much guaranteeing him a salary for the next year.
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:30.840]   It's kind of amazing. Okay, Leo, I demand equal time. My son, willmagget.com. Yes.
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:36.440]   Also, Balkan Bump, which is the name he plays under. I told him to get his master's degree so
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:40.680]   he could teach music. And he said, Dad, I want to go out and perform. And of course, that was a
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:46.520]   crazy idea. Well, two Super Bowl players later and a successful concert career. Wait a minute.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:52.200]   He's got a he's been on a Super Bowl commercial. Two of them. He knew that he's been licensed by
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:57.640]   Porsche for their electric car commercial. Oh, so they're a row. And he's always on tour.
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.920]   Also not using the Oh, yeah, he's using the Megan name. Well, he's the
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.840]   Megan, but he actually performs a lot under the name Balkan Bump, which I also thought was a
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:09.400]   crazy idea. Why would you create another brand? Oh, I thought salt Hank was insane. Yeah, you know,
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:15.240]   and I argued with him, but just I was on a plane from Frankfurt to Paris. And I was telling this guy
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:19.880]   from LA about my son, because he performed me. And he'd never heard of him. And then I said,
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:23.720]   Oh, yeah, he plays into the name Balkan Bump. He says, you're kidding. Your son is Balkan Bump.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:27.640]   I get that too. It wasn't my last thing.
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:34.840]   So he plays the trumpet. Yeah, he does. And he's also a DJ and, you know,
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:39.080]   and his world. It's world music. He's obviously influenced by world music. Yeah, he's
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:45.400]   traced study, ethnomusicology. And he does a lot of world music. He started out in Western Africa,
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:50.040]   but now he's going doing a lot around the Balkans. And you know, the only problem is I can't even
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.120]   get him to perform at my party. He's too busy. I don't know if I can afford him. He'll be performing
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:02:00.440]   at the Nectar Lounge in Seattle, Washington on Friday, Eugene, Oregon at the Big Dirty Saturday,
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:05.240]   following Friday, Santa Barbara at the Lucidity Festival. Always playing the Fox.
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:10.600]   He had a little. And Fox. That's a huge one. Yeah. That's a wow. Look at this guy.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:16.200]   Do you have a Midwest tour coming up? He just he did Chicago recently. Yeah, he's always doing
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:22.040]   travel. You know, it's hysterical is if you said to a kid 10 years ago, you should play the trumpet.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:27.640]   That's going to be the next big thing. All right. He would have laughed. But that's what I like about
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:34.200]   our kids. And Caroline is too. They're themselves. And that's I think a little bit different. I think
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:40.920]   you don't have the, you know, the days of all you go to college, you get a degree, you get recruited
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:45.880]   by DuPont. You'll work there 50 years, you get the gold watch you're retired. Those days are long
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:50.840]   gone. Long gone. Thank goodness. Don't say that because we're still convincing them that they
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.880]   should go to college. But we might. Are they are they in high school now? Or are they college
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:03.960]   age or? They're 14. So very young still. Yeah, to high school. I'm hoping to be honest with you by
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:11.080]   the time they're out of a high school that college will not matter in the same way as it has in the
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:18.920]   past. Right. So that you've seen in tech people understanding that maybe they need to use other
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:25.080]   criteria to choose who's a good candidate and who isn't right and looking more at skills and
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:31.720]   ability versus what you get out of a test score. I think it's good to go to college. If you don't
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:39.720]   get in crushing debt as a result. Absolutely. That's exactly it. And it's not just certain
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.840]   colleges that open door, but it's really. It's opening your mind more than opening the doors.
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:48.360]   And it's not just you learning about the world around you. And if that's what you're learning,
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.600]   a lot of my friends, collaborators are people who met in college. That's how he got his start
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:58.600]   in professional music with by collaborating with fellow students and faculty and others. And
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:04.120]   when I think back to my days at Berkeley, you know, gavillion years ago, it wasn't what I learned,
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:07.880]   but who I hung out with that had such a huge impact on my life. I think that's true. Yeah.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:15.560]   Yeah, it's a social experience. So we're all in favor of going to college. Don't think we're not.
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:16.280]   She for Caroline.
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:22.360]   It's funny. I will call you up and you'll help me with that.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:28.440]   I'm watching the dropout, which is Elizabeth Holmes Theranos story. Great show. She drops out of
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:33.640]   Stanford sophomore year because she's going to make this thing that will never work. And they said,
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:36.440]   why do you drop it out of college? Parents, probably. What are you dropping out of college?
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:40.840]   She said Bill Gates dropped out of college. Steve Jobs dropped out of college. Larry Elza
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.560]   dropped out of college. Leo LaPorte dropped. No, she did not say that, but she could have.
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:53.080]   Probably doesn't matter as much as it used to. But on the other hand, I think that's from the
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:58.520]   outside world. But from the inside, the stuff you experience is you have the things you learn.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.240]   And you'll never be a lawyer like Evan if you don't go to college, right? You got to go to college
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:04.200]   for that. That's right.
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:14.200]   Biden signs an executive order that the crypto community is saying is very good for crypto.
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:26.440]   He's saying that government agencies need to kind of pay attention to this. It emphasizes the
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:31.000]   government's commitment to ensuring that virtual assets are developed responsibly.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.200]   And ensuring responsible development of digital assets, that's even in the title,
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:43.880]   and talks about developing a digital dollar, which is kind of interesting. I think the crypto
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:50.200]   community is both happy and upset about this. On the one hand, a lot of people in the crypto
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:53.640]   community say no government with the whole point of this is no government involvement.
[02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:58.520]   On the other hand, I think there's so much uncertainty. Is it taxable? Is it an asset?
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:03.800]   Is it security? That they just want some feedback from government about what it is.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:11.800]   And I think the notion of a digital dollar is intriguing to some, not probably the Bitcoin
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:19.000]   brows, but intriguing to some. Is it PayPal or digital dollar? I mean, what is a digital dollar?
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.640]   Your master card is a digital dollar. Yeah, master card.
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.080]   One's a lot. Honestly, these days is rare that we handle currency.
[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:33.160]   Right. Apple cash. Yeah, that's digital. I write maybe two checks a year at that, if that
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:38.120]   I never write checks. Well, I found out in Georgia,
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:44.440]   a lot of people write checks still and one checks. I'm always going to, oh, yes.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:50.920]   Interesting. The whole house experience has been interesting. And the amount of fees, actually,
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:58.040]   that you are charged if you're using digital payments. And it's not just Amex.
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:06.280]   It's any credit card has a fee associated with it. It is quite fascinating. But all that said,
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:11.480]   I also got an email on, I think it was Friday or yesterday from rooms to go,
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:17.560]   who now will accept crypto payments. And I was like, that's what I wanted to do in life,
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:22.920]   go and buy a new sofa and use crypto and use a cryptocurrency that you don't know what it's
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:29.080]   worth tomorrow. Could go up, could go down. It's risky. I have my sofa. Yeah. Did you actually buy
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:35.960]   a sofa using crypto? No, no. For a little while, you have the option.
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:39.320]   They took that away. Yeah. Tesla decided not to do that. You know, it's really,
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:44.040]   we're, you know, this, what this show is all about is the brave new world that we're living in. It is,
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:50.600]   it's remarkable. Moderna, which developed, of course, one of the two most popular
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:58.520]   mRNA vaccines against COVID has said mRNA is the future messenger RNA. We're going to develop
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:04.840]   mRNA vaccines for 15 of the world's worst diseases. They're already working on HIV.
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:12.280]   In fact, I think they're already in trials on an HIV vaccine. They also want to develop
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:20.440]   vaccines against, I hope I'm not pronouncing this wrong, Chikung Guoña. I'm not familiar with that.
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:26.040]   Dengue, I know, Ebola, malaria, a max, a malaria vaccine to be huge.
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:32.920]   Mideast respiratory syndrome. And this is really a technology story because mRNA vaccines
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.320]   were developed. I mean, they've been working on them for more than a decade, scientists have,
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:45.400]   but the vaccine for COVID was developed after sequencing the COVID gene in a weekend and then
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:53.000]   developing a vaccine computationally from it. Testing is what took a long time, almost a year.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:01.240]   So the technology, though, is, is now, you know, much better understood. Scientists at the University
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:06.120]   of Pennsylvania were able to create mRNA that could get past the cells' defenses without triggering
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:11.720]   an immune response, but still recognized by the ribosome. In the case of COVID vaccines,
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:17.320]   the modified RNA was programmed to get the ribosome to make the spike protein. And then your immune
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:25.560]   system was awakened and trained and responded. So it's a very, it's kind of a Trojan horse delivery
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:31.480]   vehicle to get past the cells' defenses and then say, "Hey, you ought to know here it comes."
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:39.240]   And you better be prepared. It's also, as another benefit, unlike many vaccines,
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.760]   it's easy to scale in production at a relatively low cost. It doesn't require chicken eggs,
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:53.160]   things like that. I mean, Leo, we certainly can't look past the polarizing nature of vaccination.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:58.280]   So not only is this a technology story, but it's sort of an information, you know, and
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:01.080]   misinformation story. Well, I'm sure people are hearing this.
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:05.240]   And, you know, and I know some people were hearing this going, "Oh, no, Bill Gates is not putting
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:12.760]   us needle in my arm." Yeah. My Moderna is building a half billion dollar facility for manufacturing
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:19.640]   mRNA vaccines in Kenya so that it could supply up to half a billion doses a year of those vaccines
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:25.400]   to the African continent. I think it could change the world. It could change global health.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:30.760]   It's interesting, you know, for every anti-vaxxer, there are so many people who are just can't wait
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.840]   I mean, when you're reading this story, I'm so excited. I was hoping you would
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.240]   mention some diseases that I'm worried about getting. But the point is,
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:45.000]   there is a lot of research about cancer because, you know, the big problem with our current
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.560]   cancer treatments is they kill everything around the cancer, whether it's radiation or chemo,
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:56.600]   they're very, they're poisonous. They're very deadly. And a targeted vaccine targeted to the genome of
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:03.000]   the specific cancer organism, you know, you've got, it could potentially transform how we treat
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.160]   cancer. So all of that is on the horizon. I think it's very, very interesting.
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:17.320]   And you know what? Darwin will win in the long run. Exactly. If you're against it, that's fine.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:21.560]   Don't get the vaccine. Yeah, the only reason I actually have any problem with it is when you're
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.800]   talking about a communicable disease. Well, that's right. It's not just you.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:30.040]   My house. Yeah. But if it's cancer, and as far as we know, cancer isn't contagious,
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:36.520]   take it, don't take it. You know, that's your problem. Yeah. But when it came to the larger issue,
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:43.160]   I mean, you know, we can't be dismissive. This again, there's a theme here of the variety of
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:49.720]   viewpoints here. I mean, one may think that it's, you know, baffling why this is a polarizing issue,
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:56.680]   you know, and one may see very clearly. But you know, if we don't want to have a continuation of the
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:03.160]   trench warfare of information that's been going on the last couple of years, we've got to find
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:09.080]   more meaningful ways to make information. Well, it happens in a lot of realms. I mean,
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:14.440]   there are those who think GMOs are hazardous and want to stop at cold. And there are those
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:20.440]   who see GMOs as the future of food delivery in the world. I mean, it's, I think
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:27.960]   though, in the long run, these discussions are fine and appropriate. But in the long run, I think
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:35.240]   the benefits outweigh the negatives. But we'll see. Oh, yeah. And there are facts, right? There's
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:44.280]   science with science data. Yeah. Absolutely. Ford is going to ship and sell vehicles that are
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:49.880]   missing chips. Apparently GM's been doing this too. We had the story a couple of weeks ago that
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:53.720]   GM was going to start selling trucks without seat warmers because they couldn't get the chips to
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:13:00.040]   control the seat warmers. Ford is going to start doing this to vehicles without rear heating or
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:05.560]   air conditioning controls. And then when the semiconductors become more available, the dealer
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.560]   will get them and you'll have to go in and get them installed. So they're actually building these
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:15.640]   vehicles with like us, you know, a socket waiting for the rest of the parts.
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:25.880]   I have to say I read the title and I was like, what? Maybe it wouldn't help if it's non critical.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:30.680]   Not critical. But that's what's so interesting. The chip shortage warmer. Yeah, it's not just,
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:37.560]   you know, it's not just the flagship CPUs or GPUs. The chip shortage affects really and maybe
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.360]   even worse, these little legacy nodes, these small factories that are, you know, they entirely
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:51.560]   responsible for the seat warming semiconductor. Wireless charging, HD radios, a fuel management
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:58.200]   module, Tesla sold some cars without USB ports, but made them installable. Yeah, the later date.
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:04.600]   Cadillac. That's why Apple was able to have more on the Mac. That's right. Thank goodness, right? No,
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:10.280]   you're not. You're kidding, but it's true. Apple with its huge buying power went to TSMC and bought
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:14.680]   up all the capacity. So you're not, you're not actually, I mean, I don't know if you're wrong
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:20.200]   specifically. I don't think we can blame Apple for no USB ports in Tesla. But but but certainly
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:27.400]   Apple because of its clout was able to buy up all the chip production. BMW began shipping some cars
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.280]   without touch screens. Cadillac. Really? Wow. Yeah. Cadillac nixed its hand free driving.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:38.360]   Do you drive a car without a touch screen? Is that possible? Use knobs like like an like an
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:46.760]   animal. You get that dials buttons. All right, let me take one more break. Then we can get a few
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:53.880]   more stories in and wrap it up. I have I have I am a fan of this panel. Carolina Milanese,
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:59.160]   he's so nice to have you here. What's for dinner tonight? Just curious I might come over.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:04.920]   Well, given that we're finishing at eight 30, I'm afraid the kid is on the wrong.
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:12.280]   Oh, no, I don't know what hamburgers hamburgers. That's it. I know. It's great to have you.
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:17.080]   Of course, Larry Maggud, my old friend, connect safely.org at Larry Maggud on Twitter.
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:22.680]   And a longtime friend of the network former cohost of this weekend law, Evan Brown from
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:30.040]   evan.law. Good to have all three of you are showed. They brought to you by Mint Mobile. I hear so many
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.640]   horror stories about people who are who have cell phone service with the big three.
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:41.480]   And I just want to say, just get Mint Mobile. Get Mint Mobile. What's your what's your cell
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:47.560]   bill? Seriously with Verizon or AT&T or Sprint. You know, it's 80, 90, 90 bucks, 100 bucks.
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:53.960]   If saving more and spending less is one of your top goals for 2022, don't delay. You should switch
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:58.360]   to Mint Mobile. It's the easiest way to save this year. They're the first companies they'll
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:03.240]   premium wireless service online only. Don't look for a Mint Mobile store. There isn't one.
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:12.120]   Just just go to mintmobile.com/twit and maximize your savings. Plans and Mint Mobile start at $15
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:17.080]   a month. Oh, Leo, what could you get for $15 a month? Well, you could get unlimited talk,
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:24.520]   unlimited text nationwide, and high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.080]   15 bucks a month. Why pay for data you're not going to use. I think that's a
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:35.240]   two gig plan. You can get more, but it's always a lot less. By going online only and eliminating
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:40.280]   the traditional cost of retail, Mint Mobile passes significant savings on to you. And they don't
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:45.400]   nickel and dime you with hidden fees. You can even get the SIM for free. They'll send you a SIM,
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:50.840]   put it in your existing phone. If you want, port your phone number over, all your contacts go with it.
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:55.000]   It's just the right way to go. With Mint Mobile, you choose the amount of monthly data that's
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.320]   right for you and you stop paying for data you never use. If you want, they do have an unlimited plan.
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:05.960]   It's like, why are we paying more? Switch to Mint Mobile, get premium wireless service,
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:11.800]   starting at $15 a month. And they're running on the T-Mobile network. And I have to say, by the way,
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:19.080]   the T-Mobile Ultra Capacity 5G that we get now here in Petaluma, and I think around most of the country,
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:29.080]   I saw 500 megabits down, 30 megabits up. I've changed my tune on 5G. So get a 5G phone,
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:37.560]   get the deal, you get the 5G with Mint Mobile, mintmobile.com/twit. Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:42.840]   Not everybody's got Ryan Reynolds as a spokesperson and owner. Get your new wireless plan for just
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:51.720]   $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your door for free, mintmobile.com/twit. $15 a month.
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.280]   Roberto says, I have the unlimited plan on my iPhone 13 Pro Max. You like it, Roberto.
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:02.440]   He's in New York. Works well for you, right? It's a great solution. Thank you, Mint Mobile. Thank you.
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:11.240]   We had a great week on the network this week, so much so that I've commissioned
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:15.000]   the editors to prepare this short film for you. Enjoy.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.720]   I'm Jason Howell. It's also your weekly source for the latest people in real life sitting next to
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:25.400]   me. Like me. It's on Ron Richards and I'm here in the studio. And I don't get to be in the studio,
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:30.280]   but I'm still here. There's a space at the table for you. Some day we'll figure that. We'll coordinate
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:35.160]   that. We looked up before the show started. The last time I was here was December 2018.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:42.920]   Previously on Twit. Twit News. They have been glowing out of the park, I think. Very impressive
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:49.880]   pricing, I think. Competitive. But more interesting, they found a way to take the existing M1s
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:56.600]   and make them even more pro with the M1 Ultra. I think what they offered was their replacement
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:03.320]   for the iMac Pro. Floss Weekly. This week, Jonathan Bennett and I talked to Matt Mullin-Wigg,
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:11.080]   the co-founder and alpha dude at WordPress, which is what he calls on the show,
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:18.520]   "The Dark Matter of the Web Security Now." Russian authorities are drafting a set of measures
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:25.560]   to support the country's economy against the pressure of foreign sanctions. And as part of this,
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:33.320]   the proposal would eliminate intellectual property right limitations in order to explicitly permit
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:42.760]   piracy within Russia. Twit. It's where your brain and tech meet. In a collision of spectacular
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:50.920]   proportion, the sad story of the week, Facebook's parent company will make employees do their own
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:20:00.360]   laundry. All the big tech companies are making employees come back next week or month.
[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:06.600]   Meta told workers on Friday, "We'll reduce or eliminate some of its famous perks,"
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:11.640]   as it brings people back to the office's story in the New York Times about Mike Isaac. I love it.
[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:19.640]   They also did some sneaky things. Cutting back or eliminating free services like laundry and dry
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:26.280]   cleaning, "Okay, fine. We don't do our employees laundry either." They're pushing, they had a free
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:32.200]   dinner, free meal. It used to be at 6 p.m. It's now 6.30. Now you might say, "Well, what's the big
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:37.080]   deal about that?" Well, the last shuttle home leaves at 6. Ah, tricky.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:44.440]   So apparently... You only cook your own dinner. Yeah, apparently what workers were doing is they
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:50.760]   were running over making giant to-go boxes and getting on the bus and going home. We won't be able
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:21:00.120]   to do that anymore. Come on, Meta. We're laughing about this, but you can't have your cake and eat it
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:07.720]   too and ask people to come back. For a lot of employees, especially Gen Ziers and Milenio,
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:14.920]   going back to campus means going back to some of the perks that make a difference when those perks
[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:21.880]   were part of the reason why maybe your salary wasn't as high as somebody else's.
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:29.880]   Now you're taking stuff away and you're asking me to come in and commute and have longer days or
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:36.920]   have higher costs if I'm driving my own car or whatever a case might be. Something's got to give.
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:41.960]   I agree. It's hard to get people to come back to work. Facebook says they want everybody coming
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:47.000]   back March 28th. But to say at the same time, but don't worry, you're not going to get any food
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:56.040]   or dry cleaning. The great resignation is not over. No. And especially in the tech industry,
[02:21:56.040 --> 02:22:02.040]   it's very fluid. I mean, would you quit a job because there were fewer beans in the bean bag? I
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:11.080]   don't know. But it seems like a bad time to do something like that. Yeah. I think so. I saw and
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:18.280]   I can't remember who it was. But it was a battalion manager from a tech company who said on Twitter
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:25.720]   that every time they see a company saying that they're forcing people back, their head answers
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:32.520]   are hitting up those employees. Yeah. Because he knows that forcing people back right now is not
[02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:40.920]   is not the thing to do. Mike Isaacs final line in this article, one company, I'm sorry, one employee
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:46.760]   when reached for comment on the changes texted, I can't talk. I'm doing my laundry.
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:59.080]   By the way, Mike, congratulations. His book Superpumped is now an HBO series on Travis Kalenick.
[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:06.360]   And have any of you watched Superpumped yet? No. No. Because we, you know, I'm curious because,
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:12.120]   I mean, we covered the story as it was happening. And but so it's kind of interesting to see,
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:16.840]   I think it's well done. That and dropout show that there's a lot of interest in how Silicon
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:25.160]   Valley works. And the cutthroat kind of culture of Silicon Valley is very much highlighted in these.
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:39.880]   Twitter is looking for younger users. So they've hired a, a, a, a, a, a, the world's, the tech world's
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:45.240]   teen, Savant, Jess, Josh Robinson. He's an 18 year old freshman at the University of Connecticut.
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:52.840]   And I'm sorry, that's not how they hired. That's the, that's the lead in the article. They hired
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:58.520]   Michael Salmon. He's a prodigy in Silicon Valley when it comes to building products for young people.
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:03.560]   He dropped out of high school at age 17 recruited by Mark Zuckerberg to work for Facebook.
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:08.840]   At Facebook, he helped the platform build out and launch products like the Snapchat killer
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:18.920]   Instagram stories. He left Facebook at 2017. He worked there on YouTube shorts, which basically was
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:25.320]   YouTube's attempted TikTok killer. I don't think it succeeded yet. Then he went to Roblox
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:31.480]   in 2020 to help the gaming platform incorporate more social functionality. Sounds like he is the
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:38.600]   Wunderkind. He will be working on at Twitter, something called zero one, a new group focused
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.880]   on building experimental features within the company. Can you get young people to use Twitter?
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:50.520]   Probably not. Only if you can have the reverse chronological timeline. Oh, yeah. Thank you for
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:56.360]   turning that off. It's still in there, but Twitter has made it harder to, I mean, look,
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:03.560]   that's how I want to see Twitter, right? Yeah. In fact, I hate it. I'll open Twitter and I get
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:10.600]   something for three days ago. Yeah, that's not what I want to see. So the design change, which
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:16.040]   lets you swipe between your home, which is the algorithmic non chronological timeline.
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:21.800]   And the latest, which is the chronological timeline was announced Thursday to set it up.
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:24.840]   You tap. I'll have to try this. Tap the sparkle icon.
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:32.440]   I guess it's better than the hamburger menu. You tap the sparkle icon in the top right corner,
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:37.640]   the option to pin your latest timeline. If you select that, you'll see both home and latest tabs
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:43.320]   at the top of the iOS app. If you use pin lists on the iOS app, that layout should look familiar.
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:47.240]   The feature is available right now in iOS coming soon to Android and the web.
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:56.280]   So that sounds like it's easier. Or no, it's harder. Because, okay, so this is why it's harder
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:01.240]   according to J. Peter's writing for the Verge. To my great disappointment, I found that after
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:05.000]   testing the feature, I can't make the chronological feed the default anymore.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:12.760]   Yeah. Instead, I can only have home as my default or swap back and forth between the two.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:21.160]   Yeah, of course, Twitter like YouTube and Facebook, they want algorithmically control
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:25.240]   what tweets you're seeing because they think it makes it better. You don't agree to Evan?
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:32.120]   I just get nostalgic and think of what it was like using Twitter in 2007.
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:33.480]   In the good old days.
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:36.680]   2007, those were the days.
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:43.320]   Your timeline shows the latest tweets. So don't do it. So right now, I'm seeing the latest tweets.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:49.320]   I don't change it because then you can continue to see the latest tweets, I guess.
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:57.080]   This is why a third party app, I still use a tweet deck, which the latest tweets scrolls much
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:00.120]   about. Actually, a tweet deck is owned by Twitter, isn't it? I know. I keep waiting for them to pull
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.120]   the plug because maybe they think nobody uses it. I use it.
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:13.560]   The most severe vulnerability in Linux in years, dirty pipe. Just be aware of it.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:23.960]   It's a privilege escalation exploit, which means somebody can basically become root on your machine
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:32.600]   without your permission. If they have a login, I think that it will be, I think it's probably
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:36.600]   been fixed on most versions of Linux. The real problem is these older
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:40.440]   systems like our server over here that don't get updated as often.
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:49.720]   It first appeared in Linux kernel version 5.8. It is fixed with 5.16, 11 or 5.15, 25 or 5.10,
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:59.880]   102. So just to be aware, unfortunately, Android runs on Linux and many Android versions are running
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:11.720]   on a vulnerable version. Heads up. Limeware is making a comeback. Ready? Remember Limeware?
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:18.840]   Unfortunately, it's a music NFT marketplace. Don't get your hopes up.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:29.880]   And prepare yourself, John. I know you're prepared for a massive coronal mass ejection,
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:36.840]   a long duration C2 solar flare. I'm just going to read this from space weather.
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:44.760]   A long duration C2 solar flare launched an asymmetrical full halo coronal mass ejection
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:49.880]   to space. The solar plasma cloud is likely to arrive at Earth later tonight.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:58.280]   Minor G1 geomagnetic storm conditions are likely with a chance of moderate G2 conditions. So prepare
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:04.760]   yourself. I have no idea what you just felt. I don't know either. Basically, I guess, I mean,
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:09.240]   it's a tweet. Basically, there it is, by the way, you want to see a coronal mass ejection.
[02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:16.440]   That's a coronal mass ejection, man. I think it means mostly really nice northern lights tonight.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:23.320]   I think mostly is what it means. If you're a ham, you know what to do. I don't think it's going
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:29.000]   to affect our technology. It's good in theory, right? So far, so good. Yeah, so far, nothing.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.320]   Just be just wanted you to warn more than you to prepare yourself. It could happen.
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:38.760]   Boy, that means we're scraping the bottom of the barrel if we've got if we've got to space weather.
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:44.520]   So I think it's time to say everybody go have a nice dinner. Carolina Milanese, thanks for staying
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:47.160]   up late with us. I really appreciate it. It's great to see you.
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:52.600]   Founder of the heart of tech. If you want to put some heart back into your business,
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:58.840]   a consultancy that helps you do the right thing. And of course, she is an
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:04.280]   analyst at Creative Strategies at Creative Strand. Anything you want to plug, Carolina,
[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:10.920]   this is your chance. I'm just, I'm on Twitter if you want to, you know, reach out and hit me up.
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:17.480]   That's what the kids say. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. You get bonuses of three cats and a dog that
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:25.000]   always show up on my feed. So it's not just tech. And then experimenting more and more on Instagram.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.720]   On both places, you can find me at Caro_Mylanese as you see on the screen.
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:36.120]   Nice. And yeah, and the kid is grateful that I am not attempting to talk because
[02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:40.280]   they're embarrassed enough as it is. Do they tick-tock? Do they have a tick-tock?
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:45.560]   No, they follow people. They're not really into creating content for tick-tock. They're
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:54.280]   more on the YouTube side. Yeah, nice. Very cool. Thank you very much, Larry Maggett,
[02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:58.280]   for being here. Appreciate it. It's always great to see you. Anything you'd like to plug besides,
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:02.040]   of course, connect safely.org? Yeah, I would say for those of you who aren't glued to
[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:06.040]   terrestrial radio and want to hear my CBS program, you can go to connect safely and
[02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:11.880]   look on the radio tab or on the podcast, webcast radio. It's only one minute long,
[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:15.960]   and I get to introduce some kind of cool people even in one minute. It's kind of a tweet on the
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:20.840]   air, so to speak. Yeah, you know, sometimes short formats not so bad. Yeah, make it really
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:25.720]   useful. Works for you to be doing. And by the way, when I say one minute, it is never 1.1
[02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:31.160]   minute. No, no. It's 59 seconds. It is one minute. It's really hard. You don't have to do 59.9.
[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:35.480]   Yeah, I might go with 59.9, but I wouldn't go with 60.1.
[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:40.760]   The stations might might jump out. I just got something I've always, you know,
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:46.040]   anybody's worked in radio used to carry a cassette player over your shoulder, big, heavy thing and
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:51.320]   then, yeah, remember the meringse? Yes. Always carried those around. Love those. And then,
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:56.280]   eventually, when solid state, it was like a little mini, like a little smaller. I just got this
[02:31:56.280 --> 02:32:02.680]   from Zoom. This is the Zoom F3 field recorder. Look at this. You could carry it in your pocket.
[02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:09.000]   It has a mic to mic. So you could actually have two mics. XLR. So you could do it. This is perfect
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:15.160]   for radio. And it does something I'm learning about called 32-bit float. Is that right? Yeah,
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:20.760]   32-bit float recording, which means you can't overdrive it. You could overdrive the mic,
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.880]   but you could have a loud noise, quiet noise, whatever, and you can fix it and post. So I'm going to,
[02:32:25.880 --> 02:32:30.360]   you know, if I come up to you and I got a microphone and you can't see what's on the other end,
[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:34.600]   it's probably in my pocket. Just like to do it. What's nice about that? You can use any of your
[02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:41.880]   analog mics, right? Yeah. It's still in 758. This is an SM58 clone from a company called Pile.
[02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:46.600]   Sounds really good. But yeah, you can just do handheld mic with a mic flag.
[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:52.760]   I'm excited. This is funny. I think I'm still in radio. I'm not, but I think I'm still in radio.
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:57.720]   So like I could go to CES to say Larry Maggot, CBS Radio News. What do you think?
[02:32:57.720 --> 02:33:02.680]   I don't know. That's it. I think that's a nice microphone. Yeah.
[02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:05.960]   What do you know, I would think if why aren't you doing this? Because everybody now you know.
[02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:09.640]   I know. I use it. This is better. This is better. I could get 99. I'm sure it is.
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:17.160]   0.99 hours on this. Evan Brown, Evan.law. Give us a plug.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:22.600]   Well, that's it. Go there. Read my blog. Tell your friends about it. You know, although in the
[02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:27.880]   right hand side is my Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. So we'd love to connect.
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:34.200]   I've just had a great time this afternoon. Thank you for having me. Larry, nice to meet you.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:40.760]   I've followed your work for years and years. Wonderful to be in the same context here.
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:45.560]   Carolina. Very nice to meet you. So intrigued to learn about you and the important things you're
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:49.080]   doing. So I would change your hand. I would scratch my screen.
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:55.960]   Thanks. Thanks for being here. Evan. I actually should plug Carolina's interview with Justine
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:34:01.800]   and Jenna in Forbes. The power of knowing you belong because we're big fans. And
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:08.760]   you know, Justine was a good people. Was a discovery Alex Lindsey made in Pittsburgh
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:15.160]   at a WordPress convention. He came to me and said, "You've got to meet this person. She's
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:21.240]   going to be huge since 2008, 2009, something like that." And she's been on our show many times.
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:26.360]   She's too big now for us so we can't get her anyway. So that's a great article. I can't wait to read it.
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:33.320]   Forbes. Thank you everybody. We do Twitter every Sunday evening, round 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern.
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:38.680]   Yes, we sprang forward today. Aren't you glad that I didn't go on and on about what a horrible
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:44.520]   idea it is to change the clocks twice a year? I just left that out. But now that we're in daylight
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:49.880]   saving time, you'll have to adjust because we moved. You may not have, in fact, around the
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:53.800]   rest of the world they haven't yet in many cases. They're not yet on summertime, but we are on
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:59.560]   summertime. So that means I'm just going to tell you UTC and you could do the calculations 21.30
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:06.120]   UTC on a Sunday afternoon. After the fact, you can get on to man versions of the show at the website
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:13.240]   twit.tv. There's a YouTube channel for this weekend tech. The longest running technology news show in
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:19.800]   the world. You can also, since 2005, you can also subscribe in your favorite podcast client and
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:24.920]   get it automatically. If you don't like ads, we do have an ad free version. I should tell you
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:30.600]   about all you have to do is subscribe to Club Twit, $7 a month, ad free audio or video of
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:35.720]   everything. Nope, that's the wrong one. Audio and video for everything that we do. There you go.
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:42.280]   And you get access to the great Club Twit Discord, which is a wonderful place for discussions. In
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:49.320]   fact, we have some events coming up. Paul Therat is going to do an event, an inside
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:55.320]   Twit style event. Patrick Delahanty did his yesterday day before. No, no, it's coming up this week.
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:57.880]   Our engineer, if you want to see some of the people behind this things, we're going to start
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:03.640]   doing those. We have Stacey Higabotham's Club Twit Book Club on March 24th. Corey Doctorow's
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:09.320]   unauthorized bread. Paul's will be on March 31st. So those Discord discussions are lots of fun.
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:13.720]   Plus you get the Twit Plus feed with his, which is filled, loaded with content that doesn't make
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.600]   it to the podcast. We also use the revenue from Club Twit to help us launch new shows. We just
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:24.520]   launched this week in space, started in the club. It's now available to the public at twit.tv/twist.
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:30.280]   So a lot of good stuff. Thank you to our Club Twit members. We appreciate each and every one of
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:37.800]   you. Twit.tv/clubtwit if you want to join the club. Thanks everybody. We'll see you next time.
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:51.640]   Another Twit. I'll see you soon. Bye.
