[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 41 for February 5th, 2006.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [Music]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   An unusual Twit because we're actually doing this during the lunch hour on Friday because I'm about to head off for the geek crews.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   But we did find some Twits who don't, either don't work for a living or can actually take lunch off.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   John C. Devorak, hello.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Devorak Downer/Blogg, Roger Chang.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Hello.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Are you working at the Fisherman's Gallery yet?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Gallleon.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   No, Mom and Dad's place.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Somebody asked me where, because he lives in Modesto, where I can have a good piece of fish.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It's Fisherman's Gallery, Rumble McHenry, on the corner.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And I'm really thrilled to have Kevin Rose here.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   We haven't talked to Kevin in an age.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Hey Kevin, how you doing?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Good, good. Hello, hello.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I really thank you for taking, I know you've been crazy busy with the dig and everything, so I thank you for taking some time off.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   No worries.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We have to ask you about the $30 million, what happened?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Yahoo was supposed to give you $30 million.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   That was just all rumors I got out of control.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It was really a strange couple of days there.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It was something that was posted on Dig about Yahoo, someone that was supposedly close to the negotiations or something about Yahoo buying Dig.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And then all of a sudden, I just commented on within the Dig comments that were focused on features, not something in the company.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And I woke up the next morning and it was on CNN money and just all over the web.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Oh, it was on CNN?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Oh wow, everybody picked it up.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It was crazy.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Well reliability issues of the internet.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yeah, stuff just kind of gets a life of its own.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hey, David Prager is also here.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Let me add him into the mix.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Another revision three employee.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   In fact, we have two revision three employees and no D.L.T.V. employees for change.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I think Patrick is traveling.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   A little bit technically because I work on the odd day for Patrick.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Oh good.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I could be kind of considering somebody representing them.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   David, we were just talking about the $30 million.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   You probably would have been rich too, huh?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   What $30 million.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I was going to have a Yahoo millionaire to it.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We have Joshua Shactor and Arlo Rose, Kevin Rose, Jason Calicanis.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It would have been a really cool thing.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Nice.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   If one more person gets bought by Yahoo with a last name of Rose, we could really have a party.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   How much did Arlo Rose get?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   We don't know.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The widget stuff, right?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He's a confabulator guy.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Dad, he got $30 million.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.600]   Kevin, you already denied it completely in the dig blog so there's no point in even belaboring
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   it.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   I just thought it was kind of...
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   I was rooting for you.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   I thought, yeah.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   Right along.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.200]   Well, you know, it's one of those things that where we stand today, I mean, dig is a geek culture
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   news website.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.000]   And right now, we don't want to sell the company.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We really want to show what dig is going to be here in the next few months.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.880]   And we're planning on expanding into new categories and rolling out a bunch of new features that
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.280]   no one really has anticipated us doing.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.560]   And we have some really cool stuff coming up and we don't think that now is a good time
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.760]   to sell and we like staying independent.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   You tell the truth.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.280]   You think you're worth more than $30, aren't you?
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.680]   No, that's not that.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.560]   It's more of just wanting to really...
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.480]   There's so many things that I have planned for dig that I want to see happen.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.320]   And once you never know what another company is going to do when they buy your company
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   and you can change fractions.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.280]   You haven't tell us at least one of them.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   What's that?
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   No.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   No.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.120]   Last week we did the show which we're going to discuss which...
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.520]   The show from hell...
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.720]   Moned about.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.320]   And we had a lot of these kinds of answers.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   You know, we got a guy...
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.720]   Well, you know, I can't tell you.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   I can't tell you.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.000]   I don't think people are really interested in listening to me.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   We can't tell you.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Right.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.560]   No, not to be critical, but you're not a public company.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.360]   So I don't see why you're being so secretive.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.080]   Well we do have a competition.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.120]   You know, there are other social news sites.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   You got nothing.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   What about news vise?
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.320]   Are you worried about news vise and all kinds of...
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   You know, news vise is interesting because what they do is they don't...
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.480]   There are actual stories.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.160]   A lot of their stories are pulled in via feeds.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   It's AP.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   I mean AP and ESPN.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   Right.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.680]   So they're pulling in content and it's really not the users that are submitting that content.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.760]   And we want to remain, you know, like this level playing field where the users actually
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.120]   have to submit the content to the site.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   Right.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.240]   And it's not being forced to push in front of anyone else.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.400]   Well they're probably not competition.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   Who is the competition?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.280]   You give us that much.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.800]   Who is the competition you're afraid of?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   I think it's probably someone that we really don't know is working on a project get it.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.400]   You know, if someone like, you know, a Google or Yahoo or someone Big Light that came out
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.160]   with some type of similar social news service, that would be more competition for us than
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.920]   a new startup because we already have kind of this critical massive users that are on
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   the site.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.680]   That takes time to duplicate but when you're a big company such as one of those guys then.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.840]   But those guys, they don't do that.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   They buy other people, at least they make a shot at it.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.680]   Even with Orca, they took a shot at Friendster before they rolled out Orca.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.720]   And they only do these kinds of deals when the company, the original company refuses to
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   do business with them.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   Right.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.320]   So I don't think they're working on anything.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.120]   They're working on probably doing financials on your site.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.000]   You know, reminds me the software industry where everybody was afraid of what Microsoft
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.520]   would do, should they weigh in.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.160]   Now in the web industry, everybody's afraid of Yahoo and Google.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.120]   But you don't think they should be?
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.800]   No, I don't think they should be.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.720]   Yahoo and Google are really good at buying other people up.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.040]   I mean, what has Yahoo ever developed on its own?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   I mean, just tell me.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.560]   I mean, give me an example.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.440]   They did their podcast thing on their own, didn't they?
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   Do they have one?
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   Well, okay.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   So maybe it's not the best known.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440]   Yeah, they do.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.120]   There, although there's rumors that maybe they'll buy ODEO.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.520]   So of course, we now know what worthlessness those rumors are.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.280]   Yeah, the rumors are crazy.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   Do you read this?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.720]   I mean, Josh Yachter was from Delicious.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.520]   It sent me an IM because they're, "Are we buying you?"
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.080]   Because we have a lot of office space up here.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.120]   You could probably be on the same floor as Delicious.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.200]   And I'm like, "Yeah, that would be cool.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   He's a cool guy."
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.360]   Is there a number in your mind, Kevin?
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.800]   Or are you really just not for sale?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.920]   Well, you know, you know, someone comes to the table and throws out some crazy, ridiculous
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   number.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.280]   I mean, I'm not going to be an idiot.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.200]   But at the same time, it's like, you know, we really want to expand into other areas and
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.040]   show what what did can do before we even entertain something like that.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.960]   So it's like we have a lot of what other areas we're talking about.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.840]   John picks now to play the journalist.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   What's the deal here?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.120]   Hey, I'm just telling you, after last week, somebody's got to do it.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.760]   You couldn't beat up on Was last week.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.240]   So you're picking our own here?
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   Yeah, I tried.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.480]   Well, you know, it's like we want to get beyond just tech news.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.120]   You know, right now we're so locked into this geek culture news and that, you know, we don't
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   cover world news.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.200]   We don't cover politics.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.400]   We don't, you know, we want to create, we want to really create Dig as a platform where
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.680]   users come to share information no matter what that information may be.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.760]   So you essentially want to broaden out your user base to include non-traditional kind of
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.360]   dig users?
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   Exactly.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.800]   Just get outside of where we are today and allow users to kind of share information in
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   unique ways.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   You're just talking about--
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   It's making service.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   It all ends up that way, doesn't it?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.360]   It's just what everything deteriorates.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.680]   It always ends up.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.080]   We'll talk about friends during a minute, by the way, but go on.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.680]   Yeah, but I think it's going to be interesting.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.320]   I think it is kind of not a matchmaking in the way that you see what, you know, you
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   go out on dates and find new people to meet up that way, but it is in that, you know,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.800]   we want to add a lot of smarts behind the scenes.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.320]   Dig is actually, you know, keeping track of and bookmarking every single story that you're
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   into.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.040]   So we're building like a social profile about that individual and we're able to, in the
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.240]   future, make recommendations on stories that you may not even have known as it have existed,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.000]   but will be recommended to you by the engine because we know the types of things that you're
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   into.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.840]   So if you're digging stories about Oolong Tea and, you know, AMD microprocessors, Dig will
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.080]   know that and be able to make specific words.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   Can't draw on your own connection ever.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.400]   So talking about that kind of thing, what do you think Yelp is up to?
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.760]   Because they have, you know, they're not doing what you're doing, but they have the one of
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.320]   the, I think the most interesting reviewer site out there because it allows you to see,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   you know, because, you know, we talked about Yelp the other day.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.760]   This is the site where it's like opinions where you can review anything, the golden
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.520]   gate bridge, Twitter, whatever, but you can't do it as an anonymous, these you can on these
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   other sites.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   And so you can kind of see what somebody's other opinions are.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.880]   And then you can check them out to see if this person is really thinking about you.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.760]   This is what social is all about though, isn't it?
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.280]   I mean, that's, I think part of it.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.840]   I think you're really smart, Kevin, because this is what Google has done so well.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.440]   They realized, wait, we're not a search engine company.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.160]   We can, we are really a company that aggregates information about people and can use it to
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   their advantage.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.400]   And I think that's very smart of you to see what your business really is.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.160]   Hey, it also comes in handy for those black helicopter.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.360]   What do you mean, John?
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.960]   Well, you know, they can track every, your every thought.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.720]   And then if you know, you get out of line a little bit, you know, one can fly over the
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   house and blow your way.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.280]   Oh, you can always move to China.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   Oh, yeah, that'll work.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.840]   So let's get this out of the way.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   Cause I know people want to know what happened last episode.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.280]   You missed this, Kevin, and you didn't miss anything.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.960]   I heard I saw, I saw something on it was on dig sites and yeah, everywhere with the deal.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.160]   John, do you want to take this?
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.960]   I can summarize it and I, and I, and that, I don't want to point fingers pointed at me.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   It's fine.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   I'll take full responsibility.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.800]   But you're familiar with the term gushing.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Yes.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   Well, Leo is gushing a little bit too much.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.960]   I think ultimately that's probably what the problem was.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   You're right.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.640]   Let's just go over a couple of facts here.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   One, generally speaking, I've worked with Leo as longer than anybody here.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.180]   And I can say this with some authority, which is Leo is probably as famous as anybody
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.160]   ever has on the show in some way.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.840]   Look at Juan has been at the personal fricking computer.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.600]   I'm not interested in an argument.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.920]   You know, in terms of like, you know, yeah, he didn't invent a computer 30 years ago.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:38.520]   But he was generally a famous person and he has a huge following of fans who expect,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.280]   you know, him to be kind of rise above it and not be a fan boy.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.960]   And when was, for some unknown reason, Leo and was in Mitnick of all people who seems
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.760]   to be following was they're very good friends.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.200]   In the same neighborhood, Leo falls apart.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   You're right.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.840]   And unfortunately, it's true, since he has control of the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.000]   Hey, if you had the wait a minute, wait a minute, I have no control of the show.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.880]   You have control of the show because you could actually hang up on everybody here.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.680]   Like you did with Patrick last week.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.720]   I'm not kidding.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.440]   I'm just kidding.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.960]   I don't know what happened to Patrick.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.920]   He says I didn't come back.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.240]   You know, Patrick said I he gave up.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   He was smart.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.400]   He had a good sense.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   Well, first he started the show under the car, which wasn't a good start.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.080]   So anyway, so my thinking is that unfortunately, Leo has this subtle self esteem issue with
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.960]   certain people.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.680]   And those people should never be allowed on the show.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.800]   John, I'm scared to death of you.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:43.720]   Oh, you know, you know, it's kind of funny of you, but I love you, man.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.360]   I love you, dude.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.480]   So John, you're telling me that there's no one in the world that if you ever met them,
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   you would act the same.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.360]   Yeah, who would you go over, John?
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   I would know.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   I'm not saying that, but I wouldn't be doing it on the radio.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.040]   Oswald Spingler.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.280]   I wouldn't be doing it in public.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   No, you're right.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   It was bad.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.680]   People that I think are really cool and know.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   I don't I don't I try never do like I don't I would not I wouldn't be go public with with
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.840]   my falling all over myself in that in that matter.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.880]   I just don't think it's interesting to anybody but me.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   I in my defense, I will say I was not aware of doing that, but in retrospect, you're absolutely
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   right now.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   I'll I'll cop to that.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.840]   And now I'm going to do the same thing with Kevin Rose because he's going to be worth
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   $30 million.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.520]   Well, this is the Charlie Rose syndrome, by the way, which Leo does exhibit a little
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.520]   bit of.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   And I think a lot of interviews do it.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   I'm a soft, I know.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.240]   Charlie Rose, if you ever listen to him do his show and he's got a rich guy on, he invariably
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.880]   starts talking about the guy's melt money.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.720]   And I saw him do a show once we went into somebody's house and he's looking at their
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.960]   art, asking him how much it costs.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   Unbelievable.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.800]   But Leo's to my opinion, Leo's to been in broadcasting too long to to to to fall apart
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   like that.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   And I was okay.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   And that's that.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   Anyway, I don't even want to be over critical about it, but I was told by a couple of people
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   that this show.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   I think that's accurate.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   I think that's actually I'm cop to that.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.320]   And listen to this because I've seen you talk to Steve wasneac and Nick, you probably
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.720]   have almost a dozen previous times.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   It was a little different because it's a pod.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.480]   And so I don't I don't have my journalistic armor on.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.320]   I am not a confrontational interviewer anyway.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   You know that, John.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.840]   I don't I don't like to get in a confrontational thing.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.720]   I'd rather insinuate myself.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.680]   No, I don't have a problem with that.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680]   You're a softballer.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   I'm a softballer.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.120]   There's a lot of people that do very well doing that, but generally when they're softballing,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.200]   they still maintain some, you know, they don't distance.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.000]   They try to do it a little bit less gushing.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   What did you I see?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.360]   And since I missed a show, what was the exact word that Leo uttered?
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.920]   I think when I said when I told was that I wanted to have his child, I think that might
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.720]   have gone over wine there.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   Is that could be good?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.960]   Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.640]   I mean, I was this to do it.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.800]   I was actually doing a lot of work on the offices.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   You were an observer.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   I tried to jump in every once in a while.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.200]   It goes back on track and talking about the news, but you know, nobody cared.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.080]   It was all was in the X was talking about his toys.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.320]   I don't think anybody cares that was spent 3500 bucks for a yellow laser.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   Seriously.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.560]   I think there's some interest in yellow lasers, but you're right.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.320]   And it's not going to happen again.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   Oh, well, that's I'm not counting on that.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.560]   Well, John, I count on the air.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.760]   It's the only time I get on the air.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.560]   I count on you, John, to say Leo, stop it.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.680]   Let me run a little bit.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.440]   So let's move on, shall we, Yang?
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   Because there is a lot of new.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.800]   Have you seen, by the way, I was going to ask Kevin about this valley wag.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   Have you seen this yet?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.960]   No, I haven't.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.920]   It's the Gawker media has done now what they did in Washington with Wong-Kett.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.200]   I did see that.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   They're doing with Silicon Valley.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.520]   It's a gossip conference Silicon Valley.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   You must have seen it, John.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.520]   Yes.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.520]   No, actually I'm out of it, too.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.200]   Well, I only launched a few days ago.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Well, what's the--
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   Give you an example of their angle.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   URL.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.920]   Valiwag.com, oddly enough.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.680]   The angle-- everybody's talking about-- I can hear everybody typing in the URL in the
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   banner.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   Let's see.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   Let's see.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.000]   The angle that everybody took about Google's downturn in the stock market was, you know,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   what did Google do wrong?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.360]   Is the stock market wrong?
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   What's the future?
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.040]   Valiwag said, well, but how much did Larry and Sergey lose?
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.400]   And they have an Excel spreadsheet.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.640]   And they figured out that it cost them $1.2 billion each.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.760]   The stock price drop.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.800]   Not that they're-- and I'm talking about money again, John, and I apologize for you.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.880]   But people are interested in money, sex and money.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   That's all they want to know.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.760]   By the way, that's the other thing Valiwag has been making a lot of hay about is Larry
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.560]   Page's ex-girlfriend, who I guess works at Google, and I couldn't care less about that.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.320]   Well, he has a new girlfriend, Lucy.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   Oh, he does?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.960]   I'm looking at the site now.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.720]   It's got the Google snack rooms up there right now.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.520]   It's a little inside-base pool.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.800]   Well, it's gossip, right?
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   The question is, does anybody care about the-- you know, it's not Brad and Jeff.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   It's behind this.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   Do we know who's behind this?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   Yeah, it's Gawker.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   It's Gawker Media.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.080]   You know, it's the same people do all the other Gawker Media things.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   I can't remember his name.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.600]   What's the Gawker's name, guy's name?
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.440]   I guess they don't like Tony Perkins.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   No.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:29.680]   There was just a picture of the Gawker guy and his stable of bloggers in Vanity Fair.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   I think it was.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.560]   Well, he's good enough to get that kind of PR.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.120]   Yeah, I mean, that's pretty good.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.080]   Instapunded is one of theirs, Wonkhet.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   Oh, OK.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   I got it.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.080]   You know, it's exactly what Jason was doing.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   Very slick.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.800]   It's a little too slick for my taste.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.880]   Well, I like Devorx/org.blog.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   I mean, Devorx.org/blog.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.480]   Yeah, it's amateurish.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.960]   It's perfect.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:59.320]   We're doing a new podcast with Dick D'Vartolo, and we decided that we don't want to have
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320]   good music.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.880]   We want to have a Cacio, cheap Cacio organ for the really cheesy--
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   Wesley Willis.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   It's a great idea.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   Yeah, just kind of--
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   [SINGING]
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.160]   I used to get a kick out of the-- I listened to the sports talk.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.880]   You know, now you can condemn me for that.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.640]   But Jim Rome, when he did his first show on TV, he used to have this amateurish girl
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.040]   who sounded like a cheerleader or something, do the voice over the announcements.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.440]   And I thought it was really funny.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   Jim Rome.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   You know?
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.200]   And now it's time for you know, just this amateurish writer.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.520]   Back about falling all over the worst people in that business are the sports guys.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.520]   I mean, they just gush like crazy.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.880]   Oh, I don't think Jim Rome doesn't.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.320]   No, Jim Rome actually took a good opposite.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   That's why he's good.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.840]   He's the hard ass, as it were.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   That's why he's good.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.840]   He's actually kind of mean.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.480]   I think he's one of the best radio guys in working today.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   Yeah, I know.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480]   I think he's great too.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.640]   Well, Hiddley, the host of Twit next week.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.040]   What's the Dick D'Vartolo show?
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   It's Daily Giz Wiz.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   Daily.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   Cool.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   Well, I thought we'd do it.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.800]   There's a questionable name for a show.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.080]   I think Kevin Rose did it for you.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   Do it every day.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   I messed up.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.680]   Kevin did it in review and the prompter says the G-I-Z-W-I-Z and Kevin pronounced it just
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680]   perfectly.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.160]   I said it was the Giz Wiz.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.000]   On national television.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   I think that's what David was referring to.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   I know.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   It was embarrassing.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.160]   I've said it once.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.200]   That was the thing people like most about the screensavers.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.680]   There wasn't really very much national television was it?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   Not even close.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.720]   I used to call it a station.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.680]   And then I'd always get reprimanded by people like Hammers.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.240]   He says, "You got to catch the stop thinking of a station."
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   Station's a network.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   Station's a network.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   It's a noop.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   I could never call it a network either.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   I had a hard time saying network.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.240]   Network you think CBS, NBC?
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.720]   I took it to the channel.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:53.160]   So speaking of more abundant websites that are back from the dead, Friendster just got
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   a big infusion of money from Kleiner Perkins.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   What's that all about?
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   Oh, really?
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   How much did they get?
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   A few million.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.600]   It's like it was...
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.840]   What's the story here?
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.520]   I didn't know that, but I think I know why.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   Why?
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.040]   Because I've talked in the past with some people over there about what they're thinking.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.920]   The CEO left like a month ago.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.840]   And they get all this money from KP.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   I don't know this.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.240]   This is pure speculation based on some things I've been told by venture capitalists specifically
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.800]   from Kleiner Perkins.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.440]   They believe that the model of social networking that is used by LinkedIn and Friendster and
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:35.760]   these other things can be kind of either split off or turned into some sort of a back end
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.520]   or you can do something with it in such a way that every corporation can use it to develop
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.320]   customer relationships and it can be incorporated in CRM stuff.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.440]   So I think there's an ulterior motive here.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.680]   What's just what you were talking about in a way, Kevin was a dig, except you're not doing
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   CRM, but the same idea, right?
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   Yeah, but Friendster, I mean, unless they have something behind the scenes that they haven't
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   shown us yet, it's effectively a dead site, right?
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   I mean, everyone's jumped to MySpace for...
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.160]   We're talking about the software, Kevin, not the site itself.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.080]   Right, but I mean, how hard is that to duplicate?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   Is it...
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.880]   You ever talked to some of these venture capitalists?
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.280]   They can be buffalode.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   We all went crazy with...
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.080]   You'll find that out shortly when you get the $80 million.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:24.560]   We went crazy when Friendster came out when it was in 2003, 2002, I can't remember, and
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.000]   we all joined and everything.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.720]   We got sick of it pretty quick.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:34.600]   You know, the irony of Friendster to me is that they pulled an exact same blunder that
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.360]   point cast did, which is not take the money when they had the shot at it.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   They were all...
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.800]   That and that just, they couldn't scale well.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   I mean, part of the reason why so many people left initially was that they had such a hard
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.600]   time keeping up with the demand.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.080]   So many people were joining.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   You could never get on.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   You were getting kicked off.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   There was air.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.640]   And then all of a sudden MySpace came out of nowhere, had the ability to share music,
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.080]   and then just the kids latched onto it and everyone jumped ship.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.160]   Yeah, it's a fickle market.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   It is.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.960]   It's scary in a way.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.040]   You're a bold, brave guy, Kevin, to do in this because it's tough.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.240]   And you can use this a little bit different, but yeah, it's fun.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.160]   Yeah, I bet it is.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   I bet it's very exciting.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   It's G4.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   Do you sleep at nights?
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.000]   No, actually I do now.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   I didn't used to.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   It's going to be scary.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.640]   Well, there's all the channels on G4.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.200]   Anything, it's G4.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   Okay.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   Golf channel is owned by the same people that own G4.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   Is it?
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Yep.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   Comcast owns a golf channel?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   Yep.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.680]   In fact, the corporate offices of the golf channel in the exact same place as G4, you can
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.200]   be walking between cubes between the golf channel and G4 people.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   Weirdness.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   Oh, that's right.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   David was dating.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.800]   Weren't you dating a girl from the golf channel?
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   I wasn't dating a girl.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.320]   I went out with a girl.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.880]   I went out on a date kind of maybe you did not even call that from the golf channel.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.880]   That's right.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.080]   Did you want to see your fault?
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   Oh, come on now.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.400]   Hey, what can I argue?
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   You could take it out.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.440]   But that means I have to now go back and edit.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440]   Let me write down that.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   It's just balls.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   You don't have to edit anything.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440]   Just bleeping.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   It is a button.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.800]   But Kevin, you should be careful what you say because I can come right back at you with
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   all kinds of stuff.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   Speaking of it, I know you can.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.400]   You know, it's kind of funny you mentioned that.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   Oh, no.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:26.880]   Remember the, you were the day we were up in the Gomgate theater over in Corda, Madeira?
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   Was it?
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   It was like two weeks ago.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.680]   And one of you asked me about GameSpot.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   Prager did.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   I did.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   Or what I said, I made a comment about it.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.320]   Well, it somehow got back to my little job.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   Oh, no.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   What do they say?
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   What do they do?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.960]   Nothing, but I just heard like Tom.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.200]   Were they mad at you?
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.840]   Well, if you say what you thought about what the way the operation was run where you worked,
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.280]   then you're being honest and telling people.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.840]   I've got news for you guys.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.280]   I know it's kind of hard to believe that they're actually are people listening to this.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   Well, they didn't actually see the thing.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.480]   It's kind of stunning, frankly.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.920]   It was, it was just quiet.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.240]   It was, yeah.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.920]   So just, yeah, just watch what you say.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   Let's get under the news.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.560]   There's a article that was posted on the delicious slash twits site, which is kind of
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   interesting.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.920]   I was wondering how it got under the ESPN dot org thing.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   I put that up there.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.480]   You're a big fan because you say now you're going to put everything on ESPN.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   Let me explain what it is.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.680]   And then you can tell me why I'm full of it.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.640]   So you all know about ISBN, the international standard book number, every book, every publication,
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.440]   in fact, print publication in the world has an ISBN number.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.200]   It's a unique number.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.840]   And libraries use it for classification.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.160]   It's easy to find books that way.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.640]   I can use it on Amazon.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:45.080]   I'm not sure who has proposed a ESPN number, an electronic standard book number.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.800]   The idea is that just as there's an ISBN for print publications, there should be a 10 digit
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.400]   ESPN number for all audio, video and images on the net.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.240]   And I think this is a great idea.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:04.080]   I think having a, you know, we all podcasts currently have a unique identifier for each
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   show.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.840]   Often it's the link to the show, what it can be, other things.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.440]   But it's, there's no standard for this.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.560]   So I've, I've unilaterally going forward going to make all put an ESPN number instead as our
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.720]   unique identifier and a legitimate ESPN number.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.360]   The only, it's a little cumbersome because you have to upload a copy of the work to ESPN.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.960]   That's the only drawback to it.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   All right.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.720]   It's going to be like a meta tag that's embedded in everything or something you just assigned
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   to it.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.680]   It's in the RSS feed and presumably down the road, there would be tools to search and categorize
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   in class.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.120]   This is going to have to be a huge number.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.200]   They're going to have to be do it like IP.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.000]   I, I miss, yeah, I miss spoke.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.760]   ISBNs are 10 digits.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.560]   ESPNs are 19 digits, which is plenty.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.560]   That's a lot.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.040]   19 digits.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.400]   What is that 10 in the 19th?
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   It's plenty.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.920]   Well, you know, I don't know.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.200]   It seems to me, I have mixed feelings about jumping on every bandwagon.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.360]   Oh, I like to though.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.360]   You know me.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   And I know you do.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.920]   And it, which is interesting because it brings it up to the bubbling point where you can actually
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.000]   discuss it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.360]   But it seems to me that I thought search engines were at some point going to eliminate the
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.840]   need for this sort of thing where we, you know, what, why do you need to have this secondary
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   system of numbering, which always turns out to be ISBN is a good example.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.440]   It turns out to be some commercial enterprise.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.800]   You have to pay a lot of money now to those ISBN numbers.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.600]   It's kind of a rip off.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   And that's what concerns me.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   I don't know.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.320]   Maybe the idea is good and might simplify things.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.200]   But it just seems to me that and maybe search engines are going to finally collapse on their
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.640]   own under their own weight and it will be useless in the future.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.440]   And I guess then you'd be laughing.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.280]   The problem is using this search search engines only go so far with audio content.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.600]   No, I say with audio and video, you might be on the right track here because there's some,
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.000]   you know, although there's some audio search engine.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I run into this.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   There's pods.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   There's pods.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Singer is incredible.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.240]   There's actually three TV eyes, which has been doing this for years as a service for
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.560]   like a clipping service with people with real TV stations is doing it.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.240]   The EBN, Bolt-Barranican Newman, the folks who practically invented the internet have
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.680]   their own service, which is called Blitz or something.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   There's three of them.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.520]   And actually they do very well.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.720]   But I, you know, esbn.org if you want to learn more about it.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.520]   They will also have barcodes.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.520]   You know, you're right.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.680]   It could be the flavor of the month.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.840]   There is a Firefox extension that makes it a little bit easier to do it.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.040]   It's actually a good idea, I think, for bloggers.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.640]   Although again, it's not as necessary for bloggers as it is for audio and video.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.880]   I just think if it was for bloggers, you'd need to put it to about 25 digits.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   Right.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   Right.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   We're all ready.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.000]   We're all ready doing it.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   You know, every podcast does it.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.080]   It's part of the RSS feed with a unique identifier, but there's no global system.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.240]   So I just think it's good to have a global system.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.000]   By the way, on the Twitter website, you have it linked to plagiarism today.com instead
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   of ESPN.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.640]   Yeah, that's an article about it.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.160]   And I see that I never saw the site before, but I got a kick out of it.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.280]   The name of the site is plagiarism today, exploring the wasteland, plagiarism.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.680]   I mean, these guys going on and on about plagiarism.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   Where's all this plagiarism?
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   I don't know.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   What's he talking about?
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   I don't know.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.040]   It's actually a blog, and it's kind of a funny blog.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   But that's...
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.400]   I mean, there's kids that steal from other people's papers, but since when is that new?
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   I don't know.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   I think there's a lot of plagiarism.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.080]   I think cutting-paste makes it very easy to take somebody's ideas and post it.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.280]   I mean, that happened to me.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.240]   We have a private forum for Twit members now.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.240]   There's another Bruha I don't want to go into.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   But I...
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   And I...
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   I see, you know, I had a bad week.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   What can I say?
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   You're going for punishment.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.440]   I think it was something we should have done a long time ago, and it's actually really
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.320]   a great place if you guys go in there, you'll see.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.560]   Because we can speak freely, right?
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.520]   So a couple of members, a cut and paste, things that I'd said about the future of Twit
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.400]   to newsvine.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.320]   And I said, you know, that's not in the spirit of this.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.560]   They didn't put it in Dig?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.840]   Oh, they pulled it from the forum, and then they ripped you off, in other words.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840]   They burned you.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.040]   No, it's not that they're getting burned by our fans.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.240]   No, I'm not getting ripped off.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.720]   It's that if you can't speak privately in a private forum, it kind of makes the private
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.200]   forum not very useful.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.440]   It's totally private if you have some sort of recourse to hunt them down.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   Well, I do.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.360]   And they're going to get a knock on the door very soon from the FBI.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.800]   But that's another matter entirely.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.360]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   It's plagiarism.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   I'm just kidding.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   Yeah, somebody will take that out of kind of thing.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.920]   I'm just kidding.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.600]   I do have friends at the Secret Service.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.800]   I guess something you should probably just edit that out to be safe.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.480]   I got a letter from somebody the other day, and I'm going to post this on my blog probably
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.400]   on by the time this podcast is out.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.200]   What would that address be?
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   Dvorak.org/blog.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.920]   Some guy, there's a website out there, and some guy has actually done every imaginable
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:51.880]   benchmark on a hot AMD motherboard using 512K, 1 gigabyte and 2 gigabytes.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.440]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   And apparently once you get to a gigabyte, it's just like hopeless.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.640]   You might as well just, you're just wasting your money by putting two or four gigabytes
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   on these motherboard.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   We've always said that.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.160]   Haven't we, Kevin, and all our benchmarks in the past, I think if Patrick's over?
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   You guys have been saying this all along?
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.080]   Well, I think it's kind of been an unknown, you know, with all these new games coming
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.880]   on, everyone's always saying, oh, you should have two gigs of RAM, you know?
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.040]   There's that, there's bigger textures, you know, but I guess that's not the case.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   I read that article too.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   It was interesting.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.360]   I think that it's certainly up to, you know, has been the case all along, which is there's
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.240]   a, you know, it's diminishing returns and it really diminishes quite a bit past a gig.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240]   I think that's Windows.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.480]   Well, actually, it doesn't even show it diminishing.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.720]   It shows that it just, it actually, in some cases, goes down.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.880]   Well, that could be, yeah, sure.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.760]   Because of the overhead, I should go exactly.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.560]   Right, probably because it's trying to cash it off.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.280]   So what about, did you see this e-week article, Larry S. Citzer is saying, or Celtzer, I'm
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.920]   sorry, is saying, with IE7, ActiveX is dead.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   Which is great.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.320]   Well, that would be great, but you know, I'm not convinced of this.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.000]   I mean, I think that they're going to, you'll see ActiveX2 or something like that.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.880]   These guys are long-term subscribers of this concept.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.800]   ActiveX is one of the reasons that Windows and IE are dangerous.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.680]   It essentially allows any website to execute code on your computer.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:16.120]   I mean, real code, not scripted code, not sandbox code, real code, Windows code.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.680]   I think this is not a bad idea.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.720]   Now, what they're going to do is they're going to build these capabilities directly
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.320]   into IE7, at least according to Celtzer.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.040]   Yeah, but what do you need?
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.200]   What does ActiveX provide today?
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   Right.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   Nothing.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   Right?
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.240]   Well, it allows you, it provides you something valuable, which is to be able to run code
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.800]   on everybody who visits your site.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's a computer, but that's inherently dangerous nowadays.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Yeah, but I'm saying as an IE user, let's just say you had IE install, like, I wouldn't
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.520]   actively go out and look for a specific ActiveX application installed, right?
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   Well, yes, you might.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.560]   The virus scanners, the spyware scanners, Windows update, all use ActiveX, and they
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   kind of have to.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.800]   I mean, you could, you know, they're trying to write one of the, I think, house call in
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.880]   Java, but I think it's difficult because Java is so sandboxed.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.320]   You need access to the hard-running access to the files.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.040]   But you need the ActiveX to do all that though.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.080]   I mean, why would you need for a virus scanner to have active, you know, use ActiveX?
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.920]   Well, it's going to be more effective if it can run on your computer, isn't it?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.560]   I wonder how right, I met with the people from rightly.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   They live up in Portobello.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560]   That's Java, I think, isn't it?
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.000]   Well, I think it's, no, I think they wrote in C#.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   No, they did.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   They wrote in C#.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.800]   So that would be ActiveX there?
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.080]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.360]   But they told me that they're going to recode it in Java.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.360]   So I don't know.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.440]   I don't know if that's true because I can run it on Mac.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:39.360]   So I think that it, unless it's different on Windows, I think it must use Java.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.280]   Well, that's a good, that's an interesting question.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   I've been wrong about that before.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   Well, you understand this thing.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   For all we know, it uses Flash.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.200]   This thing should have been, this ActiveX thing should have been killed years ago.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.880]   It's not so, it certainly won't be mourned by me.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.240]   But the real concern would be if Microsoft puts the same capabilities into IE7.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.880]   I guess you could just not use IE7.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.720]   Hey, speaking of which, Kamasutra, what happened?
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.240]   Yeah, it was a big die.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.560]   Everybody's thinking about the Indian book of love.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.040]   I wrote that up as a throwaway column for MarketWatch.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.600]   That was a crappy week for me too.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.880]   I hadn't had a decent thought all week.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.520]   My prediction was it was going to be a big die.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.320]   It always is lately, isn't it?
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:30.040]   No, my observation is that any time a virus or a worm gets a lot of pre-publicity, like
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.440]   lots of it, like this one did, they always become duds because everyone updates and they
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.840]   check and they're a little more cognizant and nothing ever comes of it.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.320]   And people stop opening attachments and that kind of thing.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.480]   You know who got bit by Kamasutra?
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.480]   People whose clocks were set three or four days ahead.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.160]   What was that?
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.280]   I like to be ahead of myself.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.840]   Well, and you got to figure it's probably some new, right?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.440]   Some guy who really doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.280]   And of course, that's who's going to get bit by Kamasutra.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.600]   How long was the last time you guys got hit by a virus?
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.160]   It's been like years for me.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.880]   For most people, it doesn't even matter anymore.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.040]   You have a virus scanner, it gets the updates and you're done, right?
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.120]   It's not a matter of, I don't think being hit, but once in a while something will sneak
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.440]   onto the system and usually catch it pretty early on.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.240]   It doesn't do any damage or it doesn't really stay there or linger.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.840]   I found something on my system.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.720]   Oh, actually, a couple of years ago, remember when that worm, that network worm was going
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.960]   around and it would found it, found a port and got onto the machine with a little bit
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   of a reboot?
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   And sasser, sasser.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.400]   Yeah, that got on one of my laptops and it, you know, it took me like a few days to get
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   rid of it.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.800]   I mean, we had an issue with, well, at least call for help because I didn't have enough
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   time.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.960]   But yeah, when I was Florida, I think three machines got.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   You know, it's in there.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   So to this day, if you put a Windows XP service pack one machine on the internet, you'll get
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.920]   sasser within two minutes instantly.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   Really?
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.560]   Yeah, because it's like herpes, it's endemic.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   It's just floating.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.800]   No, it's floating around the net all the time.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.080]   And if you put an unprotected machine out there, you will get it.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.560]   Which is actually, I just finished slip streaming all the updates into my window to install
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   this.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   That's a good idea.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.560]   When installed, it has all the, at least as of yesterday, the update.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.360]   What did you use to do the slipstream?
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   Enlight.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   Enlight's great.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   What's the URL?
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.760]   For Enlight is that?
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.400]   It's free software.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.760]   It's kind of a weird Enlight OS.com.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:35.720]   It's designed so that you can, it's actually really more than just slip streaming, but that's
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   the main people reason.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.800]   Actually, you can set defaults and turn off a certain features that you don't want installed.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.600]   Create a custom Windows installed.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.440]   Yeah, and it's great.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.600]   I mean, I wish I would have done it sooner because when I build a new PC, I don't have
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.240]   to go to the hassle of, even though I actually keep all the updates on a separate CD, I
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.080]   don't have to like, you know.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   Right.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.080]   Was it pretty easy to do?
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:06.960]   It took me, I mean, the biggest hassle really was just getting all the updates off the Microsoft
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.560]   site and like some of the, yeah, we're past.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.680]   Yeah, you have to tweak your Windows to get it just as you want it before you do the slips
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.920]   the Enlight thing.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:24.320]   Hey, speaking of money, sling, $46 million investment.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   Sling media?
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   Sling box, yep.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   Wow.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.200]   That's from Hearst, Echo Star, the dish folks and Mobius.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.480]   I don't get it.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.640]   Oh, I get it.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.880]   Have you played with sling?
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   It's pretty cool.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.960]   Yeah, it is, but I don't see that it's so proprietary that somebody can't just duplicate
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.720]   the whole concept in software.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.000]   Hmm, interesting.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I think it's the fact that it's just a box that sits on your TV.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.040]   The watch is cool looking, by the way.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   Cool.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.440]   I think that's the world's worst industrial design.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   I've never seen an ugly.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   Oh, I'm kidding.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.480]   It looks like a, it looks like a, it looks like a, it's just an, it looks so blue round.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.840]   You can look it up on, uh, dework.org/blog.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.840]   It's hideous.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840]   John, what are you thinking?
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   That's ugly.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   It looks cool.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   It looks very German.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   It looks like something.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   It doesn't matter what it looks like.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.920]   It looks, well, I'll tell you, it's a silver, plastic silver about the size of it.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.600]   It looks like a, a bar of gold bullion, right?
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.500]   Except that it's plastic and it's got the weirdest writing on the top, which is done
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.280]   like they took the plastic mold and they poked it with a pin to spend letters, spell letters.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.240]   You know, my DVR, you know, my, it is, you know, and by the way, the technology is super
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   cool effective.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.680]   You know, I can, I understand where you're coming from with this.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.400]   By the way, they want it to look cool, whoever asked that question so they can sell it best
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   buy.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.240]   So when people walk by, they say, wow, this is cool looking.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   I'm going to buy.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   Where you certainly see it.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   Do they have any competitors?
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.800]   Because right now, I mean, I, I don't know any other way where you can get your average
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.440]   Joe to be able to basically log into your home television and watch whatever the hell
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   you watch.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.160]   Explain what, how it works, David.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.640]   I've never used it, but basically what you do is you stick.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   I mean, no, you used it.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   You want me to explain?
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   Yes.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   You know, you do it.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   I can explain it.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640]   You can explain.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   I'll correct you if you missed it.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.840]   Okay, you correct me here.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.160]   You can record anything you want from your TV, from what your TV is able to access from
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.600]   your provider.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.680]   And if you happen to be anywhere with an internet connection around the world, you can log into
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.920]   that box that's on top of your TV and watch anything that you've recorded on your local
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   stuff.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.040]   So if you decide you want to watch the, you know, the Giants game that's only broadcast
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.080]   on Fox Sports West and you happen to be in Thailand, well, you can watch it.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.480]   So you're watching your Tivo, your cable, your stuff.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.640]   Yeah, am I right?
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.640]   Yes.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.880]   And then the one neat A plus, David.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.440]   Old stock, Old Star.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.440]   Yes.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   Okay.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.360]   For bonus credit that they're really cool.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.000]   And I think the reason you're getting investment from these guys, the really cool app is if
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.960]   you have a Windows mobile enabled cell phone, you can watch it on your cell phone.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.320]   Yeah, they did that though.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.840]   I think only as a result, you know, there is a competitor call.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.120]   I think it's Orb Networks out of Emeryville.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.600]   It's a paste for service and they kind of do the same thing on the use server somehow.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.440]   I'm not sure what the architecture is, but they're the ones who came up with the idea
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.520]   of showing it on the cell phone immediately.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.400]   I think that's very cool.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.440]   Now along with that Verizon has announced that basically they're going to have their
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.160]   own television network on the cell phone.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   Did you see that one?
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.360]   Yeah, I don't know what they're thinking.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.440]   I don't know get that at all.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.200]   There's a lot of weird television stuff going on there.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:23.920]   I'm the one that's article that got me kind of interested is CBS kicking Google videos
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   off the island.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.480]   Yeah, they're going to distribute the, they're going to distribute the video themselves,
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.240]   which I always wondered why, you know, CBS is, at least networks, why are they going
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   through iTunes?
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   Why are they going through Google?
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.720]   They can just do with themselves.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.880]   Well, luckily we got, you know, Larry Kramer working there now and he's at least most of
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880]   what's going on.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.360]   So I think he's behind this.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.680]   Well, people don't want to have to do is they don't want to have to go to Google video
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.760]   to watch CBS shows and then go to iTunes to watch ABC shows.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.360]   They want to, I mean, I don't want to have to do that.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.640]   Well, I guess, I mean, it's the idea is to have it in a centralized place, but.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.360]   Well, you know, all you need is like a centralized site that links to all the other sites.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.960]   Yeah, it's just a, a direct.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.440]   Well, I mean, right now for most podcasts, you can, you can find Twit on audio.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.600]   You can find it on, you can find it on iTunes.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.400]   Yeah, I'll expect that though.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   Right.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   You have to think about the DRM that's also included in that.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.000]   I just, iTunes, they're rolling out so many new TV shows.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's unreal.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.160]   That might be why, that might be why CBS is worried that they'll be lost in the shuffle.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.280]   I just bought a series two of Bellsar Galactical last night on iTunes music store.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   The whole thing?
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   Wow.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   What is it?
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   Battle stories are classic.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   Oh, that's right.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.280]   You, you like that show.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   I am, that shows awesome.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.440]   Oh, thank you, Roger.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.920]   You just like the blonde chick.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   Oh, yes.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   There's two blonde chicks.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.160]   There's a Canadian and then there's that one other chick that plays the evil blonde
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   chick.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.560]   I think it was the one who used to be the evil blonde chick on the old, uh, show in San
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.560]   Francisco with, uh, the guy from Miami vice.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   Nash bridges.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   Nash bridges.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:00.680]   Well, she's actually going to host a version of, um, not, it's not a, it's not a, no,
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.640]   who wants to be a model in Canada or America's top model?
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.000]   America's top model or that's a good show.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.720]   Actually, America's top model in Canada.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.800]   North America's top model.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.720]   How long is that?
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.400]   You know, you laugh, but there's things like that all the time on Canadian TV.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.920]   Oh, no, I've, I've noticed that that's, that's Canadian TV right there.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   Canadian Idol for a while.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.200]   They do have Canadian Idol, but they also show American Idol.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   Right.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   That's the first thing.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.160]   Canadians are wacky.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.520]   So, uh, battle struggle, actica.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.160]   Do you watch it?
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.760]   Kevin on your iPod or do you watch it on the TV?
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.160]   No, just on the laptop.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.600]   Oh, so you, oh, okay.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   So you buy it.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.000]   It's in iTunes and then you just expand it in your laptop.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.480]   I'm just waiting for Apple's little device that I can plug into the wall and then stream
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   it to my TV.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   That'll be coming soon.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   I'm sure.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.480]   Yeah.
